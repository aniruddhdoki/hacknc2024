  "text": "Investing\nA Beginner’s Guide to Investing\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes, many brokerages have no minimum account size and will offer zero-commission trading, allowing you to begin investing with even very small amounts. In fact, now with many brokers offering fractional shares, you can invest in stocks even if their share price is over $1000.\nWhile there are many ways to invest in stocks, one of the easiest and best ways for beginning investors to do so is to open up a retirement account with a discount broker. These accounts have tax advantages when saving for retirement and many different brokers have ones that cost little or even nothing to have.\nWhile you can’t invest with zero money, you can invest with very little. Many stock brokers offer accounts with no minimum balance and no trading commissions so almost any amount you add to your account can be used to invest.\nYou should invest because investing allows your savings to go farther than they otherwise would. Simply holding your savings as cash means it will just sit and be slowly diluted by inflation, whereas even in the safest investments it will earn some money for you, building on itself.\nAs soon as you can afford to. Because investment returns compound, that is, the money you earn from investing then earns money, the sooner you begin investing, the more time you give for this process to work.\nIn the U.S. stock markets major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are open from 9:30 .a.m to 4.p.m Eastern Time. However, this varies around the world depending on what exchange you’re looking at and whether that day is a holiday.\nKey Terms\nBond\nA bond is an investment representing part or all of a loan to a person, government, or other entity. Bonds are issued at a set par value, usually $1000 or $100, and their prices fluctuates based on interest rates and perceived credit-worthiness of the borrower.\nBond Yield\nA bond’s yield is the investment return that an investor will gain from a bond, usually expressed as a percentage. This is the percent of the bond’s price that each set interest payment will be. Yields go up as a bond’s price goes down and vice versa because they are a percent of the bond’s value, therefore the higher the bond’s price, the lower a percentage of that value a set interest payment will be.\nTechnical Analysis\nTechnical analysis is a form of stock analysis that involves looking at the price movements of stocks over time in order to predict where they will go. It attempts to find patterns in stock movements based on statistical trends such as the moving average of a stock or its trading volume. This contrasts with fundamental analysis which looks at the financial values of the business that issued the stock and economic conditions affecting the market and that business in order to assess where a stock’s price will go.\nSector Breakdown\nA sector breakdown is a way to look at a portfolio by organizing it by which sector of the economy each stock is in. This allows an investor to, depending on their investing strategy, avoid stocks from companies in sectors they don’t believe to have strong prospects, focus on stocks from sectors they believe are in a good position for growth, or ensure their portfolio is diversified.\nShort-Term Investments\nShort term investments are investments that are designed to be held for a year or less or investments a company intends to sell within 12 months. They are also known as “marketable securities” or “temporary investments,” and can be easily sold for cash.\nInvestment Banker\nAn investment banker works for a bank that deals mostly with raising capital for large institutions such as governments and corporations. They also deal with corporate restructuring as well as corporate mergers & acquisition (M&A).\nWall Street\nWall Street is a street in New York City which, due to having been a historical center of the U.S. financial industry, is used as a term to refer to that industry as a whole. It is often contrasted to Main Street, which is used as a term to represent the broader economy outside the financial industry, especially small businesses.\nExplore Investing",

  "text": "Stock Investing Essentials\nStock Investing Essentials\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe most expensive publicly-traded share of stock of all time were the Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), Warren Buffet’s conglomerate and holding company as of January 2022. They hit $487,675 per share on Jan 18, 2022.1 It’s important to remember that this does not mean it is the most valuable company by stock value. The value of a company’s stock, or “market capitalization,” is determined by multiplying the price of its shares by the number of its shares.\nAs of early 20222, the all-time closing high of the Dow Jones is 36,799.65 points, which it reached on January 4, 2022. The index’s all-time intraday high was 36,952.65, reached on Jan 5, 2022.\nUnrealized gains or losses represent the amount you would gain or lose if you sold your investment, often a stock, at its current value. You “realize” these gains or losses when you actually sell the investment.\nWhen people talk about stocks, they are usually referring to common stock, which is stock that usually gives voting rights in shareholder votes. Preferred stock almost never confers voting rights, but if a company only has enough money to pay some of its dividends, it has to pay preferred stock dividends first. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders on company assets.3\nCyclical stocks are those that tend to rise and fall with the broader economy, falling when the economy is doing poorly and rising when the economy is doing well. Non-cyclical, often also called defensive stocks, tend have steadier performance that do better when the economy is down are down but peak less high during boom years.\nKey Terms\nStock\nStock is a type of investment representing ownership of a business. A unit of stock is called a share.\nLearn More\nStandard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index\nThe S&P 500 is an index of the stocks of 500 large U.S. companies that make up about 80% of the U.S. stock by market capitalization. It is a benchmark for large-cap U.S. stocks and is often used as a proxy for the U.S. stock market as a whole.\nCyclical Stock\nCyclical stocks are stocks that tend to rise and fall in line with the broader economy. Cyclical stocks include those of technology, finance, and energy companies. This contrasts with defensive stocks which tense to have steadier returns, drop less when the economy falls, and rise less when it grows.\nCommon Stock\nCommon stock is a security that represents partial ownership of a company. When people colloquially refer to “stock” this is what they mean. It contrasts with preferred stock, a type of security that has aspects of both bonds and stocks.\nPreferred Stock\nPreferred stock is company stock that is issued at a fixed par value, similar to a bond, and that does not confer voting rights, but has priority over company earnings when allocating dividends and priority over common stock in bankruptcy proceedings. Preferred stock has characteristics of both common stock and bonds. It occupies an intermediate space between the two in terms of its risk and returns.\nFloating Stock\nFloating stock, is the number of shares of stock a company has that are actively being traded by the public. It is generally referred to as “float.”\nSecondary Offering\nA secondary offering can refer to when a major investor sells their stock on the public market or when a company issues additional stock after its IPO. The former just puts more shares onto the market, while the latter creates more overall shares to raise additional funds for the company.\nFractional Share\nA fractional share is ownership of a portion of a single share of stock. This allows investors to buy stocks even if the price of their individual shares is extremely high, such as is the case with companies like Berkshire Hathaway.\nEquity Compensation\nEquity compensation is when employees of a company are paid stock, stock options, or a similar type of investment. By tying the employee’s compensation to the stock price, they are meant to encourage the employee to work to maximize shareholder value.\nMeme Stock\nA meme stock is broadly any stock that has gained substantial popularity and investment online through social media. The term was popularized after investment in retailer Gamestop was driven through popularity on the r/wallstreetbets subreddit.\nInitial Public Offering (IPO) Lock-Up\nAn IPO lock-up is a contractually specified period prohibiting large shareholders from selling their shares for a specified period of time after a company has its IPO. Lock-up periods are meant to stop major shareholders from selling large numbers of shares early on and pushing down the stock price early on.\nExplore Stocks\nTop 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 By Index Weight For November 2024\nGuide to Selecting the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nSemiconductors and Advancements Investors Should Watch Out For\nFood Insecurity and Its Impact on the Stock Market\nComparing Mid-Cap Indexes\nWhat Are Meme Stocks, and Are They Real Investments?\nHow to Give Stocks As a Holiday Gift\nApple's 5 Most Profitable Lines of Business\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Definition and History\nDoes Prime Day Impact Amazon's Stock (AMZN)?\nBest Undervalued Stocks for November 2024\nBest AI Stocks for November 2024\nMagnificent 7 Stocks: What You Need to Know\nHow to Rebalance Your Portfolio\nNasdaq’s AI Order Type (Dynamic M-ELO): What to Know \nIndex Rebalancing: What Every Investor Should Know\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares on Webull\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares on Fidelity Investments\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares\nHow to Automate Your Investing\nHow to Invest in Web 3.0\nBy\nGloria Chinemerem Chimelu\nUpdated Jun 29, 2023 \nHow Does the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) Work?\nCommon Stock: What It Is, Different Types, vs. Preferred Stock\nWhat Is a Debt/Equity Swap?

  "text": "Investing in cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency Essentials\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAny investor can purchase cryptocurrency from popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, apps such as Cash App, or through brokers. Another popular way to invest in cryptocurrencies is through financial derivatives, such as CME's Bitcoin futures, or through other instruments, such as Bitcoin trusts and Bitcoin ETFs.\nBitcoin is the most well-known digital currency created in January 2009, after the concept was published in a white paper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large are touted to lower transaction fees when compared to traditional online payment methods, and unlike traditional government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority.\nEthereum is a blockchain-based crypto platform that is best known for its digital currency called Ether, or ETH. Ethereum is second in market value only to Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap data. While the maximum number of bitcoins in circulation is limited at 21 million, the amount of Ether that can be created is unlimited, which is one of the main differences that investors should know.\nOne of the first steps to buying cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Bitcoin is to identify a platform for trading the digital currencies. Some of the top platforms including Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Gemini, Binance, and Bitfinex, which all offer Ethereum to buy and sell. Ether is also backed by many Fortune 500 companies, spurring investor interest.\nInvestors looking to add new cryptocurrencies to their portfolios often look for an initial coin offering (ICO), the crypto variation on an initial public offering (IPO). Like an IPO, a company seeking to raise money can create a new coin or service to launch an ICO as a way to raise funds. Investors in turn can buy the initial coin offering to own the new token, but should be aware of potential fraud within the industry, which is monitored by the SEC for potential abuse.\nInvestopedia / Alison Czinkota\nKey Terms\nCryptocurrency ETF\nA cryptocurrency exchange traded fund is an ETF that tracks a single cryptocurrency or a basket of different digital currencies, and has similar benefits to a traditional ETF—including lower cost of ownership and greater diversification. The first cryptocurrency ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, started trading in October 2021.\nBlockchain\nA blockchain is a distributed database that is shared and verified via a computer network. That database makes up the underlying infrastructure of cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, for a decentralized record of transactions.\nBitcoin mining\nBitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by using computers with specialized chips to solve complicated mathematical puzzles. The first so-called miner to solve the puzzle can earn bitcoin rewards by running such programs using systems that use massive amounts of electricity to mine the cryptocurrencies—a process that has come under criticism because the mining process is not considered environmentally friendly.\nDigital currency\nDigital currency is a form of currency that is also popularly known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash, because they only exist in electronic form, versus a physical form such as paper cash or metal coins.\nAltcoins\nAltcoins generally speaking are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. They share characteristics with Bitcoin but are also different in terms of how they are created and verified. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin and Ether alone accounted for nearly two thirds of the total cryptocurrency market, with altcoins making up the rest.\nHot wallet\nA hot wallet is a cryptocurrency storage application that is always connected to your computer and cryptocurrency network, and as such they tend to be more vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches and theft than so-called cold storage methods. Hot wallets are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and manage tokens you possess. Hot wallets are linked with public and private keys that serve as security measures.\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\nDecentralized finance, also known as DeFi, uses new technology to remove third parties such as banks and other traditional financial institutions in financial transactions. By removing centralized control by banks and other institutions over money, financial products, and financial services, the new financial applications may lower related maintenance costs and fees charged by banks—and also increase the speed of such services.\nVirtual currency\nA virtual currency is a digital representation of value only available in electronic form, and is also known as digital currency. Such cryptocurrencies can be issued by private organizations or companies and its benefits over hard currencies include fast transaction speeds and ease of use.\nExplore Cryptocurrency\nWhat Is Regenerative Finance (ReFi)?\nHow to Store Cryptocurrency\nBy\nGloria Chinemerem Chimelu\nUpdated Sep 01, 2024 \nHow to Create a Crypto Wallet\nHow to Buy SafeMoon Crypto\nHow to Buy Metaverse Crypto\nBitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the 10,000 BTC Pizza Order\nWhat Is the FSB Report on Crypto Regulations?\n10 Crypto Influencers You Should Be Following\nPros and Cons of Investing in NFTs\nNFTs and the Environment: What You Need to Know\nNon-Fungible Token (NFT): What It Means and How It Works\nCrypto Tokens vs. Cryptocurrencies vs. Crypto Commodities: What's the Difference?\nExplaining the Crypto in Cryptocurrency\nHow Cryptocurrencies Impact Estate Planning\nHow Do Cryptocurrency Mining Pools Work?\nWhat's the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency?\nWhat Does Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Mean in Crypto?\nHODL: The Cryptocurrency Strategy of \"Hold on for Dear Life\" Explained\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency Cold Storage and Which Method Is Safest?\nThe 5 Most Private Cryptocurrencies\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Definition, Purpose, and Example\nHow to Give Cryptocurrency As a Gift\nHow to Give NFTs as a Gift\nCryptocurrency Hard Forks vs. Airdrops: What's the Difference?\nMining Pool: Definition, How It Works, Methods, and Benefits\nCryptocurrency Explained With Pros and Cons for Investment\nAxie Infinity: What It Is and How It Works\nWhat Are Crypto Tokens, and How Do They Work?\nWhat Is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)?\nWhy Is Cryptocurrency Trading Popular In South Korea? \nGPU Usage in Cryptocurrency Mining\nWhat Are Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges?\nWhat Are the Legal Risks to Cryptocurrency Investors?\nDigital Money: What It Is, How It Works, Types, and Examples\nCrypto Regulatory Sandbox: What It is, How It Works\nCryptocurrency Futures: Definition and How They Work on Exchanges\nConvertible Virtual Currency: Meaning, Types, and Example\nCryptographic Hash Functions: Definition and Examples\nWhat Is a Cryptocurrency Public Ledger?

  "text": "Introduction to Investing in Bonds\nIntroduction to Bonds\nFrequently Asked Questions\nTreasury bonds, notes, and bills are all fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. The primary difference between them is their maturity dates and the frequency of interest payments. Treasury bills have the shortest maturities, ranging from four weeks to one year, and they only pay interest when they mature. Treasury notes are issued with maturities ranging from two to 10 years, and pay interest every six months. And Treasury bonds mature in either 20 or 30 years, also paying interest every six months.\nAn inverted yield curve is widely considered one of the most reliable indicators of an impending recession. An inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession since 1955 with only one false alarm. Though the inverted yield curve observed in 2019, which preceded the short recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, should hardly be interpreted as a predictor of that recession.\nBond yields move in the opposite direction of prices because the bond’s coupon rate is fixed but the appeal of that bond and its coupon rate on the secondary market changes with economic conditions. If interest rates rise, bonds issued with lower coupon rates become less attractive to potential buyers, who could get a higher rate of return on a new bond. Subsequently, the bond’s price declines. An investor who buys that bond at a discount will receive coupon payments on the bond’s face value, not its market value, meaning their return will be greater than the official coupon rate. Yields decrease as bond prices rise for the same reason.\nYou can cash in most paper U.S. Savings Bond at a bank or credit union. The exception is Series HH bonds, which were discontinued in 2004. These need to be mailed to Treasury Retail Securities Services with a specific form. Electronic bonds can be cashed in online at Treasury Direct, which will transfer the proceeds to your checking or savings account within a couple of days.\nKey Terms\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are U.S. Treasury securities that are pegged to inflation. They are meant to preserve the purchasing power of the investor’s principal.\nBasis Points\nA basis point is a unit of measurement for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of a percent, or 0.01%.\nRepurchase Agreement (Repo)\nA repurchase agreement (repo) is a short-term borrowing arrangement in which a dealer sells government securities to investors with the guarantee they will buy them back shortly after (usually the next day) at a slightly higher price.\nYield Curve\nA yield curve is a line connecting the yields on bonds of equal credit quality but different maturities as plotted on a graph. The slope of the yield curve signals expectations of future interest rates and economic activity. A normal yield curve slopes upward since bonds with longer maturities usually have higher yields. When the yields on short-term bonds exceed those on long-term debt, the yield curve is said to be inverted.\nDebenture\nA debenture is an unsecured loan certificate representing debt that is backed by creditworthiness rather than assets.\nExplore Bonds\nConvertible Debenture: Definition, Example, Advantages & Risks\nCredit Market: Definition, Types, Example\nStep-Up Bond: Definition, How It Works, Pros & Cons, Example\nCatastrophe Bond (CAT) Meaning, Benefits, Risk, Example\nWhat Is a Sukuk?

So while a traditional ETF may track securities of an index on a 1:1 basis, a a leveraged ETF may target a higher mark for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio.\nMany young or novice investors may have heard about exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds and are wondering which may be the better option. Here are some things to keep in mind when deciding between the two investing options. First, typical mutual funds are actively managed rather than passively tracking an index, which can be an advantage. Many mutual funds also may require a minimum investment, but many brokers now offer commission-free ETFs. Generally speaking, ETFs are more tax-efficient and more liquid than mutual funds, which is also something young investors should weigh.\nExchange traded products are financial instruments that track a benchmark index or a basket of underlying securities that trade on exchanges similar to stocks and bonds that are bought and sold in the open market. Some popular ones include exchange traded notes, exchange traded funds, and other related products.\nA stock exchange traded fund is a financial product that tracks a basket of equities, which is an investing option that helps investors diversify their investments in a specific industry or set of companies, limiting the risk of investing in a single stock. Those funds also offer a more cost-effective way to get exposure to a selection of stocks that track a specific index, industry or category of equities.\nSimilar to a stock ETF, a bond exchange traded fund is a financial product that tracks a basket of debt, which is an investing option that helps investors diversify their investments in a specific industry or set of companies, limiting the risk of investing in a single bond. They can mirror bond mutual funds that have a debt portfolio of various risk profiles, from safer U.S. Treasuries to higher yielding bonds of varying maturities and risk exposure.\nAn inverse exchange traded fund is a derivative product that uses securities tied to a benchmark index to profit from a decline in value of the underlying index. Inverse ETFs are also known as short ETFs or bear ETFs since the strategy involved investing on market declines or short positions in order to profit from the strategy. Inverse ETFs typically have higher fees compared to traditional ETFs, and can lead to losses if investors calculate the market direction incorrectly.\nCryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) track the price performance of cryptocurrencies by investing in a portfolio linked to their instruments. Like other such funds, crypto ETFs trade on regular stock exchanges, and investors can hold them in their standard brokerage accounts.\nKey Terms\nIndex ETF\nAn index ETF is a type of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is designed to mirror a benchmark index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average or Nasdaq 100 that trade on an exchange. Index ETFs are popular because they offer a diversified portfolio for investors.\nSmart Beta ETF\nA smart Beta ETF is a kind of exchange traded fund that follows an index, but it also considers alternative factors in choosing the stocks from the index that include companies that only have certain behaviors or metrics. For example, some of these ETFs may follow a stock index that contains only tech stocks, large companies, or mid-cap stocks.\nQQQQ\nThe original ticker symbol for the Nasdaq 100 Trust is known as QQQQ, an ETF that trades on the Nasdaq exchange. The ETF is known as \"cubes\" or quadruple-Qs\" and offers broad exposure to the tech sector by tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index.\nRegulated Investment Company (RIC)\nA regulated investment company can be any type of investment such as mutual funds, ETFs, and REITS. A so-called RIC must derive a minimum of 90% of its income from capital gains, interest, or dividends earned on investments. It was created in 2010 under the RIC Modernization Act to address changes in the mutual fund industry, when President Obama signed it into law.\niShares\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, is the parent of iShares, which is one of the world's largest and well-known ETF providers, offering more than 800 products worldwide. Founded in 2000, iShares now manages over $2 trillion among its exchange-traded funds.\nSector ETF\nA sector ETF is a financial product that invests in stocks and other securities of a very specific sector such as manufacturing, energy or technology stocks, which allows investors to bet on an entire industry without having risky exposure to a single company or several companies. Some other broad sector categories also may include industrials, utilities, or real estate.\nAuthorized Participant\nAn authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund (ETF). Large banks like Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among some of the most well-known authorized participants.\nDividend ETF\nA dividend ETF is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to invest in a basket of dividend-paying stocks, which is an income-investing strategy that provides income via stocks dividends.\nExplore ETFs\nTreasury ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nAgricultural ETFs: What You Need to Know\nHong Kong ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nHow to Invest Globally Through ETFs\nBrazil ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nCopper ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nGold ETFs and Gold Mining ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nPlatinum ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nETF vs. Investment Trust: What’s the Difference?\nHow an Ether Futures ETF Works\nHow Ether Futures ETFs Work and How To Invest\nThe Pros and Cons of Crypto ETFs: What You Need to Know\nWhat Is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF?\nHow to Give an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) As a Gift\nSingle-Stock ETFs: What You Need to Know\nWhat Are Custom Basket ETFs?\nPut $10,000 in the S&P 500 ETF and Wait 20 Years\nHow To Invest in the S&P 500\n2 ETFs To Invest in the Gambling Industry\nETFs vs. Index Mutual Funds: What's the Difference?\nRegulated Investment Company (RIC): Definition, Examples, Taxes\nIntroduction to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of ETFs\nAdvantages of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)\nTracking Error: Definition, Factors That Affect It, and Example\nBuilding an All-ETF Portfolio\nDissecting Leveraged ETF Returns: Explanation, Components, and Examples \nHow To Use a VIX ETF in Your Portfolio\nLeveraged ETFs: The Potential for Big Gains—and Bigger Losses\nHow Are ETF Fees Deducted?\neSports ETFs Seeking to Win Over Investors\nTarget-Date Funds: Advantages and Disadvantages\nHow to Choose an S&P 500 ETF\nSpot Ether ETFs: A Comprehensive Guide\nTIPS ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs: Everything You Need to Know\nWhy Are My Bond ETFs Losing Money, and What Should I Do?\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares on Webull\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares on Fidelity Investments\nHow to Invest in Commodities\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares\nHow to Automate Your Investing\nBest Ways to Earn Passive Income\nThe Vegan ETF - All About How the VEGN Fund Works\nHow Do ETF Dividends Work?\nETFs for the Driverless Car Revolution \nPreferred Stock ETFs vs. Bond ETFs: What's the Difference?\nHow to Navigate the Complex Landscape of ETF Discounts and Premiums\nBitcoin Futures ETF: Definition, How It Works, and How to Invest\nWhat Common ETFs Track the Banking Sector?\nHow Do Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Work?\nHow Do You Calculate the Excess Return of an ETF or Indexed Mutual Fund?\nThe Rise of the Computer-Built ETF\nInvesting",

  "text": "Best 1-Year CD Rates for November 2024: Up to 5.00%\nThe best 1-year CD rate right now is 5.00% APY from Apple Federal Credit Union—2.7 times the national average rate for a 12-month CD. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Nov. 1, 2024.1 \n\"For savers or households with extra cash on hand, 2024 may be the last year we will see CD rates north of 5.00% for the foreseeable future,\" Investopedia Editor-in-Chief Caleb Silver said. \"The Federal Reserve has indicated through its most recent dot plot that interest rates are likely to be between 4.00% and 5.00% in 2025, and then as low as 3.00% to 4.00% in 2026.\"\nBelow are the top CD rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere.\nIn the News\nThe Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18 meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means CD rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years.234\nTo find you the best 1-year CD rates nationwide, we review CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every business day. Investopedia has been tracking CD rates since 2019. We look at factors that help readers choose the best CD, like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. CDs with terms of 10 to 14 months and minimum deposit requirements of up to $25,000 are eligible for our 1-year rankings.\nIn cases where more than one institution pays the same annual percentage yield (APY), we've prioritized CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring a smaller minimum deposit, and if still a tie, alphabetically by institution name.\nBest 1-Year CD Rates \nApple Federal Credit Union – 5.00% APY*\nExpedition Credit Union – 4.80% APY\nDigital Federal Credit Union – 4.75% APY\nAbound Credit Union – 4.75% APY\nQuorum Federal Credit Union – 4.75% APY\nVibrant Credit Union – 4.75% APY\nSignature Federal Credit Union – 4.65% APY\n3Rivers Federal Credit Union – 4.60% APY\nMapleMark Bank – 4.60% APY\nGrow Financial Federal Credit Union – 4.59% APY\nGTE Financial – 4.59% APY\nAlabama Credit Union – 4.57% APY\nPacific National Bank – 4.55% APY\nNewtek Bank – 4.55% APY\nAll In Credit Union – 4.54% APY\nThe CDs in this list may be a good fit if you're looking to reach a short-term savings or investment goal. If a 1-year CD is too much of a commitment though, you can always consider the best CD rates now for shorter terms or even a top-paying high-yield savings account.\nWhy You Can Trust Our Recommendations for the Best 1-Year CD Rates \nInvestopedia collects thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking CD rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best CD, like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. \nInvestopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. Back in 2019 when we first started tracking CD rates, the highest rate on a 1-year CD was 2.60%. Over the years, we've seen CD rates decrease and then increase again to the levels they are at now in 2024. The top 1-year CD rate today is over 2x what the top rate was when we started writing about the best CD rates in 2019. \nThe CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three times the national average. To be eligible for our 1-year CD rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor). Terms of 10 to 14 months are included in our 1-year CD rankings. \nApple Federal Credit Union – 5.00% APY* \nTerm (months): 12\nMinimum deposit: $500\nEarly withdrawal penalty: All earned interest up to 3 months\nOverview: Anyone can join Apple Federal by signing up for a $20 membership in the Northern Virginia Athletic Directors, Administrators, and Coaches Association, as well as keeping at least $5 in a savings account.

In exchange for the high rate, you must keep your funds locked up for about 10 to 14 months. This may be good for your short-term savings since you can access the money by next year. \nThe reason banks and credit unions are willing to pay higher rates on 1-year CDs is because they can generally count on those funds staying in the account, unlike funds that can unpredictably come and go in a savings, money market, or checking account. \nBanks and credit unions offer CDs in a variety of terms, from 1 month up to 10 years, so you can choose how long you're willing to lock up your funds. The most common CD terms, however, range from 6 months to 5 years, with 1-year certificates being the most widely available of all. \nThe date your CD ends is called its maturity date, and although it’s not impossible to withdraw your funds before maturity, you’ll incur a financial penalty if you do so. \nFast Fact\nWhen asked in September where they are investing their money, 13% of Investopedia readers said they are putting more into CDs, behind ETFs, individual stocks, index funds, and money market funds.\nIs a 1-Year CD Right for You?\n\"We got two 1-year CDs because the interest rates were better than what we were earning on our savings accounts. It was very simple to sign up and only took a few minutes at the bank. The timeframe for the CD was good; short-term worked for us in case we need the money. The rate was definitely better than our savings rate too, and we'll most likely roll them over when the time comes,\" said Helen Koby, a retired New Jersey resident who opened two 1-year CDs with her husband in 2023.\nPros and Cons of the Best 1-Year CDs\nPros\nFixed rate for a full year\nHigher APY than liquid accounts\nPredictable earnings and date of withdrawal\nExtremely safe account\nHelps deter spending\nCons\nWithdraw early and pay a penalty\nCan't add to deposit\nIf rates rise, you may miss out\nIf rates drop, you may wish you had a longer-term CD\nPros Explained \nFixed interest rate for a full year: Once you open a CD, you lock in the rate you’ll receive for the full term, no matter what the Federal Reserve does or how other interest rates move. This is a big advantage if rates are predicted to fall, and it can help you stay on track toward your short-term savings goals.\nHigher APY than liquid accounts: Banks and credit unions are willing to pay higher rates on CDs, where they know the money will stay put, than on savings, money market, and checking accounts, where you can withdraw funds more often. \nFully predictable earnings and date of withdrawal: Since a CD’s rate and term are fixed, you know exactly when you’ll be able to withdraw the funds and exactly how much interest you’ll have earned by that date. \nExtremely safe, with almost no risk: When you open a CD at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, you are federally protected on up to $250,000 in deposits, even if the institution fails.2021\nHelps deter spending: If you find it hard not to dip into your savings, the early withdrawal penalty on CDs can serve as a useful roadblock to unwanted spending.\nCons Explained \nEarly withdrawal of the funds will incur a penalty: If you find you need the funds in your CD sooner than the maturity date, you’ll be hit with an early withdrawal penalty that will reduce your earnings.\nYou can’t add to your deposit: Once you decide on your initial deposit amount for a CD, that’s a final decision. You cannot make additional deposits or add money.\nIf rates rise, you may miss out on a higher rate: If rates go up while you own your CD, it means you may have been able to score a higher rate if you had locked in later.\nIf rates drop, you may wish you’d chosen a longer CD: Alternatively, if rates begin declining, you may regret not locking in your great rate for a much longer duration.\nTip\nBe sure to carefully review the terms of your prospective CD before signing off on it and funding the account. But if you find you've changed your mind about the CD within the first few days of opening it, some banks offer a grace period enabling you to quickly exit penalty-free.\nHow Much Money Does $1,000 Make in a Top-Paying 1-Year CD?\nThe amount of money in interest that a $1,000 deposit can make in a 1-year CD will depend on the interest rate. Below are three different scenarios based on three different interest rates you could get on a 1-year CD: \nThe higher your deposit, the higher the interest you will earn from a CD. If you had $10,000 to deposit in a 1-year CD with these same rates, you could earn between $460 and $500 in interest in one year (as long as you do not withdraw your money early). \nHow to Find the Best 1-Year CD\nShop around to learn where the highest 1-year CD rates are offered. You may find CD options at banks, credit unions, or even brokerage accounts.\nThe best 1-year CD for you will be where you feel most comfortable stashing your cash and leaving it for 12 months. While 12 months can feel like a long time, it may help you reach your short-term savings goals faster.\nLook at the early withdrawal penalty. If you need the money sooner than the term's end, you'll likely pay this penalty (though there are some CDs with no penalties).\nCompare your options, review the terms, and then deposit the money to start earning interest.\nHow to Open a 1-Year CD\nOpening a CD is generally no more difficult than opening a savings or checking account. Follow these steps—almost all of the certificates in our rankings of the top nationally available CD rates can be opened online within 10 or 15 minutes. \nProvide personal information and identify yourself via the application—online or in person.\nSpecify how you’ll fund the new CD. The most common approach is with an electronic transfer from another financial institution. However, options to send a check or wire money may be available, depending on the institution.\nRead the written terms of your CD agreement, which will stipulate the interest rate you'll be paid, the date of the CD's maturity, the frequency with which your interest will be paid and compounded, and the specific penalty calculation that will be used if you request to withdraw your funds before maturity.\nImportant\nIf you are funding the new certificate with a very large deposit, you’ll want to check with the institution on any external transfer limits that could be an obstacle. \nOnce your CD is open and funded, it's generally a \"set it and forget it\" product. You'll receive monthly or quarterly statements showing your certificate's growth, but hopefully, you can leave the funds untouched until the maturity date rolls around. \nAlthough the bank or credit union will notify you in advance of the CD maturing, it's wise to set a calendar reminder for yourself so you can be ready with a decision on what to do with the funds when the CD expires. \nWhen Is the Best Time to Get a 1-Year CD?\nThe best time to get a 1-year CD is right before interest rates drop. There's no easy way to know when that will happen, though, so you'll have to decide when the time is right for you. \nFor example, if the 1-year CD you're planning to open has a rate of 5.50% APY right now, and you believe the Fed will lower the fed funds rate in the next month or two, then now might be the best time to get that CD. That's because CD rates typically follow the fed funds rate, so if the Fed lowers rates, your choice of 1-year CD could also see its rate fall. \nOf course, the best time to get a CD will also depend on your situation—you may need to have a certain amount for the deposit, as well. \nNote\nThe national average interest rate for a 1-year CD is 1.81% APY, according to the FDIC. The best CD rates nationwide are nearly three times higher, so be sure to shop around to find the best CD rate and institution for you.22\nCD Rates From Big Banks and Credit Unions\nSome of the biggest banks and credit unions—like the ones you may see commercials for on TV—don't offer the highest CD rates. When choosing a CD, we always recommend looking for one with a high interest rate, a minimum deposit that you can afford, and a term that works for your timeline. If one of the top nationwide CD rates doesn't meet your needs, you can always look at a big-name bank or credit union. You may already have a relationship with one of these institutions, making opening a CD easy. Here are a few banks and credit unions you may want to explore: \nCitibank CD Rates\nU.S. Bank CD Rates\nChase Bank CD Rates\nBank of America CD Rates\nNavy Federal CD Rates\nCapital One CD Rates\nWells Fargo CD Rates\nTD Bank CD Rates\nPNC Bank CD Rates\nCharles Schwab CD Rates\nPenFed CD Rates\nAlternatives to a 1-Year CD \nA 1-year CD won’t be the best savings option in all cases, of course. Fortunately, there is no shortage of alternatives, depending on your situation: \nLonger-Term CDs \nIf you can leave your funds untouched for longer than a year, it’s worth shopping the longer CD terms, such as 18-month, 2-year, or 3-year. You may be able to score a higher rate on one of those CDs. Or you may want to opt for a CD rate that’s not quite as high, but that will last further into the future. \nShorter-Term CDs \nIf you want to move some of your money from regular savings into a CD, but you just don’t feel comfortable with the year-long commitment, 3-month and 6-month CD terms are available from most banks and credit unions that sell CDs. \nSavings Accounts\nIf a 1-year CD isn't right for you, a savings account may be an option. But don't just open any savings account—a high-yield savings account that pays a competitive interest rate is best. While you may not be able to earn as much as the highest rate on a 1-year CD, you will still earn more than you would in a traditional savings account. Plus, the money is accessible whenever you need it (up to certain limits per month, so check with your institution). \nMoney Market Accounts \nAnother option is a money market account, which acts like a savings account, but allows check-writing privileges. Money market accounts also pay high interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts and allow more flexibility with withdrawals than a CD. \nNote\nRemember that the interest rates on liquid accounts, like savings and money market accounts, can change at any time.\nInvesting and Brokerage Accounts\nInvesting accounts can help you save and invest money in stocks, bonds, ETFs, index funds, and more. However, when you invest money like this, usually with a brokerage, it's not as easy to withdraw it if you should need it. \nWhile CDs also come with early withdrawal penalties and taxes on the earnings, investing accounts work differently. If you sell investments you may be selling them for more or less than you bought them for. You may have to pay capital gains taxes, which vary depending on how long you invested the money.23 It may take a few days to get your money from the broker and into your bank account. \nWith a CD, you know exactly when you get the money back after the term ends. You may also be able to open a CD right at your current bank or credit union. You'll also be taxed on the CD's earnings, but it's taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains taxes.24 \nNote\nSome brokerage and robo-advisor accounts also offer cash management accounts that pay high interest rates and can house your uninvested cash, much like a savings account.\nI Bonds \nThese U.S. government bonds are designed to protect your savings against inflation, hence the name I bonds. But while they sometimes pay rates much better than CDs, sometimes the rate is inferior. Also, you absolutely cannot withdraw your funds until one year passes, not even with a penalty.25 For example, I bonds issued between May 1, 2024, and Oct. 31, 2024, the interest rate is 4.28%. That's down from 5.27%, which is what I bonds issued between Nov. 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024 paid.26 \nU.S. Treasuries \nThese allow you to lend money to the U.S. government for a fixed amount of time. Considered one of the safest investments in the world, a T-Bill is a note with a duration of up to 1 year.27 \nBond Funds \nThough it is difficult to research individual bonds, such as corporate offerings, you can easily invest in a bond mutual fund or ETF, which is diversified across many different bond issues. You can also enter and exit the fund at any time. \nMoney Market Funds or Cash Reserve Accounts \nIf you have a brokerage account, you can also hold savings in the brokerage’s cash reserve account or their money market fund. Just be sure to research what rate you’ll earn because in many cases, it will be far less than what you can earn in an outside CD, savings account, or money market account.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan You Get 6% on a 1-Year CD?\nYou may be able to get a 6% interest rate or higher on a 1-year CD that is offered by a local or regional bank or credit union. Right now, though, there are no 6% CDs offered nationwide. With higher rates, there are often more rules such as minimum deposit requirements, specific terms, or large penalties. For our list of the best 1-year CD rates, we rank CDs that are available nationwide and do not have a minimum deposit of more than $25,000.\nWhat Is the Best Place to Open a 1-Year CD?\nThe best place to open a CD will be a bank or credit union that pays the highest rates. These may differ from the big bank you work with for your checking account. In fact, some of the biggest banks pay among the worst rates. In contrast, smaller brick-and-mortar banks, online-only banks, and credit unions tend to offer substantially higher returns. Our daily rankings of the best CD rates is an easy way to find the top nationwide rates.\nYou may also wonder about the inconvenience of having your funds at more than one bank. With CDs, however, this is not a big deal since you won’t be regularly interacting with your CD account. Even with a savings or money market account, internet transfers between institutions are easy these days. But you won’t be making transfers to or from your CD account until you cash out.\nAre 1-Year CDs a Good Short-Term Investment?\nA 1-year CD will be a good short-term investment for you if you can deposit money and leave it untouched for 10 to 14 months. If so, finding a 1-year CD with a high interest rate can offer returns of 5.00% or more. For example, if you deposit $5,000 in a 1-year CD (12 months) with a 5.00% APY, you'd earn $250 by the end of the term. If you need the money sooner than that, consider a 6-month CD.\nShould You Consider Short-Term or Long-Term CDs?\nAnyone looking to reach a savings or investment goal should consider both short-term and long-term CDs. Short-term CDs, like 3-, 6-, or 12-month CDs may help you stay on track toward your goal by locking up your money for a period of time and then earning you interest at the maturity date. This could help prevent you from spending that money since it's locked up for a short time. Long-term CDs may also fit into your savings strategy if you want to lock in a high CD rate now before rates drop in the future. To make the most of short-term and long-term CDs, consider a CD ladder.\nWhat If I Need to Withdraw My Money Early From My 1-Year CD?\nEarly withdrawal penalties, or EWPs, differ greatly among banks and credit unions. For a one-year term, the most common EWP is three or six months' worth of interest. What that means is, if you cash in your CD before its maturity date, the funds returned to you will be docked by the amount of interest the CD would have earned in three or six months.\nBut don't assume all EWPs are similar, or even reasonable. You may find one that charges a whole year's worth of interest, while another assesses a mild 30 days' interest. Still others have more complicated or onerous policies that can even eat into your principal. That's why due diligence is critical before funding any CD. You want to be sure you understand what you're signing up for. And when two choices are relatively equal, choose the CD with the milder penalty.\nAre 1-Year CDs Safe?\nCDs are safe because they are usually insured by the FDIC or NCUA when they are opened at a bank or credit union. If you open a CD at a brokerage, check to see what type of insurance the account has. As with other bank accounts, your money at a bank or credit union is insured for up to $250,000 (across all your accounts at that institution). Each time you open an account at a new bank or credit union, your money at that institution is insured for up to $250,000 as well.20\nAre 1-Year CDs From Smaller Banks and Credit Unions Trustworthy?\nSmaller banks and credit unions are trustworthy. Just like CDs from big banks, these institutions are often insured by the FDIC or the NCUA, so your money is safe up to $250,000.20 A 1-year CD from one of these smaller institutions may pay more than a large bank or credit union, too. This is often because the bigger institutions don't need to pay high rates to lure new customers, while the smaller banks and credit unions do.\nCan You Lose Money on a 1-Year CD?\nGenerally speaking, you can't lose the money you deposit in a 1-year CD if you only withdraw it when the term has matured, or there's no penalty. Most CD accounts are also insured by the FDIC or NCUA, so your money is safe if it's at a bank or credit union with this insurance. The only time you can \"lose\" money on a 1-year CD is if you withdraw it early and there's a penalty, such as the loss of one month's worth of interest. But in that case, you'd only lose interest, not your initial principal payment.\nFinancial Institutions We Review\nWe researched and reviewed over 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

CD Rates \nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000. \nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

Fidelity is a repeat winner in this category, after earning the top spot from Charles Schwab in 2023.\nBest for Low Costs \nFidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lower fees, and its transparent and compelling fee schedule is the reason why—for the third year running—it wins for low costs. \nBest for Cash Management \nFinding the best brokerage account for cash management is not just about earning the highest interest rate possible. It’s also about seamless integration with critical, no-fee banking features and industry-leading insurance. In these areas, Fidelity’s cash management offering is unmatched, and it comes with solid passive earnings power on uninvested cash, along with reimbursable access to a global network of ATMs. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nNo payment for order flow (PFOF) makes for excellent order execution\nStrong portfolio analysis and account features\nSuperior trading platforms for all types of investors\nTop-tier educational content, screening tools, and research capabilities\nFDIC insurance up to $5 million on uninvested cash\nCons\nOnly three digital coins available for trading\nMinimum balance required for some index trading\nMultiple platforms may be required to access all tools\nOn Oct. 9, 2024, Fidelity Investments notified customers that that over 77,000 customers had personal information compromised during an August data breach, including Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses. In a notice to affected customers, the company stated \"Between August 17 and August 19, a third party accessed and obtained certain information without\nauthorization using two customer accounts that they had recently established. We detected this activity on August 19 and immediately took steps to terminate the access. An investigation was promptly launched with assistance from external security experts. The information obtained by the third party related to a small subset of our customers. Please note that this incident did not involve any access to your Fidelity account(s).\"1\nOverview \nIn an industry full of innovative companies competing for the attention of an incredibly diverse universe of traders and investors, Fidelity delivers the most well-rounded product offering to suit the needs of nearly every investor. Headquartered in Boston, Fidelity’s storied history began with its founding in 1946. With $5.5 trillion in discretionary assets as of June 30, 2024, the company ranks among the top brokerage firms in terms of assets under management.2 \nInvestopedia began evaluating online brokerages in 2019, and Fidelity has shown a commitment to improving its financial products and services ever since. Improvements in financial advisor support, bond liquidity analysis, and the new Fidelity Youth app were the highlights of our 2024 product demonstration with the company. In fact, of the 38.7 million brokerage accounts that Fidelity services, 43% of those accounts were opened by investors 18 to 35 years of age.3 But the improvements didn't stop there. Fidelity now also has a comprehensive cash management product that is jam-packed with banking features. \nFidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, and it has a stellar reputation as a broker with a huge customer service network, including 210 customer centers, supporting its low-cost, high-value offering. Investors looking for an online broker that keeps costs low, all while delivering some of the most powerful tools in the industry and resisting the common industry practice of collecting PFOF, will be hard-pressed to find a better broker than Fidelity.\nACTUAL USER EXPERIENCE \n\"I moved all of our family’s investment accounts to Fidelity in 2021 for one simple, but valuable, reason: It’s the only brokerage firm that offers every single account type we have, allowing me to house all of our investments under the same roof. We have a lot of different account types—from various retirement and taxable accounts, to an inherited IRA, to 529s and custodial accounts, and even an investable HSA. Before consolidating to Fidelity, I had to log into multiple places to check on our various investments. Now, except for a new workplace 401(k), I have one login that shows me everything on a single screen. And when I need customer support, Fidelity advisors can also view things as a whole. Moving to Fidelity has added a lot of ease and efficiency to my financial life.\" - Sabrina Karl, Staff Writer for Investopedia\nEditor's Note\nIn addition to our review of Fidelity's online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Fidelity Go.\nCharles Schwab: Best for Beginners \nAccount Minimum: $0 \nFees: $0 for stock/ETF trades, $0.65 per contract for options \nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Beginners \nEven before TD Ameritrade’s educational content was incorporated into its ecosystem, Charles Schwab—which acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020—was known as one of the best platforms for new traders and investors. With the integration now complete, Schwab has taken over top ranks in this category, a position previously held by TD Ameritrade for the past two years. Schwab now houses the most comprehensive library of evergreen learning materials, along with seemingly endless coaching programs and regularly scheduled live training events, making it the best for beginner investors.4 \nResearch Insights \n“If you’re a beginner trader, a user-friendly broker platform will be key. It should be easy to navigate and understand, like using a familiar app. Don’t forget about learning! Look for a broker that offers educational resources to help you understand the market and make informed decisions. Many brokers now offer commission-free trades on stocks and ETFs, so be sure to factor that in as you compare costs. Consider fractional shares too! They allow you to invest in smaller portions of expensive stocks or funds, a great way to get started without a huge initial investment.” -Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst\nPros & Cons \nPros\nIndustry-leading educational content\nMultiple user-friendly platforms \nSuperb ETF research and scanners\nOver 400 branches in 45 states \nAccess to the highly regarded thinkorswim® platform\nCons\nRelatively high margin rates\nLow interest earned on uninvested cash\nLacks fractional ETF trading\nNo direct investments in cryptocurrencies\nOverview \nAfter Chuck Schwab and his partners formed First Commander Corporation in April 1971, they later changed the company’s name to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. in 1973.5 Charles Schwab has experienced continuous growth over the years and, in October 2020, completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with full client integration expected to wrap up in May 2024.6 Not only does Schwab provide the right mix of usability, tools, education, and research to cater to its diverse customer base, but it does so across multiple top-tier platforms. As of August 2024, Schwab’s total client assets stood at $9.74 trillion.7 \nWith Schwab’s integration of TD Ameritrade nearly complete, the powerful combination of Schwab’s exceptional lineup of products and services and TD Ameritrade’s powerful capabilities for traders has boosted the company even closer to the top of our comprehensive rating model. One of the most anticipated additions to Schwab's lineup occurred on April 11, 2024, with the company announcing that futures and forex trading, along with a new Portfolio Margin feature, have been made available on its thinkorswim platform.8 Then, on Oct. 30, 2024, the company announced more exciting news when it introduced access to overnight trading in S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100-traded stocks, as well as hundreds of additional exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week (24/5).9 Prospective customers should note, however, that crypto spot trading still isn’t available, but spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are offered. \nEditor's Note\nIn addition to our review of Charles Schwab’s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.\nInteractive Brokers: Best for Advanced Traders, Best for International Trading, Best for Algorithmic Trading, Best for Risk Management, Best for Generating Stock Trading Ideas \nAccount Minimum: $0.00 \nFees: $0.00 commissions for equities/ETFs available on IBKR’s TWS Lite, or low costs scaled by volume for active traders that want access to advanced functionality such as order routing. $0.65 per contract for options on TWS Lite; that is also the base rate for TWS Pro users, with scaled rates based on volume. $0.85 per contract for futures, also scales with volume for TWS Pro users. 0.12%-0.18% on cryptocurrency trades depending on volume with a minimum $1.75 fee per trade. \nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Advanced Traders \nInteractive Brokers’ lineup of advanced analytical tools, trading technology, and breadth of assets is, quite frankly, awe-inspiring. Ongoing enhancements to legacy platforms like the masterfully constructed Trader Workstation (TWS) and the February 2024 addition of the next-generation IBKR desktop offer just a small glimpse into how Interactive Brokers equips advanced traders to capitalize on fundamental dislocations and pricing inefficiencies better than any other platform we reviewed. This is the third straight year Interactive Brokers has earned this award. \nResearch Insights\n“For intraday and advanced traders, speed is everything. Look for a broker with fast execution speeds to ensure your trades go through quickly. In-depth market research is also crucial, so tools and data analysis are important features to consider. Advanced features like algorithmic trading and order routing control can be helpful for active traders looking to automate strategies or optimize order fulfillment. But remember, even the most advanced tools won’t guarantee success—reliability and low costs remain essential for all traders.” -Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst\nBest for International Trading \nSimply put, not one of the 26 online brokerage companies we reviewed comes close to offering the scope of global research capabilities, international trading and support access, and currency-based funding variety that Interactive Brokers offers. That's why, for the third straight year, the company is our top broker for international traders.\nBest for Algorithmic Trading \nAs trading technology continues to advance, so too does the interest in algorithmic trading. Advanced traders will find a powerful lineup of algorithmic trading features in Interactive Brokers’ pre-built algos, a laundry list of API languages, available algorithmic paper trading accounts, and so much more.\nBest for Risk Management \nWith its powerful rebalancing features, robust portfolio and risk analysis tools, nearly boundless opportunities for asset diversification, and available access to licensed brokers, investors will be hard-pressed to find a better platform for managing portfolio risk than Interactive Brokers. \nBest for Generating Stock Trading Ideas \nFor professional and retail traders looking for investing and trading ideas across the vast universe of equities, over short-, intermediate-, and long-term time horizons, Interactive Brokers brings together leading industry research vendors, proprietary search tools, and the industry’s largest universe of investable stocks to provide a nearly endless source of ideas that suit every investing and trading strategy. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nIncreasing availability of beginner-friendly platforms \nSuperior order execution\nIndustry-best selection of contingent orders\nUnparalleled range of investable foreign and domestic assets\nPowerful and highly customizable professional-level functionality\nCons\nIBKR's SmartRouting not available to IBKR Lite clients\nTWS can be difficult to learn\nNo in-platform backtesting\nOften confusing tiered pricing\nOverview \nFounded under the name T.P. & Co. in 1978 by its current chairman, Thomas Peterffy, the company pioneered the use of computers in trading. Eventually, Interactive Brokers Inc. was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer in 1993, and the company has since developed into one of the industry’s most complete online brokerage platforms. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) offers astonishing access to 150 markets in 34 countries and support for its services in 200 countries and territories, all with funding and trading capabilities in up to 27 currencies. Simply put, this is the broadest global coverage in the industry.10As of September 2024, IBKR held just over $515B in client assets.11 \nOne of the first adopters of technology to the financial markets, both algorithmic and active traders have long regarded the company highly for its advanced trading features, highly customizable tools, low margin rates, and alpha-generating capabilities. Investopedia's team of industry experts is constantly delighted by IBKR’s innovative enhancements that just make so much sense from a purist’s perspective. IBKR’s latest product innovation is IBKR Desktop, a next-generation platform that combines a simple user interface with many of the company’s powerful trading solutions. It features innovations like Option Lattice, a graphical options chain display highlighting potential outliers in key metrics, and MultiSort, which enables users to sort data using multiple factors simultaneously.12 \nThis idea of simplicity is really where things have been getting interesting for Interactive Brokers, as the company has committed to making its platforms more accessible to beginners. With notable touches like the expansion of educational content across several platforms, including its entry-level IBKR Lite platform; available fractional investing; and the innovative and helpful Options Wizard tool offered on its user-friendly Global Trader mobile app (as well as other platforms), Interactive Brokers is quickly gaining ground on the industry’s top all-around brokerage platforms. \nEditor's Note:\nIn addition to our review of Interactive Brokers' online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Interactive Advisors.\ntastytrade: Best Broker for Options \nAccount Minimum: $0 \nFees & Commissions: $0 stock trades, $1 to open options trades (capped at $10 per leg), $0 to close \nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Options Trading \nFor the third year in a row, we chose tastytrade as the best options trading platform because of its options pricing structure, which includes options pricing caps that make it the lowest-cost brokerage for high-volume, high-frequency option traders. In addition, tastytrade optimizes tools and content to suit the needs of its options-focused client base. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nCapped commission structure for options\nHighly regarded tools for analyzing and monitoring options trades\nFantastic options-specific content and educational material\nFully customizable trading experience\nFollow Feed feature allows users to follow trades of tastytrade's TV celebrities\nCons\nNo on-platform paper trading support\nFew investing and retirement resources\nLacks some key investment choices like mutual funds\nOverview \nAsk any options trader and they are likely to tell you that this form of derivative trading is complex and difficult to master. But with the right guidance, the many options strategies that are available to use can become powerful weapons that allow both traders and investors to benefit from key factors like time decay and leverage. Created by the same people who developed TD Ameritrade’s highly regarded thinkorswim platform, tastytrade maintains its stance as the best broker for options because of its intuitive delivery of an industry-best mix of comprehensive options-focused tools and content. \nLaunched as tastyworks in 2017 and headquartered in Chicago, tastytrade delivers very competitive fees for options trading, including standout features like commission caps for large lot sizes, as well as the absence of any trade commissions when closing positions. Fortunately for tastytrade users, these low commissions come with a platform that continues to undergo enhancements which complement its already powerful delivery of options analytics, platform workflow, trade execution, and valuable digital content. \nE*TRADE: Best for Mobile Investing & Trading \nAccount Minimum: $0 \nFees: No commission for stock, ETF, and mutual fund trades. Options are $0.50-$0.65 per contract, depending on trading volume. \nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Mobile Investing & Trading \nA pioneer in both mobile and online trading, E*TRADE has mastered the art of developing a mobile experience with the right mix of intuitive navigation, robust portfolio and risk management capabilities, deep research, easy-to-digest education, and complex trading tools to cater to investors and traders of all levels. Ongoing enhancements to E*TRADE's mobile capabilities over the past couple of years have caused it to solidify its position as our best mobile trading and investing platform for the first time ever. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nExcellent range of tools and resources\nPre-built and automated portfolio options\nEducational content library \nTop mobile apps for traders and investors of all levels\nCons\nLacks international exchange trading\nNo direct crypto investing\nFractional shares only available through a robo-advisor portfolio or dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)\nOverview \nSince its founding in 1982, E*TRADE has been at the forefront of embracing innovation that makes for one of the best customer experiences in the industry. Following Morgan Stanley’s acquisition of E*TRADE in 2020, the company has only continued to advance its capabilities by integrating many of Morgan Stanley’s highly regarded research materials, thought leadership insights, and large pool of financial advisors. \nAs one of the largest online brokers in the country, E*TRADE brings an expansive list of investment choices and trading tools to its customer base of 8.2 million households via its website, desktop, and two mobile platforms.13 E*TRADE’s already vast educational catalog has only grown with the Morgan Stanley integration, complementing the intuitive site design in a way that lets new investors enter the market with confidence. For more experienced investors, the ability to do deep analysis has never been greater than now, when proprietary Morgan Stanley research joins highly regarded third-party research and consensus ratings. While E*TRADE only offers these more advanced traders exposure to cryptocurrencies via Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs and related stocks, traders have access to a wide array of analysis tools, charting functionality, and trading technology to make the most informed decisions in this and many other asset classes. \nEditor's note\nIn addition to our review of E*TRADE’s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, E*TRADE Core Portfolios.\neToro: Best for Social Cryptocurrency Trading \nAccount Minimum: $50-$200 minimum deposit for most regions, $200 minimum per trader for copy trading features, $500 minimum investment for Portfolio \nFees: 1% crypto trading fee plus market spread; no-fee stock, ETF, and options trading ($1-$2 per trade fee in select few countries), plus market spread; 2% crypto asset transfer fee \nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Social Cryptocurrency Trading \nIn addition to being a user-friendly, multi-asset brokerage platform, eToro shines for its unique social investing feature that enables users to copy other traders’ trades, or receive exclusive perks for sharing their own trading strategies. \nWhat You Need to Know\nOn September 12, 2024, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that eToro is ceasing trading for nearly all crypto assets. The announcement comes after eToro reached a settlement with the SEC for charges that the trading platform operated an unregistered brokerage and clearing agency related to its crypto dealings. eToro has also agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle with the SEC, in addition to limiting its cryptocurrency offering to just Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether for U.S. consumers. U.S. customers holding cryptocurrency no longer offered by eToro will be able to sell their cryptocurrency for up to 180 days.14\nPros & Cons \nPros\nEstablished platform available in over 70+ countries\nRelatively large selection of tradable crypto assets\nInnovative and easy-to-use social trading experience\nCons\nOnly available in 47 states\nVery limited account types\nGeneral lack of advanced trading tools, features, and research\nNo margin trading in the U.S.\nOptions trading only offered to U.S. and U.K. residents via a separate app\nOverview \nOriginally developed with a focus on forex trading in 2007, eToro eventually transformed and in 2010 created one of the first social trading experiences, called OpenBook.15 Since then, the company has enhanced this means of enabling users to learn from and copy other seasoned traders across popular asset classes like stocks, ETFs, futures, and crypto. Currently, eToro is only available in 47 U.S. states, but its 25 million-plus users can also find support in more than 70+ countries around the world.16 \neToro recently upgraded its charting capability with the addition of Tradingview’s Pro charts, but the platform still lacks many of the tools, calculators, and detailed order types beyond basic market and limit orders that most sophisticated investors would find necessary to carry out advanced trading techniques. eToro provides real-time pricing information for 3 cryptocurrencies, over 3,000 stocks, and more than 270 ETFs, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, covering the most important assets and securities.171819 eToro’s crypto wallet is a separate omnibus wallet with its own address. Users can’t bring in their existing crypto, but they can buy and store it with eToro’s wallet. Additionally, there is no staking available in eToro wallet.20 \nWhile eToro recently added options trading to its asset mix, this functionality is currently offered to U.S. customers via a separate app. However, during our live demonstration with eToro we learned that options trading is currently being piloted in the U.K. and will soon be made available on the main app.\nPublic: Best for Alternative Investments \nAccount Minimum: $0 \nFees: $0 stocks and ETFs; fees of at least $0.49 and up to 1.25% of the order amount apply for crypto trading; Public Premium: $8/month, free with $50K+ account balance \nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Alternative Investments \nPublic offers an easy-to-use platform with social networking features, fractional investment capabilities, and a creative selection of alternative investment options. In addition to stock, option, ETF, and cryptocurrency trading, Public provides a platform for purchasing Treasury bills and alternative investments, like rare sneakers, trading cards, royalties, and more.21\nWhile Public is our best brokerage for alternative investments and offers a novel mix of alternative investments, it’s important to know that many of these investments are highly illiquid and speculative. That means it may be difficult to buy and sell assets with ease.\nPros & Cons \nPros\nAvailable fractional share investing\nA social media element that connects investors\nEasy-to-use mobile app\nNo payment for order flow on stocks and ETFs\nHigh interest earned on uninvested cash\nCons\nVery limited account types\nIlliquid and expensive alternative investments\nBasic educational material\nLimited features\nOne-leg options strategies only \nOverview \nEstablished in 2019 by Jannick Malling and Leif Abraham, Public offers mobile and web browser-based trading best suited for investors interested in a unique set of alternative assets. The New York-headquartered company is a regulated broker-dealer, with Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) protection in each account up to $500,000.22 \nPublic was developed to help lower the barrier to entry for those who shy away from investing due to a lack of financial literacy, as well as those who lack the means to acquire positions in many expensive financial products. The company has certainly succeeded on this front with its clean and simple user experience; commission trading of stocks, ETFs, and options; $0 account minimum; fractional investing; and social networking element. \nHowever, the platform is not without its faults. To begin with, many of the alternative investments offered on the platform are highly illiquid and speculative, and come with high transaction costs. Next, Public does not engage in payment for order flow (PFOF), but it charges an assortment of fees for things like inactivity and instant withdrawals.23 Investors may also be turned off by the fact that Public requires users to manually opt out of tipping on each transaction, which the company calls “a more transparent, more aligned way to make money” than PFOF.24 Lastly, Public currently only offers access to individual brokerage accounts.25\nThe Bottom Line \nThrough our exhaustive research, we found that Fidelity not only outshines the competition when it comes to ETF investing, low costs, and cash management features, but it is also the best online brokerage platform overall. While International Brokers’ ongoing evolution into a more beginner-friendly platform is driving it closer to parity with the industry’s top all-around brokerage platforms, it remains a top choice for advanced trading techniques and risk management, as well as international trading.\nFor traders planning to make options the main strategy they use to reach their investment goals, tastytrade’s platform and market content are hard to beat. Charles Schwab’s integration of TD Ameritrade's educational programs and trading personalities has produced an unparalleled body of actionable learning materials and live training content for beginners.\nE*TRADE’s long history of enhancing the user experience continues to shine through with its fantastic mobile apps, while eToro and Public bring social trading and networking to the next level as part of their top-rated crypto and alternative offerings.\nCompare the Best Online Brokers \nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia collected 89 criteria that are critical to investors, from 26 online brokerage companies. We used this data to review each brokerage platform for fees, usability, research amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best online brokerage accounts since 2019.\nHow to Choose a Brokerage Account \nInvestors choosing an online broker will find a wide range of options, each with varying product offerings, cost structures, and features. The best broker for you will ultimately depend on your individual goals, priorities, and preferences. Some investors may require advanced platforms with access to niche markets and exotic instruments, while others happily settle for a simple, user-friendly mobile app and cost-effective pricing. Whatever your objectives, here are some key factors to consider when choosing an online broker.\nCommissions and fees \nThe commissions and fees your broker charges directly impact your bottom line, and can be a major factor to consider, especially for active traders. Nowadays, with rare exceptions, online brokers offer commission-free stock, ETF, and mutual funds trading, but still charge for options trades. In addition, brokers also generally charge for trading more advanced instruments, like futures, and more exotic asset classes, like cryptocurrencies. \nAvailable assets and instruments \nThe breadth of assets and instruments available to trade determines how flexible your investment portfolio or trading strategies can be. Most online brokers offer trading in stocks, ETFs, and options. A sizable number also provides access to futures and mutual funds. A small, but steadily growing group allows clients to trade cryptocurrencies. \nAdditionally, some brokers now offer fractional shares, which allow investors to buy a portion of high-priced stocks. This feature can be especially helpful for those with smaller accounts, as it makes expensive stocks more accessible. Access to a specific asset class can be a deciding factor when choosing an online broker. \nYour own investing or trading style \nDifferent brokers cater to different trading styles. Whether you manage a long-term stock portfolio, trade complex options strategies, or actively scalp intraday, make sure the platforms and features offered by your broker complement your style and facilitate your trades. \nUser experience \nA well-designed, intuitive platform can make trading easier and more enjoyable for traders of all levels, but especially for beginners. In recent years, many online brokers have invested significant time and money into making the user experience as seamless as possible. Advanced platforms, although improving, may still come with a learning curve due to the amount of instruments and the complexity of tools on offer. \nResearch tools \nResearch tools help investors make better trade decisions. Among others, this may include access to market data, analyst ratings, charting tools, and latest financial reports. Brokers with robust research capabilities may provide traders an edge by offering quicker access to essential market data. \nEducational content \nFor beginners and experienced investors alike, educational resources are a way to continue improving their knowledge and strategies. A broker offering tutorials, webinars, and in-depth guides can help users stay informed and grow their trading expertise. \nOther key features \nOther considerations may include account minimums and benefits, supported order types, customer support accessibility, and premium account offerings. Brokers with zero account minimums are more accessible to new investors, while traders with large account balances may benefit from earning interest on unused cash. \nActive traders will value a broker’s support of complex order types, and those who trade international markets or cryptocurrencies will appreciate the ability to get customer support 24/7. More recently, some brokers also began offering premium accounts - providing additional services or offering better pricing, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. Such accounts may be beneficial to certain investors. \nWhat Is the Difference Between a Full-Service Broker and an Online Broker? \nThis report identifies the best online brokers and trading platforms. It is natural to ask, “How do these brokers and platforms differ from full-service brokers?” One key difference is that online brokers cater to do-it-yourself (DIY) investors. In contrast, full-service brokers aim to relieve you of as much heavy financial lifting as possible by shifting it to their own advisors or affiliated experts. \nWhile online brokers harp on their low costs–not just for trades but also low minimums to open accounts and low costs for access to research, tools, and services–full-service brokers boast of the wide range of their offerings. Those include everything from personal financial planning to insurance, estate planning, retirement planning, accounting services, tax advice, and more. \nStill, the boundary between the two categories of brokers is more and more blurry. Online brokers increasingly offer more services, while full-service brokers increasingly cut costs. In fact, many investors would be hard pressed to explain why some online brokers–especially the larger ones–should not be thought of as full-service firms. \nCertified financial planner Michael Donnelly, who is account director of corporate relations at the CFP Board of Standards, said, “The financial services landscape has dramatically changed over the past 30 years. Firms that once served specific clients now compete to keep pace with broader client needs and lower-cost competitors. [Full]-service and online brokers have had to expand their offerings and cut costs to stay competitive. As a result, investors benefit from more similar and competitively priced products across the financial planning ecosystem.”\nFrequently Asked Questions \nWhat Is an Online Brokerage Account and How Does it Work?\nA brokerage account is a type of account similar in function to the accounts you have with a bank. With a brokerage account, you deposit funds with an investment firm (the brokerage). This is usually done by a transfer from your existing bank account. Once funds are added to your brokerage account, you can put the money to work using the brokerage's trading platform to invest those funds in the market. The assets you buy with your cash can be anything offered by that brokerage, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and even cryptocurrency.\nYour online brokerage account will display your holdings (the assets you've purchased) as well as your cash balance (your buying power). If you invest in something that gains in value, you can sell it and the profits will be deposited in your online brokerage account. From there, you can place another trade or even transfer the funds out to your regular bank account to use elsewhere. Some brokerage accounts even allow you to earn interest on your uninvested cash.\nHow Much Money Do you Need to Open a Brokerage Account?\nThere is no longer a real minimum to start investing in the financial markets. With many brokers offering margin accounts with access to fractional shares and no required minimums, you can open and fund an account with any amount of money. If you don't have a lot of money to invest, however, it will influence how you approach the market. Although you could invest $1 in fractional shares of a specific stock, the better approach with limited capital is to use ETFs. Index tracking ETFs, for example, offer greater diversification for your dollar than a single company stock because every share (and fractional share) of the ETF replicates an index made up of many companies in many different industries. You could also consider using options to leverage your dollars with a directional bet on the market or a specific stock, but this is a strategy best reserved for risk capital—not the whole of your limited investment capital.\nWhen investing with small sums, consistency is the key to building wealth. If you can regularly put a set amount of money into the market—even $10 a week—you will be surprised at how quickly it begins to grow. This consistency also helps to smooth market effects, as you will be buying dips and peaks as the market goes up and down.\nCan You Invest With a Small Amount of Money?\nMany online brokers allow for small minimum deposits which can be a great alternative for those with limited funds. Account minimums (if any) are displayed at the top of our reviews, as well as in our selection of the best platforms for different types of investors. If you are looking for more general guidance on investing with limited capital, check out our article on smart investing on a small budget.\nDo Brokers Offer Mobile Platforms?\nSome online brokers have powerful mobile apps delivering nearly all the features that their desktop counterparts do. For example, E*TRADE's app, which we picked as our best app for mobile investing and trading, offers two mobile platforms that are streamlined versions of the company's powerful desktop platform.\nCan You Lose Money in a Brokerage Account?\nYes, you can. It is a reality of the market that no reward comes without risk. You can lose money buying a bad investment, but you can also lose by buying a good investment at the wrong time. Investment decisions should be guided by extensive research and careful consideration of your risk tolerance. When it comes to the financial markets, there are endless possibilities for making and losing money. Unless all the funds in your brokerage account are sitting in uninvested cash (brokerage cash accounts are afforded up to $250,000 of protection by Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance), there is a risk you will lose money.\nAnother way of looking at that, however, is that a brokerage account sitting full of uninvested cash isn't at risk of making any money either. You can use strategies like asset allocation and diversification to reduce the risk of you losing money, but you will never fully eliminate it without also eliminating your chances of making a decent return.\nCan I Buy Stocks Without a Broker?\nYes, you can actually buy and sell stocks without a broker, but it is not a common approach these days. Some companies still offer direct stock purchase plans that allow you to buy shares directly from the company. Companies administer these plans according to internal rules, and some are only open to company employees. You need to contact companies to find out whether they offer a direct stock purchase plan and what the terms and conditions are. These plans initially helped investors avoid brokerage fees, but the rise of online discount brokers with zero fees has removed this barrier, making the direct stock purchase plan somewhat of a relic.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Investing and Trading?\nAn important thing to consider is the distinction between investing and trading. When people talk about investing they generally mean buying assets to hold long-term. The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth and reach your retirement goals. Conversely, trading involves short-term strategies that maximize returns on a short-term basis, such as daily or monthly. Trading is generally considered riskier than investing.\nAll these factors are worth considering before choosing an online broker. Do you want to trade or invest? Do you want a great mobile app to check your portfolio wherever you are? What types of assets are you looking to invest in? Answering these questions is not always easy. For more support on how to choose a broker, you can check out our guide to choosing a stock broker. Once you've made a decision on a broker, you can refer to our guide to opening a brokerage account.\nInvestopedia's latest Reader Survey shows that, despite concerns about the election, inflation, and extended valuations, individual stocks remain survey respondents' the top investment choice if they had an extra $10,000 to spend.\nCompanies We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed 26 online brokers and trading platforms to find the best companies you see in the list above.

  "text": "Options & Derivatives Trading\nUnderstanding Options & Derivatives Trading\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes, the simplest derivative investment allows individuals to buy or sell what is known as an option on a security. An option is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial product. Various derivative instruments besides options include swaps, futures, and forward contracts. The investor does not own the underlying asset, but they hope to profit by making bets on the direction of price movements spelled out in the contract.\nSimply put, ETF futures and options are derivative instruments tied to exchange traded funds. Futures represent an agreement to buy or sell shares of an underlying ETF at an agreed-upon price on or before a certain date in the future. Options, in contrast, give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to trade the underlying ETF shares at an agreed-upon price on or before a specified date in the future.\nThe actual size of the derivatives market depends on what a person considers part of the market and so estimates vary widely. The entire derivatives market is, simply put, huge, and top estimates can be more than $1 quadrillion on the high end, based on what is included as a derivative. The larger estimates come from adding up the notional value of all available derivatives contracts. For example, the overall derivatives markets include products including options, warrants, swaps, credit default swaps, futures contracts, and forward contracts, as just a handful of examples. Some analysts argue that such a calculation doesn't reflect reality, in that the notional value of a derivative contract's underlying assets does not represent the actual market value.\nA forward contract is a derivatives instrument that is one of the oldest and most common types of derivative securities, in which counterparties agree to buy (receive) or sell (deliver) an asset at a specified price on a future date. They are used as a form of risk management, in that a forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation. They are quite common in foreign exchange markets as a way for investors to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities from various global currency markets.\nETF futures are a kind of financial derivatives product built on existing exchange traded funds. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell shares of an underlying ETF at an agreed-upon price on or before a specified date.\nKey Terms\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC)\nThe Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC) is commonly referred to as Farmer Mac, and was by an act of Congress in 1987 in response to the farm crisis in the United States, which led to thousands of farmers to default on their loans, lose their farms and led to the collapse of many agricultural banks that services the farming industry.\nCboe Options Exchange\nThe Cboe Options Exchange is the world's largest options exchange that was founded in 1973. It was originally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the exchange changed its name in 2017 as part of a rebranding effort by its holding company, CBOE Global Markets, which runs the exchange with contracts focusing on individual equities, indexes, and interest rates.\nWarrant Coverage\nWarrants are similar to options, except that they are issued by a company and dilute overall equity ownership. Warrant coverage is an agreement between a company and shareholders in which the company issues a warrant that is worth some percentage of the dollar amount of their investment. Warrants, also like options, allow investors to acquire shares at an agreed-upon price.\nWarrant Premium\nA warrant premium is the difference between the traded price of a warrant and its minimum value. A warrant's minimum value is the difference between its exercise price and the current traded price of its underlying stock.\nWeather Derivative\nA weather derivative is a financial product that companies or investors can use to hedge risk against weather-related disasters, much like insurance. The seller of a weather derivative agrees to bear the risk of disasters in return for a premium for taking on that risk. If nothing happens before the agreed-upon contract, the seller will profit, but in the event of a weather phenomenon or disaster, the buyer of the derivatives contract will claim the set amount. Various industries such as agriculture or tourism and travel will use these financial products to offset any potential losses from unexpected weather disrupting business.\nFreight Derivatives\nFreight derivatives are financial products that derive their value from various freight agreements and freight rates, such as dry bulk carrying rates, and is used primarily in the shipping and cargo industry to manage the risk of fluctuating levels of freight charges or oil tanker rates changing unexpectedly. The risk management tool has become more in focus as the shipping industry bears the burden of supply-chain shocks and delays as a result of the global pandemic.\nTransaction Risk\nTransaction risk is the risk that an investor or company may take on when currency exchange rate fluctuations may change the value of a foreign transaction after a transaction has been completed but not yet settled, and can also be referred to as exchange rate, or currency risk. Transaction risk takes on greater risk when there is a longer time between when the transaction occurs and when it settles.\nCashless Conversion\nA cashless conversion is when the ownership of some kind of security or asset changes without cash payment by the owner. For example such a conversation may take place if convertible bonds or convertible preferred shares are part of a transaction in which there is a cashless conversion to common stock in the deal. A cashless conversion is typically spelled out in the contract when the deal occurs, and the transfer may happen by an agreed upon trigger event or specific date.\nExplore Options and Derivatives\nImplied Correlation Index: What it Means, How it Works\nHow Companies Use Derivatives To Hedge Risk\nCross-Currency Swap: Definition, How It Works, Uses, and Example\nEuropean Option: Definition, Types, Versus American Options\nSynthetic: Definition in Finance, Types of Assets\nHow to Trade Options on Robinhood\nHow to Trade Options on Webull\nHow to Trade 0DTE Options\nHow to Open a Swing Trade Account\nStructured Investment Products (SIPs): Definition and Examples\nSettlement Price: Definition, Use in Trading, and Example\nPut: What It Is and How It Works in Investing, With Examples\nGlobex: What it is, How it Works, History\nWhat Is Time Decay?

Where more than one institution pays the same top rate, our rankings prioritize CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring the smallest minimum deposit. If there is still a tie, we rank alphabetically by institution name.\nIn the News\nIt's widely expected that the Fed will cut rates again by 25 basis points at its meeting on Nov. 6-7, which could mean lower CD rates are coming, too. At its September meeting, the Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00%. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation.123\nDetailed information on these top-paying nationally available 18-month CDs is provided below, including specifics about minimum deposits and early withdrawal penalties.

You can get a CD from a bank or credit union. An 18-month CD requires you to keep the funds untouched for about a year and a half. For our rankings, we consider 18-month CDs to be anything with a term of 15 to 20 months. \nIn exchange for giving up access to your funds, you'll generally be rewarded with a higher interest rate than the bank pays on savings and money market accounts. \nWhen opening a CD, deposit a lump sum of funds into the account at or above the minimum required deposit for that CD. The funds will sit in the account for about 18 months, earning interest along the way. When the CD hits its maturity date, you can withdraw the funds plus their earned interest from the account with no penalty. \nFast Fact\nWhen asked in September where they are investing their money, 13% of Investopedia readers said they are putting more into CDs, behind ETFs, individual stocks, index funds, and money market funds.\nPros and Cons of 18-Month CDs\nPros\nOffers a guaranteed rate for 18 months: No matter what happens with the Federal Reserve and interest rates, the bank cannot change the APY you secure when you sign your CD agreement and make your deposit.\nMay pay a higher APY than other terms: Shopping around is critical, as rates can vary widely across institutions and also across different CD lengths.\nPays reliable and predictable earnings: Because your CD rate is fixed and your term is known, you can calculate exactly how much your earnings will amount to once the CD matures.\nIs safe and virtually risk-free: CDs opened at an FDIC bank or NCUA credit union are federally insured, protecting up to $250,000 of your deposits in the unlikely event that the institution fails.\nCan deter the temptation to spend since funds are tied up: Withdrawing your funds before the CD matures will trigger an early withdrawal penalty, which may be enough to stop you from pulling the funds out for unplanned spending.\nCons\nIncurs a penalty if you withdraw early: Every bank and credit union specifies their policy on how they'll calculate your penalty if you don't keep your CD funds deposited until maturity. Typically, the penalty is a number of months' interest that you'll forfeit.\nAllows only one deposit amount: With most CDs, you get one chance to decide how much you want to invest in the certificate. Additional deposits are generally not allowed.\nIf rates fall, you may wish you'd opted for a longer term: Investing in a longer CD would have allowed you to retain a good rate for a longer period of time\nIf rates rise, you'll be locked at a lower rate until maturity: If you lock into an 18-month CD and then rates rise, you'll be stuck with your current rate until you can withdraw your funds.\nImportant\nThough consumers tend to think about CD terms in nice round numbers, be sure to consider odd-term CDs, such as 15-month, 18-month, or 21-month certificates. It's not uncommon for promotional rate CDs to have unusual durations, so don't limit yourself to only the conventional terms.\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a CD\nWhen choosing a CD, consider the following factors: \nYour goals: Both short-term financial goals and long-term financial goals are important.\nHow much money you can deposit: CDs have minimums, so if you only have $500 to deposit, you'll need to find a CD with that minimum balance requirement.\nHow long you can leave that money in the CD without touching it: This will help you determine the right term—whether that's a 1-year CD or a 3-year CD.\nInterest rates offered for your term and minimum deposit: The higher the rate, the more you will earn on your deposit during the CD term.\nCD type: Is it a bump-up CD or a regular CD? This will ensure you're choosing one that meets your needs and goals.\nOnce you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest. \nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"The key to choosing the right CD is matching the term length to your needs,\" said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council. \"If you won’t need access to the money for a year or more, consider locking in a higher rate with a longer-term CD.\"\n18-Month CD Penalties and Fees\nAlmost all CDs—not just 18-month CDs—come with an early withdrawal penalty. That means that if you decide to take your money out of the CD before the date the CD matures, you have to pay a fee. The fee is typically in the form of interest you earned, such as three or six months' worth of interest. \nFor example, let's say you deposited $1,000 in an 18-month CD with a 5.00% APY. The total interest you would earn by keeping it in the CD for 18 months is $75.93. If the CD comes with an early withdrawal penalty worth six months of interest, then you would have to pay $25.31 if you decided to take your money out early. \nOther than the early withdrawal penalty, CDs don't typically come with any other fees (though the banking institution may require some). \nHilarey Gould, Senior Editorial Director for Financial Products and Services at Investopedia\nWhen choosing an 18-month CD, be sure to review the early withdrawal penalty. If you think you might need to withdraw your money before the CD matures, look for a CD with a lower penalty so that you end up with the most money possible when you withdraw. If you are positive that you won't touch the money in the CD until maturity, you may feel comfortable opening a CD with a more expensive penalty.\nHow to Find the Best 18-Month CD Rates\nThis list includes the best 18-month CD rates, meaning that they are the highest 18-month CD rates nationwide. To find you the top 18-month CD rates, we look at hundreds of banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions every day and gather the CDs with the highest rates that are available nationwide, including CDs with terms of 15 to 20 months. \nWhen looking for an 18-month CD, consider the amount of money you want to deposit, the interest rate on the CD, and the early withdrawal penalty. For example, if a 20-month CD offers a 5.00% interest rate on a $25,000 deposit, but a 12-month withdrawal penalty, you may want to compare it with a 15-month CD with the same deposit but a six-month withdrawal penalty. \nThis comparison is important to think about because if you need that money back sooner than maturity, you need to know what amount of interest you'll lose by withdrawing early. With that in mind, you'll need to first compare your options based on your deposit amount, then look at the rate and early withdrawal penalty. \nNote\nCD rates are the same for everyone who applies to open a CD. Your credit score and other financial history and experience are not determining factors like they are with credit cards or loans. So even if you have bad credit, you can earn a high interest rate on your savings by locking it up in a CD for a period of time.\nHow to Open an 18-Month CD\nAfter you find the right CD for you, you'll need to apply to open the account. This may be easy if you're already a member of the bank or credit union. If you're not, you may need to open another savings account first, or apply to be a member of the credit union by joining another free or low-cost organization (the American Consumer Council is a popular one). \nTo open an 18-month CD, follow these steps: \nFind the CD you want to open, whether online or in-person at the bank or credit union.\nHave a current membership or relationship with the bank or credit union via an open account like a savings or a checking account, and/or through a non-profit organization (typically only applies to credit unions).\nFill out the application with your name, deposit amount, and other personal info.\nWait for approval.\nFund the CD and let your money earn interest. You may be able to send a check, wire the money, or electronically transfer it, depending on the institution.\nRead the CD's terms. This fine print info will tell you the interest rate you'll be paid, the date of the CD's maturity, how often your interest will be paid and compounded, and the early withdrawal penalty (if any) that you need to pay if you request to withdraw your money before maturity.\nOnce your 18-month CD is opened, it's a set-it-and-forget-it process to earn your interest. \nThere are just two times when you may need to take action on your 18-month CD: \nWhen you need your money back before maturity: You'll likely pay an early withdrawal penalty and will need to withdraw the funds before transferring them into another account. Then the CD will be closed.\nWhen your CD matures: You may need to indicate if you want the CD to roll over into another CD at the institution or if you want the money withdrawn and deposited back into your other account.\nCompare the Best 18-Month CD Rates\nAlternatives to 18-Month CDs\n18-Month CDs vs. Other CD Terms\nInstead of an 18-month CD, you could choose a shorter certificate to limit the amount of time your funds are tied up, but you may have to settle for a slightly lower rate. The same is true if you go with a longer-term CD: rates could be lower than what you can earn in 18 months. It all depends on the current rate environment, so it's important that you shop around. \nFor example, if rates are higher now than you think they will be in the future, locking in one of today's rates for as long as possible can be a smart move. This allows you to retain your APY for longer than if you chose a shorter-term CD. \nCDs vs. Savings and Money Market Accounts\nOpening a top-paying high-yield savings account or a money market account is an alternative option to a CD. These accounts let you earn a competitive return on your funds with more flexibility. The downside is that savings and money market accounts pay a variable rate, which means that if interest rates go down in the future, so will the rate you're earning in these accounts. \nThe same applies to cash reserve and money market funds at brokerage firms. Many of these pay much lower rates than you can earn with a high-yield savings account at a top-paying bank. But even when the APY on a brokerage cash account is competitive, it too is a variable rate that you can't lock in like you can with a CD. \nCDs vs. US Savings Bonds & Treasuries\nYou could alternatively put your funds in U.S. savings bonds or Treasuries. The U.S. government offers two types of savings bonds: EE bonds and I bonds. EE bonds offer a fixed interest rate that you'll know at the time of making your deposit decision, while I bonds offer a rate that changes every six months based on current inflation levels (hence, the name I bonds). These investments are exceptionally safe, but they do not allow a withdrawal within the first 12 months for any reason.\nYou can also lend money to the U.S. government by purchasing Treasury bonds. These are called T-bills for durations of four weeks to one year, and Treasury notes for durations of two to 10 years. Treasuries are considered one of the safest investments in the world, but their rates are not always as high as the best CDs or high-yield savings accounts. \nWhere Are CD Rates Headed in 2024?\nCD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which the Federal Reserve lowered for the first time since 2020 at its September meeting. The rate had held steady at a range of 5.25%–5.50% since July 2023, but it now stands at 4.75%–5.00% and CD rates can be expected to follow suit.1 \nWith rates likely headed lower yet this year, now is the time to lock in a higher CD rate while it is still possible. The Fed's next rate policy meeting is Nov. 6–7, and a survey of committee members after September's meeting showed that further rate cuts can be expected if inflation appears to be under control. In September, the inflation rate was 2.4%, down slightly from August's 2.5% rate.3217\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat Are the Best CD Rates for 18 Months?\nThe best CD rates for an 18-month term will be anything close to 5.00%. The best 18-month CD will come with a high rate, low early withdrawal penalty, and low minimum deposit required. Most of the top 18-month CDs have an early withdrawal penalty of three to six months and a minimum deposit of $500 or more.\nIs an 18-Month CD a Good Investment?\nRight now, an 18-month CD is a good investment because you can earn a high rate on an 18-month CD. Once you open that CD, you are guaranteed that rate until the CD matures (as long as you do not withdraw the money early). Considering the Fed is watching inflation and interest rates closely, there's a chance it could cut the fed funds rate in the next 18 months. That would mean that CD rates would also fall in the future. So locking in an 18-month CD now can help you get the highest rate possible before any rates fall.\nDo 18-Month CDs Beat Inflation?\nAn 18-month CD can help you hedge against high inflation because the rate you can earn may be more than the inflation rate. For example, in July 2024, the inflation rate was 2.9%. At that same time, 18-month CD rates paid over 5.00%. You can earn more on your savings with an 18-month CD to help combat the additional costs you'll incur, thanks to inflation.\nWhen Is an 18-Month CD a Good Choice?\nAn 18-month CD is a suitable option for money you won't need in the coming year or longer. For those with a specific plan for the money, such as a down payment on a house or paying college tuition bills for a child, an 18-month CD might provide just the time frame you need to keep funds safe and reliably earning interest.\nAnother appeal of 18-month CDs is to provide one rung of a shortened CD ladder. A CD ladder is a strategy for investing your funds in five CDs of differing terms rather than all at once. For a yearly ladder, you would own a 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year CD. But you can also create a shorter ladder, with six-month increments between the CDs (e.g., 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, etc.).\nAre Online Bank CDs Safe?\nMany of the highest deposit rates, whether for CDs, savings accounts, or money market accounts, are offered by online banks. Some of these are online-only banks, meaning they operate solely on the Internet, while others are brick-and-mortar banks with a separate online banking arm. Sometimes the online operations of physical banks even have an entirely different name and brand identity.\nThough you may feel nervous depositing your funds into an Internet bank instead of at a physical branch, online accounts and institutions are just as safe as their more traditional counterparts. That's because FDIC insurance doesn't discriminate—the $250,000 in deposit insurance it provides consumers in case of bank failure applies equally to online and brick-and-mortar banks.18\nWhy Do Shorter CDs Sometimes Pay More Than Longer CDs?\nShorter CDs sometimes pay more than longer CDs because the institution wants you to open an account with them. These shorter CDs may be promotional CDs with high rates but low terms. The lower the term, the less you'll earn on your money, even if it's a higher interest rate.\nAnother factor is that banks and credit unions decide their CD yields based on where they think the federal funds rate will be in the future. So when it's expected that future interest rates will be lower than today's rates, it's common to see short- or mid-term CDs paying the best rates.\nHow Do You Build a CD Ladder?\nA CD ladder enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it.\nTake the amount of money you want to invest in CDs and divide it by five.\nPut one-fifth of the funds into a top-earning 1-year CD, another fifth into a top 2-year CD, another into a 3-year CD, and so forth through a 5-year CD. Let’s say you have $25,000 available. That would give you five CDs of varying lengths, each with a value of $5,000.\nWhen the first CD matures in a year, you take the resulting funds and open a top-rate 5-year CD.\nOne year later, your initial 2-year CD will mature, and you'll invest those funds into another 5-year CD.\nContinue doing this every year with whichever CD is maturing until you end up with a portfolio of five CDs all earning 5-year APYs, but with one of them maturing every 12 months, keeping your money a bit more accessible than if all of it were locked up for a full five years.\nCan You Lose Money in a CD?\nYou can't lose your principal when you deposit it in a CD. But you can lose out on interest in the CD if you withdraw it early. Most CDs come with an early withdrawal penalty (but not all CDs have penalties) so if you take your money out of the account before the term is up, you may pay a price. CDs are federally insured though, so if you're worried about losing money in a CD due to a bank failure, you can rest assured that your money is backed by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000 per institution.18\nFinancial Institutions We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed over 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

Best 18-Month CD Rates\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000. \nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

  "text": "Commodities - Trading and Investing\nYour Guide to Investing in Commodities\nFrequently Asked Questions\nA commodity is a basic good that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. They are often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services and while the quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, it is essentially uniform across producers.\nCommodities—precious metals, agriculture goods, and oil & gas—have often been positioned as hedges against inflation. However, commodities tend to respond to changes in the dollar's relative strength in international markets rather than domestic inflation pressures.\nCommodities work differently in spot markets and derivatives markets. In spot markets, the buyers and sellers exchange cash for immediate delivery of the commodity. In derivatives markets, the buyers and sellers exchange cash for the right to future delivery of that commodity. Derivatives holders will often roll over or close out their positions before delivery can happen since they aren’t necessarily looking to hold the commodity, but just speculate on its value.\nThe automobile industry is one of the largest consumers of the world's raw materials. Some of the most common materials that industry relies on include aluminum, glass, and the iron ore to make steel, as well as petroleum products used to make plastics, rubber, and other special fibers.\nKey Terms\nGross Processing Margin (GPM)\nThe spread between the cost of a raw commodity and the income it generates once sold as a finished product is known as the gross processing margin. It is affected by supply and demand.\nMineral Rights\nIn the U.S., mineral rights are legally distinct from surface rights. Mineral rights are the ownership rights to underground resources such as fossil fuels, metals and ores, and mineable rocks such as limestone and salt.\nCommodities Hoarding\nWhile not exclusively used in the context of commodities, “hoarding” often refers to the purchase and warehousing of large quantities of a commodity by a speculator with the intent of benefiting from future price increases.\nHotellings Theory\nHotelling's Theory defines the price or yield at which the owner of a nonrenewable resource will extract it and sell it, rather than leave it and wait. Specifically, it suggests that that price will be above that which safe interest-paying securities such as U.S. Treasury Bonds will pay.\nCommodity ETF\nA commodity exchange traded fund (ETF) tracks the prices of a commodity or that commodity's corresponding index. There are commodity ETFs that can be used to gain exposure to many popular types of commodities including gold, silver, oil, and natural gas.\nS&P GSCI\nThe S&P GSCI is a benchmark commodities index that tracks the performance of the global commodities market and is made up of 24 exchange-traded futures contracts that cover commodities spanning five sectors.\nExplore Commodities\nTimberland Investment: Overview, Risks, Examples\nThe 5 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar\nPrecious Metals ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nAgricultural ETFs: What You Need to Know\nCopper ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nPlatinum ETFs: What They Are and How They Work\nHow to Invest in Commodities\nBest Ways to Earn Passive Income\nHow to Invest in Gold and Silver\nCost Depletion: Meaning, Formula, Example\nETC vs. ETF: What's the Difference?\nDemand for Frac Sand and Concrete Drives Scarcity\nCommodity Investing: Top Technical Indicators\nThe World's 6 Biggest Corn Producers\nResource Curse: Definition, Overview and Examples\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE): What It Is and What It Does\nWhat Is Henry Hub?

  "text": "Best Medicare Advantage Plans for 2025\nWe independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. \nThe best Medicare Advantage 2025 plan provider is Cigna because of its low costs and great ratings for member experience. Kaiser Permanente and Aetna are also among the top Medicare Advantage providers. Medicare Advantage (MA) (also known as Medicare Part C) is a private alternative to Original Medicare with extra benefits like dental and vision coverage. \nTo find the best Medicare Advantage providers, we researched 11 insurance companies and rated them on 78 factors, including cost, plan options, and Medicare star ratings. The best providers have low out-of-pocket costs, high ratings, and a great member experience. \nBest Medicare Advantage Plans for 2025 \nBest Overall, Best for Low Costs: Cigna \nAlso Great for Low Costs: Alignment Health \nBest for Nationwide Coverage: Aetna \nBest for Patient Experience, Best for Drug Coverage: Kaiser Permanente \nBest for Special Needs Plans: Humana \nBest Overall, Best for Low Costs : Cigna \nCigna\nAverage Medicare Star Rating: 3.5\nAverage Monthly Premium for Parts C and D: $5.50\nAverage Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit: $5,471\nWhy We Chose It \nMember experience ratings tell how actual customers perceive the quality of the care they receive, such as communication with doctors and coordination of their health care needs. Cigna has one of the best member experience scores among the 11 companies we reviewed. \nCigna also has lower out-of-pocket costs compared to many other Medicare Advantage insurers. Among the Medicare Advantage providers we evaluated, Cigna has one of the lowest average annual premiums and the second-lowest drug deductible. \nCigna's sale of its Medicare Advantage business to Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) is expected to take place in early 2025, pending regulatory approval. Until then, Cigna will continue to service customers as usual.1 In the meantime, Cigna is reportedly scaling back Medicare Advantage offerings in eight states. The cuts affect 36 plans in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah.2\nPros & Cons \nPros\nExcellent member experience ratings\nLow premiums and deductibles\nMost plans have a $0 drug deductible\nHas live customer service chat\nCons\nBelow-average overall Medicare star ratings\nOnly available in 30 states\nOverview \nCigna earned one of the highest member experience scores in our study. Across its plans, its average member experience rating from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is 3.39 out of 5, which is higher than our study average of 3.27. However, Cigna has below-average Medicare star ratings in most other categories, including for managing chronic conditions and screenings, tests, and vaccines. \nOne of Cigna’s standout features is its low out-of-pocket costs. It has the second-cheapest average premium and the second-lowest average Part D (drug coverage) deductible among the best insurers in our study. Nearly all (98%) of Cigna’s Medicare Advantage plans have a $0 drug deductible. Its average out-of-pocket maximum is $5,471, which is better than the average among the other 10 insurers we reviewed. \nCigna was established in 1982 and is headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Its Medicare Advantage plans are available in 30 states, a list that excludes California, Michigan, and Massachusetts, among others. \nAlso Great for Low Costs : Alignment Health \nAverage Medicare Star Rating: 4.2\nAverage Monthly Premium for Parts C and D: $9.57\nAverage Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit: $3,524\nWhy We Chose It \nAlignment Health earned an honorable mention for low costs in our study because it has the third-lowest average premium (behind Cigna and Molina) and the lowest average out-of-pocket maximum among the top insurers. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nLowest average out-of-pocket maximum\nAffordable premiums\nGreat Medicare star ratings\nSecond-highest patient satisfaction score\nCons\nOnly available in five states\nLow customer service rating\nOverview \nAlignment Health is another Medicare Advantage provider to consider if you’re looking for low costs. Its average annual Medicare Advantage (Part C) premium with drug coverage is $9.57, the third cheapest in our study after Cigna and Molina. Alignment Health also has the lowest average out-of-pocket maximum in our study ($3,524), which is much lower than Cigna’s average out-of-pocket maximum of $5,471. \nAnother thing we like about Alignment Health is its high overall Medicare star rating. Its plans averaged a rating of 4.2 out of 5, which is the second-best in our study. It also had the highest Medicare star ratings for managing chronic conditions. While Alignment Health earned high patient care scores, its customer service score was among the lowest in our analysis of 11 insurance companies. \nAlignment Health was founded in 2013 and is based in Orange, California. You can purchase plans in five states: Arizona, California, Nevada, North Carolina, and Texas. \nBest for Nationwide Coverage : Aetna \nAetna\nAverage Medicare Star Rating: 3.9\nAverage Monthly Premium for Parts C and D: $22.66\nAverage Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit: $6,054\nWhy We Chose It \nAetna sells Medicare Advantage plans in nearly every state. Only two other companies in our study offer that kind of coverage. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nPlans are available in 48 states and D.C.\nLower premiums than other nationwide insurers\nCons\nLow star ratings for screenings, tests, vaccines\nPoor score for member complaints\nHighest drug deductible among the best companies\nNot available in Hawaii or Alaska\nOverview \nAetna provides Medicare Advantage plans in 48 states and Washington, D.C., a larger coverage area than most of the other best insurers in our study. So, unless you live in Hawaii or Alaska, your state should have a plan available. And you may be able to get it for a small initial cost. Aetna’s average annual premium is one of the lowest among the top providers, but it has the highest drug deductible. Aetna’s average out-of-pocket maximum is $6,054, which is not much higher than our study’s average of $6,015. \nAmong all its plans, Aetna’s average Medicare star rating is 3.86, slightly better than average compared to the companies on this list. But looking at how it scores in some of the sub-categories that make up that overall star rating, Aetna has weaknesses. Its rating for screenings, tests, and vaccines is 2.98 out of 5, the worst on this list. Its scores for member complaints and changes in plan performance are also lower than those of other companies in our study, including Alignment Health and Kaiser Permanente. \nAetna was founded in 1853 and is based in Hartford, Connecticut. \nBest for Patient Experience, Best for Drug Coverage : Kaiser Permanente \nKaiser Permanente\nAverage Medicare Star Rating: 4.3\nAverage Monthly Premium for Parts C and D: $44.12\nAverage Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit: $4,976\nWhy We Chose It \nKaiser Permanente has the highest Medicare star rating and the highest rating from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) in our study. Both ratings heavily consider patient experience. \nKaiser Permanente’s average drug deductibles for standard and Special Needs Plans are the lowest in our study. Some plans also have an over-the-counter benefit that you can use for certain medications, such as pain relievers and supplements. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nExcellent star ratings in many categories\nThe highest NCQA rating in our study\nMost standard plans have no drug deductible\nLowest drug deductible for standard and Special Needs Plans\nCons\nPlans are sold in just eight states and Washington, D.C.\nExpensive premiums\nOverview \nKaiser Permanente’s Part C plans earn some of the best ratings. Its plans have the best average Medicare star ratings (4.28) and NCQA ratings (4.56) in our study and the highest Medicare scores for screenings, tests, and vaccines, and member complaints. It also received good ratings for managing chronic conditions and customer service. \nThe company stands out as the best Medicare Advantage provider for drug coverage. It has the lowest average annual Part D drug deductible ($3.92) and the lowest average drug deductible for special needs plans ($300.94). Nearly all of Kaiser Permanente’s standard plans have a $0 drug deductible. However, it has the most expensive premiums in our study, and less than half of its plans that include drug coverage have a $0 premium. \nKaiser Permanente was established in 1945 and is based in Oakland, California. Its Medicare Advantage plans are sold in eight states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, and Washington, D.C.\nBest for Special Needs Plans : Humana \nHumana\nAverage Medicare Star Rating: 3.7\nAverage Monthly Premium for Parts C and D: $29.67\nAverage Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit: $6,936\nWhy We Chose It \nHumana offers all three types of special needs plans (chronic, institutional, and dual-eligible). Humana’s special needs plans have some of the lowest average premiums out of the insurers we evaluated. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nOffers all three types of special needs plan\nGood prices for special needs plans\nAvailable in 48 states and Washington, D.C.\nCons\nLow NCQA and Medicare star ratings\nAbove-average premiums for standard plans\nHigher out-of-pocket maximum than other insurers\nOverview \nEnrollment in special needs plans has doubled since 2019.3 Humana sells all three types of special needs plans at good prices. Its average special needs plan premium that includes Part D coverage is $22.22, which is cheaper than other companies that offer all three types of plans. Among the best Medicare Advantage insurers, only Kaiser Permanente and Alignment Health offer lower rates than Humana, and they don’t offer every type of special needs plan. \nWhile Humana can be a good choice for people shopping for a special needs plan, its standard Medicare Advantage plans aren’t the best. Humana’s plans have lower NCQA and Medicare star ratings than other top insurers we reviewed. Additionally, Humana’s plans have above-average premiums and out-of-pocket maximums. Only one-third of its Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage have a $0 premium. \nNote\nOn Oct. 18, 2024, Humana sued the Department of Health and Human Services over its 2025 Medicare star ratings, which dropped sharply for a plan that accounts for nearly half of its Medicare Advantage membership.4 The decline follows a change by the CMS in how it calculates star ratings. Five other suits were filed over star ratings in 2024, including two by Elevance and Scan Health Plan that resulted in CMS having to recalculate 2024 star ratings.56\nBased in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana began selling health insurance plans in 1961. Plans are sold in 48 states and Washington, D.C. They’re not sold in New York. \nBottom Line \nCigna offers the best Medicare Advantage plans overall for 2025. It has some of the lowest out-of-pocket costs and premiums among the companies we reviewed. Cigna also received an excellent Medicare star rating for member experience. \nHowever, Cigna doesn’t have the best star ratings across the board. If you’re looking for an excellent patient experience, plans from Kaiser Permanente have higher average Medicare star ratings and NCQA ratings. Alignment Health also has excellent prices but is only available in a few states. Aetna is a solid choice that's available in most areas, while Humana has the best special needs plans. \nResearch Insight\n\"Aside from an overall star rating, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also publishes scores for specific subcategories, such as how well a plan helps manage chronic conditions, gives access to tests and screenings, and whether the insurer makes decisions on claims in a timely fashion. Considering these star ratings alongside out-of-pocket costs can ensure that you find coverage that matches your expectations. You can see a plan's star rating using the Medicare Plan Finder tool on Medicare.gov.\"\n— Shanker Narayan, Investopedia Research Analyst\nWhat Is Medicare Advantage? \nMedicare Advantage, also called Medicare Part C, is an alternative to Original Medicare (Parts A and B). Medicare Advantage plans are sold by private insurance companies and include Part A (hospital insurance), Part B (medical insurance), and, typically, Part D (prescription drug insurance). Some Medicare Advantage plans provide additional benefits that original Medicare doesn’t include, like dental, hearing, and vision coverage.7 \nMedicare Advantage vs. Original Medicare \nMedicare Advantage and Original Medicare differ in a few ways. Below, you can see how Medicare Advantage and Original Medicare compare when it comes to coverage, cost, and more. \nChanges Coming to Medicare in 2025 \nMedicare Advantage is changing in some significant ways in 2025, including: \nThe Medicare coverage gap or “donut hole” will be eliminated for drug coverage.\nAll Part D plans will have an out-of-pocket maximum of $2,000.\nIf you already have a Medicare Advantage plan, it could have new premiums, formularies, and copayments for 2025. Review your annual notice of change letter carefully to see what’s new. \nEnrollees will have the option to use a monthly payment plan to spread out their medication costs.\nPlans will send a mid-year notice about unused supplemental benefits, like dental and hearing coverage.\nA new Outpatient Behavioral Health coverage category will expand access to mental health services covered under Medicare.\nHow to Choose a Medicare Advantage Plan \nThere are lots of Medicare Advantage plans on the market, but some may suit your needs better than others. Here are a few things to consider as you compare plans: \nPlan type: When shopping for Medicare Advantage, consider what type of plan you want. Patient provider organizations (PPOs) provide more flexibility in seeing doctors out of network and don’t require referrals to see a specialist. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) only allow you to see in-network providers and typically require referrals from a primary care provider—but the plan's costs may be lower. \nStar ratings: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publishes star ratings for every Medicare Advantage plan. A 5-star rating is the best, and a 1-star rating is the worst. You can see star ratings when you search for plans through the Medicare.gov plan finder tool.\nCost: When comparing Medicare Advantage plans, it’s essential to consider not only premiums, but also the out-of-pocket maximum and deductibles. Make sure you have enough savings to cover the out-of-pocket maximum in the event of an emergency.\nBenefits: Medicare Advantage plans offer different benefits, like hearing, vision, and dental coverage. Some plans also cover emergency care in other countries, fitness benefits, telehealth visits, and transportation to and from doctor’s appointments. \nDrug coverage: If you take medications, choose a plan that covers your regular prescriptions. You should also check the copayment for your medications, which will differ depending on the plan.\nNetwork: Pay attention to whether your current doctors are in the network of the Medicare Advantage plan you want. Otherwise, you’ll have to find different providers to avoid paying expensive out-of-pocket costs.\nYou can enroll in Medicare Advantage starting three months before you turn 65, and up to three months after you turn 65.8 If you’re already enrolled in Medicare Advantage, you can only switch or drop your plan during certain times of the year.\nWhen Will 2025 Medicare Advantage Plans Be Available? \nYou can sign up for, change, or drop a Medicare Advantage plan between Oct. 15 and Dec. 7, 2024. During this time, you can also switch between Medicare Advantage and Original Medicare (with a Medicare supplement plan if you wish). \nIf you’re already in a Medicare Advantage plan, you can also make changes during MA open enrollment between Jan. 1 and March 31. During this time, you can switch to a different Medicare Advantage plan or go back to Original Medicare. \nHow Much Do Medicare Advantage Plans Cost? \nThe cost of Medicare Advantage plans can vary depending on your chosen plan and where you live. Here are the main costs you should know about: \nMonthly premium: Many Medicare Advantage plans have a $0 premium, meaning you don’t have to pay anything each month for the plan. For example, 80% of Cigna’s Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage have no premium. The average monthly premium for plans in 2025 is about $17.9 Keep in mind that you still have to pay the Medicare Part B premium, which was $174.70 in 2024 (Part B costs for 2025 were not available as of Oct. 24, 2024).10\nDeductibles: Some plans have a deductible, which is the amount you pay before the plan starts covering costs. Our analysis of CMS.gov data shows that the average annual drug deductible for Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage is $306.10 in 2025.\nCopays and coinsurance: These are the amounts you pay when you get services like visiting a doctor or filling a prescription. For example, you might pay a $20 copay for a doctor's visit or 20% coinsurance of the cost for certain medical services.\nMaximum out-of-pocket (MOOP): Medicare Advantage plans set a yearly limit on how much you can spend on covered services. In 2025, the average in-network MOOP for Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage is $5,852.15.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhich Medicare Advantage Plan Has the Highest Rating?\nIn our study of 11 Medicare Advantage companies, Cigna received our highest rating (4.8 out of 5) because of its broad availability area, low prices, and decent Medicare star ratings. Among the companies we reviewed, Kaiser Permanente had the best Medicare star ratings overall (its plans averaged 4.3 out of 5). However, Medicare star ratings aren’t the only thing we considered, and Kaiser wasn’t our favorite overall company in part because it’s only available in eight states and Washington, D.C. To find a quality Medicare Advantage plan in your area, it’s important to research and compare multiple insurers based on your needs and preferences.\nWhy Are People Leaving Medicare Advantage Plans?\nData on 2024 Medicare Advantage plans shows that enrollment is increasing, with fewer people leaving their plans. More than half of eligible Medicare recipients are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicare Advantage growth can be attributed to the number of plans with $0 premiums, capped out-of-pocket spending, and extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t offer.3\nHowever, some people are unhappy with Medicare Advantage and the main complaints are that you may need to get preauthorization from the insurer before you receive certain kinds of care, and you need a referral to see a specialist.\nWhat Is the Medicare Donut Hole or Coverage Gap?\nThe Medicare “donut hole” is a gap in prescription drug coverage, which in 2024 requires you to pay 25% of drug costs after spending $5,030. This gap is going away in 2025, and there will be a $2,000 limit on how much you have to pay out-of-pocket for covered drugs. This change applies to everyone with Medicare Part D, including those with Medicare Advantage.11\nCan I Drop My Medicare Advantage Plan and Go Back to Original Medicare?\nYes, you can drop Medicare Advantage and enroll in Original Medicare during Medicare open enrollment from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. Your new plan will go into effect starting Jan. 1. You can also switch from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare during the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period, which happens between Jan. 1 and March 31. Your new plan starts on the first day of the month after you join the plan.\nCompanies We Evaluated\nCigna, Alignment Healthcare, Aetna/CVS Health, Kaiser Permanente, AARP/UnitedHealthcare, Humana, Devoted Health, Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), Elevance Health (formerly Anthem), Wellcare, Molina Healthcare\nHow We Chose the Best Medicare Advantage Providers \nTo identify which Medicare insurance companies to review, we examined research conducted by market intelligence and consulting firms, such as Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Chartis Group, and McKinsey. These reports provided insight into individual market share, enrollment growth, and nationwide availability for major Medicare providers in the United States. We considered this information, along with our previous research, to select 13 Medicare Advantage, Part D, and Medigap providers for our review. \nFor each of these companies, we collected data from third-party rating agencies such as the credit rating agency AM Best and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), an independent organization that rates health care plans on quality and customer satisfaction. We also gathered data from government websites and databases provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and directly from companies via websites, media representatives, and existing partnerships. The data collection process ran from Aug. 27 to Oct. 10, 2024. \nWe then developed a quantitative model that scores each Medicare company based on the data we collected. We ensured the integrity of our data by cross-referencing the records in our database with primary sources. \nWe weighted the categories as follows for this article: \nCustomer Satisfaction: 5%\nStar Ratings: 25%\nPlan Types: 11%\nCosts: 39%\nPlan Benefits: 5%\nAvailability: 15%\nFinancial Strength: 0%\nRead our full methodology for reviewing Medicare insurance providers. \nAlice Morgan / Investopedia. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Nov. 1, 2024. \nCertificates of deposit (CDs) are fixed-interest accounts where you can deposit your money and then withdraw it later. Since 2019, we've been tracking the CD rates of more than 200 nationally available banks and credit unions every weekday, putting the results in our daily ranking of the highest CD yields across every major term. Though we focus on the highest returns available, we also provide you with details on each CD's exact term, the minimum required deposit, and its early withdrawal penalty policy. \nIn the News\nThe Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18 meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means CD rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years.123\nBelow are the top CD rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere. \nBest CD Rates Today \nRanked below are the top 15 or more APYs on nationally available CDs with minimum deposits of no more than $25,000.

When ranking CD rates, we look at factors like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. \nThe CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three to five times as much as the national average—or even more. To be eligible for our rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor). \nWhat Is a CD Rate? \nA CD rate is an interest rate that shows what a bank or credit union will pay you for depositing your money with them for a certain time in a certificate of deposit (CD). For example, if the rate is 5.50% for a 1-year CD, the bank or credit union will pay you 5.50% in interest on your money for keeping it in the account, untouched, for 12 months. If you deposit $1,000 in that account and keep it there for 12 months, you will earn $55 at the end of the term.\nTip\nThe interest rate and the APY offered on a CD may be slightly different. An interest rate is the raw rate you earn on your money, while the annual percentage yield (APY) is the full amount of interest earned after compounding at the end of one year. APY is almost always slightly higher than the interest rate. For example, an interest rate on a 3-month CD could be 5.023% while the APY on that same CD is 5.15%.\nHow Much Does $10,000 Earn in a CD in One Year?\nIf you invest $10,000 in a CD for one year, you could earn at least a few hundred dollars, depending on the interest rate. For example, with an APY of 5.00%, you'd get $500 in interest after one year. CD rates can change, so locking in a high interest rate today could guarantee you the maximum earnings, especially if CD rates drop by next year. \nThere are a few scenarios you may encounter or need to decide between when it comes to investing $10,000 in a CD. It'll depend on the rate and CD term you choose. Here are a few scenarios: \nHow Does a CD Work? \nA certificate of deposit (CD) is similar to a bank deposit account. The difference is what you're agreeing to when you sign on the dotted line (even if that signature is now digital). \nA CD works by locking your deposit up for a set time. When time is up, the CD pays you the set interest rate you agreed to when you opened it. A CD locks you into four specific things:\nThe interest rate: Most CDs pay a fixed interest rate. The bank cannot later change the rate and therefore reduce your earnings. On the flip side, a fixed interest rate may hurt you if rates later rise and you've lost your opportunity to take advantage of higher-paying CDs.\nThe term: This is the length of time you agree to leave your money deposited to avoid any penalty (such as six months or 1 year, etc.) The term ends on the \"maturity date,\" when you can withdraw your money penalty-free.\nThe principal: Except for some specialty CDs that allow add-on deposits, this is the amount you agree to deposit into the CD, at the time of opening.\nThe institution: The bank or credit union where you open your CD will determine aspects of the agreement, such as early withdrawal penalties and whether your CD will be automatically reinvested if you don’t provide other instructions at the time of maturity. Credit unions may also require you to open a high-yield savings account or money market account before you open a CD.\nOnce your CD is established and funded, the bank or credit union will set the terms and conditions like with most other deposit accounts. You'll get either monthly or quarterly statement periods, paper or electronic statements, and usually monthly or quarterly interest payments deposited to your CD balance, where the interest will compound. The money you put into a CD is insured like other deposit accounts—up to $250,000 per customer, per institution. \nWhy You Might Not Recognize the Banks and Credit Unions in Our CD Rankings\nYou typically won't see big names like Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC, Navy Federal, or Bank of America in our rankings of the best CD rates. We research their rates, but they don't make our list simply because they don't pay enough. Extremely large banks typically don't need to attract customers and deposits like smaller institutions do, so they don't need to use rates to win business. In fact, some of the biggest banks pay interest rates very close to zero, but it depends and can change from month to month. Our best CD rates are based on careful research, and we update this article every weekday to give you the best CD rates available nationwide.\nWho Should Get a CD?\nIf you're looking to save money for a certain amount of time and want to make sure you don't touch it until you need it, you should get a CD. If you're risk-averse and don't want to invest money in the stock market because there's no guarantee you'll see a return, then you should consider a CD. CDs offer a fixed rate of return that guarantees you earnings when the term is over. And right now, CD rates are high—over 4% and 5% in many cases—so you can earn a decent amount on your deposit. \nFast Fact\nWhen asked in September where they are investing their money, 13% of Investopedia readers said they are putting more into CDs, behind ETFs, individual stocks, index funds, and money market funds.\nCDs Can Help You Beat Inflation\nIn September 2024, inflation was 2.4%, while the top APY offered across all CDs was 5.20%.19 CD rates reached historic highs in 2023 as a result of the Fed's rate-hike policy to cool inflation, which had reached 9.1% in June 2022.20 CDs can help you combat inflation by paying you interest on your money, even though you may be paying more for goods and services. This will not always be the case, though. Interest rates are often increased to help combat high inflation. With inflation trending toward the standard 2% mark the Fed aims for each year, the federal funds rate was reduced in September for the first time in four years. CD rates have subsequently begun to decline.1 \nRight now, the best CD rates are still over 5.00%, which is much higher than what CD rates were just two years ago. Buying a CD now is a good idea since you'll be able to earn a higher interest rate than you might be able to earn in a year from now. Right now, you're guaranteed a high interest rate, even if the Fed decides to lower rates during the term of your CD. Waiting to buy a CD could mean earning a lower interest rate on a CD and losing out on higher guaranteed earnings. So if you are debating whether to buy a CD or not, don't wait. \nTypes of CDs \nRegular CDs: A regular CD is a CD with a fixed interest rate for a set period. Brick-and-mortar traditional banks, as well as online institutions and credit unions, offer these kinds of CDs. They may also be called traditional CDs.\nVariable-rate CDs: A variable-rate CD is one where the interest rate can change based on the prime rate, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Treasury bills, or a market index. The entire term for a variable-rate CD is still fixed, though, and does not change. These are sometimes called \"flex\" CDs.\nJumbo CDs: A jumbo CD is a CD that requires a larger opening deposit, such as $50,000 or $100,000.\nNo-penalty CDs: A no-penalty CD is exactly what it sounds like—you do not pay a fee for withdrawing your money early.\nBrokered CDs: A brokered CD is one that an investor can buy through a brokerage firm or from a sales representative other than a bank or credit union.\nStep-up CDs: A step-up CD allows you to increase your interest rate when you can. Your rate is not fixed for the entire term; you can capitalize on higher interest rates with a step-up CD. A step-up CD may also be called a bump-up CD.\nPromotional-rate CDs: This CD offers a promotional rate that may be higher than a regular CD rate and is only offered for a certain time period. You may be able to lock in a high rate by opening this kind of CD within a promotional period, like 30 days or before the end of the month.\nNote\nOnline banks or credit unions tend to offer high CD rates because of the lower overhead costs. If you're worried about opening an online bank account, just do your research to ensure the institution comes with FDIC or NCUA insurance. It may also be an online arm of a larger, brick-and-mortar institution, which could give you peace of mind. Big banks like Citibank, U.S. Bank, Bank of America, Chase, Capital One, Wells Fargo, American Express, and more offer CDs too, but they may not pay the highest CD rates. It's important to shop around and consider all financial institutions before choosing a CD.\nPros and Cons of CDs \nPros \nGuaranteed yield for the CD's full term: Most CDs are a fixed-rate product, so you're guaranteed to earn the rate you lock in until the CD's maturity date, no matter what the Federal Reserve does with the fed funds rate in the future.\nHigher interest rates than liquid accounts: Banks generally offer higher rates on CDs than on savings and money market accounts, in exchange for you keeping the money in the account and not touching it until you're allowed to withdraw it.\nFully predictable earnings and withdrawal date: Because you know the CD's rate and term, you can calculate exactly how much you'll earn and when you can withdraw the funds without penalty.\nExtremely safe, with almost no bank or market risk: When you open a CD at an FDIC bank or an NCUA credit union, up to $250,000 in deposits are federally protected against the institution's failure.2122 You're also safe from the market volatility—and potential loss in value—that can occur with stock and bond investments.\nCan deter spending temptations: Withdrawing funds before your CD matures causes you to pay an early withdrawal penalty, which can help keep you from giving in to temptations to dip into your savings for an unplanned purchase. This means a CD could be good for building your emergency fund.\nCons \nEarly withdrawal of the funds incurs a penalty: If you do need to withdraw your CD funds before maturity, the bank or credit union will impose an early withdrawal penalty. Typically, it's calculated as a certain number of months of forfeited interest earnings.\nYou can’t add to your deposit: With the rare exception of add-on CDs, you can only deposit funds into the certificate at the time of initial deposit. This means you miss out on compound interest since you're not able to grow the account and apply the interest rate to your new balance every month like with a savings account.\nIf CD rates rise, you may miss out on a higher yield: If you lock in your CD rate, but rates increase shortly after, you may wish you'd waited to score a higher return.\nIf CD rates drop, you may wish you’d chosen a longer CD: Though you'll still be well-served by any CD yield you have locked in before interest rates drop, you may wish you'd locked in a longer-term CD to extend that competitive yield for a longer period.\nTypically return less than stocks over long periods: Though stock investments involve more risk and less predictability, they may offer greater returns over long periods.\nHow to Choose the Best CD for You \nWhen choosing a CD, consider the following factors: \nYour financial goals: Both short-term goals and long-term goals are important.\nHow much money you have to deposit: CDs have minimums, so if you only have $500 to deposit, you'll need to find a CD with that minimum balance requirement.\nHow long you can leave that money in the CD without touching it: This will help you determine the right term—whether that's a one-year CD or a three-year CD.\nInterest rates offered for your term and minimum deposit: The higher the rate, the more you will earn on your deposit during the CD term.\nCD type: Is it a bump-up CD or a regular CD? This will ensure you're choosing one that meets your needs and goals.\nOnce you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest. \nChristine DiGangi, Investopedia Product Reviews Team\nI had two short-term savings goals, so I looked for a 6-month and a 1-year CD with a high APY that I could ladder. I checked out a few of the options on our list and decided to go with CIT Bank and Bread Savings, because applying for the CDs online was really easy, and they offered mobile apps—I’m one of those people who checks their financial accounts frequently, if not daily. I’d keep accounts with both of them (assuming the rates are good when the two terms end).\nWhat Do You Need to Open One of the Best CDs?\nTo open a CD, you'll need some personal information including, but not limited to: \nName\nAddress\nPhone number\nFor example, you may need to provide a copy of your license or ID if you don't have an account with that institution already. \nWhen you have that info handy, fill out the application for your CD account: \nState how you'll fund the CD, whether via an electronic transfer or another method.\nFund the CD.\nState how you want to receive the interest, all at the end or in monthly installments (if required).\nOnce you've done all that, you should officially have a CD in your name, though check with the institution to ensure you've taken all the right steps. \nHow to Build a CD Ladder \nSmart CD investors have a specific tactic for hedging against rate changes over time and maximizing their return. It's called a CD ladder and it enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it. \nTake the amount of money you want to invest in CDs and divide it by five.\nPut one-fifth of the funds into a top-earning 1-year CD, another fifth into a top 2-year CD, another into a 3-year CD, and so forth through a 5-year CD. Let’s say you have $25,000 available. That would give you five CDs of varying lengths, each with a value of $5,000.\nWhen the first CD matures in a year, you take the resulting funds and open a top-rate 5-year CD.\nOne year later, your initial 2-year CD will mature, and you'll invest those funds into another 5-year CD.\nContinue doing this every year with whichever CD is maturing until you end up with a portfolio of five CDs all earning 5-year APYs, but with one of them maturing every 12 months, keeping your money a bit more accessible than if all of it were locked up for a full five years.\nWhat Happens if I Withdraw From a CD Early?\nIf you withdraw money early from a CD, you'll likely have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. This is usually a certain number of months' worth of interest that you earned in the CD thus far. For example, if you had deposited $10,000 in a 12-month CD with a rate of 5.00%, and withdrew it early, you might have to pay three months' worth of the interest you had earned. So instead of cashing out $500 at the end of the CD term, you'd walk away with less interest earned, the exact amount depending on how early you withdrew the money. \nNow, not all CDs have early withdrawal penalties. Some no-penalty CDs are available and have more flexibility, However, they may also come with lower interest rates.\nHow Are CDs Taxed? \nJust like how the interest you earn on any money you have in savings, money market, and checking accounts is taxable as interest income at both the state and federal levels, the interest you earn on your money in a CD is too. \nYour CD earnings will be reported to the IRS in the year they were earned and posted to your account, so that's when they're taxable—even though you may not withdraw the funds for one or more years into the future.23 \nFor example, if you have $1,000 in a 1-year CD with a 5.00% interest rate, you'll earn $50 in interest. You owe taxes on that $50, but not on the $1,000 principal you deposited at the start of the term. \nIf you decide to add a CD to your IRA, you may not have to pay taxes until you're ready to withdraw in retirement. You can add CDs in both traditional and Roth IRAs. With a Roth IRA, you are not penalized for withdrawing money from the account if it's open for at least five years because it's funded with after-tax dollars. However, if you want to withdraw money from your Roth IRA CD before it matures, you will be hit with a CD early withdrawal penalty. If your CD matures in a traditional IRA before your retirement age, then you may not be able to withdraw that money without first paying taxes and fees.24\nAlternatives to CDs \nCDs vs. Traditional Savings Accounts\nTraditional savings accounts tend to offer lower interest rates. Banks or credit unions with no high-yield savings account options may only offer traditional savings accounts that pay 0.01% to 0.10%. While the national average for savings rates is 0.46%, according to the FDIC, many banks pay much less.25 For example, Wells Fargo's Way2Save account pays 0.01% APY and Chase offers just 0.01% with its Chase Savings account. When interest rates are high, the top CD rate can be up to 600x the rate you may earn on your money in a traditional savings account. \nCDs vs. High-Yield Savings Accounts \nIf you just aren't sold on committing your funds for a certain amount of time, or can't afford to because you may need the money in the near term, a high-yield savings account may be a better option. You'll be free to withdraw and deposit funds as you like, though some institutions will limit how many withdrawals you can make each month. Some savings accounts may also require a minimum balance.\nCDs vs. Money Market Accounts\nIf you're looking for other high-yield accounts, a money market account may serve your needs. Money market accounts offer the feature of allowing you to write checks on the account. Some money market accounts come with debit cards, but money market accounts tend to act more like savings accounts. They may also come with minimum deposit or balance requirements, and money market account rates can easily compete with savings account rates.\nCDs vs. Bonds \nIf you're interested in venturing out of the bank and into the world of bonds, you have numerous options. You could put cash savings into U.S. government I bonds, which are designed to track or beat the inflation rate. Or you could invest in U.S. Treasuries, in which you lend money to the U.S. government for a fixed amount of time. The Treasury notes with durations of four weeks to one year are called T-Bills.26 \nAnother option is corporate and municipal bonds. Though it's difficult to research individual bonds on your own, you can easily invest in a bond mutual fund or bond exchange-traded fund which is diversified across a bundle of different bond issues. You can also enter and exit these funds at any time. \nCDs vs. Brokerage Accounts\nIf you have a brokerage account, you can also hold savings in the brokerage’s cash reserve account or their money market fund (not to be confused with the money market accounts offered by banks). Just be sure to research what rate you’ll earn because in many cases, these brokerage cash accounts pay far less than what you can earn by keeping your money in an outside CD, savings account, or money market account. Some brokerages may also offer brokered CDs, another option if you're already investing with a broker and want to open a CD. \nCDs vs. Annuities\nAn annuity is a type of fixed-income investment provided by financial institutions. You can buy an annuity and pay it monthly or in a lump sum. Then, in the future, you receive fixed monthly payments. Annuities are insurance contracts that can guarantee income. While they are similar to a CD in that the income is guaranteed as long as you follow the rules of the contract, they are not as short-term as CDs may be. Annuities are most often used in retirement planning. CDs can also be used for retirement planning, but they are usually bought and held for terms of 6 months to 5 years rather than an annuity, which could be owned for 20 years or something similar. There may also be different withdrawal rules and limits and tax consequences with annuities. \nCDs vs. Treasury Bills\nTreasury bills are debt obligations backed by the U.S. government. They usually have maturities of one year or less. That timing is similar to CDs with shorter terms, but Treasury Bills may not offer the same level of return on the investment. Rates are comparable, ranging from 3.98% to 4.78% as of Sept. 26, 2024, but they can fluctuate daily.27 \nCD rates can also change daily. The thing with T-bills is that you buy them at a discount and when they mature, you receive the full amount back, plus a little more. For example, you might buy a $1,000 T-bill for $950. When the bill matures, you will get $1,000, or $50 more than what you paid for it. This increase of $50 is the interest you earn. CDs are a little less complicated, where you put in a set amount, and then receive a fixed interest rate when it matures. \nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho Has the Highest CD Rate Right Now?\nThe highest-paying CD right now is from Nuvision Credit Union with a rate of 5.50% APY for an 8-month term. That could change, though, as interest rates fluctuate daily and institutions can offer CDs with high interest rates for as long or as short of a time as they want.\nAre CDs Safe?\nCDs are safe because they are usually offered by banks or credit unions which are insured by the FDIC or NCUA. This means your money at a bank or credit union, across all of your accounts (CDs, savings, and checking, etc.) is insured for up to $250,000. CDs also come with virtually no risk since the interest rate is usually fixed; you'll know what to returns to expect before even opening the CD.\nHow Have CD Rates Changed Over Time?\nThe top CD rates have changed over time, from around 1.35% in 2021, to over 5.50% by the start of 2024. This is because CD rates typically follow the trend of the fed funds rate. So when the fed funds rate is low, CD rates tend to be low. When the fed funds rate is high, CD rates tend to be high. To combat high inflation between 2021 and 2023, the Fed raised the fed funds rate. That in turn pushed CD rates higher to 6.00% by 2024.\nWhy Are Interest Rates So High Right Now?\nCD interest rates are high right now because they follow the fed funds rate, which is currently set at a target range of 4.75%-5.00%. This is down from the 5.25%–5.50% range it had been at from July 2023 until September 2024. Beginning in 2022, the Fed raised rates from near zero to its recent high to help combat high inflation. With inflation showing signs of cooling, the Fed began lowering rates in September.28\nAre There Fees Associated With CDs?\nThere are not usually fees associated with the CD that you want to open. However, you may be required to open a savings account at the institution before you can open the CD there. This could require a deposit of $5 or more. Additionally, some credit unions ask new members to make a charitable donation in order to sign up for an account, and this could cost up to $40.\nHow Long Can You Have Money in a CD?\nCD terms often range from 3 months to 10 years, so you can have your money in a CD for generally any length of time in between. Some CDs have terms of 8 or 9 months, others have 15-month terms, and there are 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year, 6-year, 7-year, 8-year, and 10-year terms—though the longer terms may be offered by fewer banks or credit unions.\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy a CD?\nPutting money into a CD right now may be a smart move if you're looking to earn a high interest rate on money you don't need. CD rates are over 5.00% for many terms right now, and locking up your money for six, 12, or even 24 months could help you in the long run if CD rates decline in the next year or two. CD rates are higher in 2024 than they have been in 20 years. So yes, now is a good time to buy a CD.\nWhat Is Considered a Jumbo CD?\nA CD with a minimum deposit requirement of $100,000 or more is usually considered a jumbo CD. While the required minimum deposit is higher than traditional CDs, the interest rates on jumbos are not always higher. That means you could earn a higher interest rate by depositing $100,000 in a traditional CD instead of a jumbo CD.

CD Rates \nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000. \nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. While some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

  "text": "Essential Info for Buying and Selling Securities\nIf you're looking to invest and trade stocks for the long term, then one of the best online brokers is all you need. But if you're looking to day trade, you'll want to do your research and find a platform that fits your trading style best. \nInvestopedia identified 26 trading platforms and then collected over 2,300 data points to determine which are the best for day traders. The best day trading platforms that made our list provide excellent apps for analyzing indicators and executing trades on a variety of securities including stocks, cryptocurrency, options, forex, futures, and more. \nBest Day Trading Platforms\nBest Overall: Interactive Brokers\nBest Broker for Advanced Day Traders: Interactive Brokers\nBest Charting Platform for Day Traders: Interactive Brokers\nBest Low-Cost Day Trading App: Webull\nBest Mobile Day Trading App: E*TRADE\nBest Day Trading Platform for Options: tastytrade\nOur editors independently research and recommend the best products and services. You can learn more about our independent review process and partners in our advertiser disclosure . We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links. \nFrequently Asked Questions\nInvesting takes a long-term approach to the markets, while trading involves short-term strategies to maximize returns daily, monthly, or quarterly. Investors are more likely to ride out short-term losses, while traders will make transactions that can help them profit quickly from fluctuating markets.\nHow much money you need to begin trading depends on the type of securities you want to buy. Stocks typically trade in round lots, or orders of at least 100 shares. To buy a stock priced at $60 per share, you will need $6,000 in your account. A broker may let you borrow half of that money, but you still need to produce the other $3,000. To trade options and futures, those trade by the contract. A contract represents some unit of the underlying security. In the options market, one contract is good for 100 shares of the stock.\nResults vary widely depending on various trading strategies, risk management practices, and amounts of capital available for day trading. According to University of California researchers Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, they found that many individual investors hold undiversified portfolios and trade actively, speculatively, and to their own detriment.1 Day traders also can be hit with high brokerage fees and other charges that cut into their profits.\nThe prices of shares on a stock market can be set in a number of ways. The most common way is through an auction process where buyers and sellers place bids and offers to buy or sell. A bid is the price at which somebody wishes to buy, and an offer (or ask) is the price at which somebody wishes to sell. When the bid and ask coincide, a trade is made.\nOptions allow for potential profit during both volatile times, which is possible because the prices of assets like stocks, currencies, and commodities are always moving. No matter what the market conditions are there is an options strategy that can take advantage of those conditions to profit, while taking on the risk of losing money as well.\nKey Terms\nPenny Stock\nA penny stock refers to a small company's stock that typically trades for less than $5 per share. Although some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as the NYSE, most penny stocks trade over the counter through the OTC Bulletin Board.\nCboe Volatility Index (VIX)\nThe Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Investors use the VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions.\nPrice Target\nA price target is an analyst's projection of a security's future price, one at which an analyst believes a stock is fairly valued.\nShort Position\nA short position is a trading technique used by investors who anticipate a security will fall in price. In common practice, short sellers borrow shares of stock from an investment bank or other financial institution, paying a fee to borrow the shares while the short position is in place.\nPaper Trading\nA paper trade is a simulated trade that allows an investor to practice buying and selling without risking real money. The term paper trade dates back to a time when aspiring traders practiced trading on paper before risking money in live markets—well before online trading platforms became the norm.\nStop-Loss Order\nStop-loss orders are orders with instructions to close out a position by buying or selling a security at the market when it reaches a certain price known as the stop price. A stop-loss order is a type of order used by traders to limit their loss or lock in a profit on an existing position.\nTechnical Analysis\nTechnical analysis is the study of historical market data, including price and volume. Using insights from market psychology, behavioral economics, and quantitative analysis, technical analysts aim to use past performance to predict future market behavior. The two most common forms of technical analysis are chart patterns and technical (statistical) indicators.\nForex\nThe foreign exchange market, commonly referred to as the Forex or FX, is the global marketplace for the trading of one nation's currency for another. The forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day. It has no centralized location, and no government authority oversees it.\nExplore Trading\nHow To Buy Dogecoin (DOGE)\nHow to Buy SafeMoon Crypto\n4 Best Futures Trading Platforms\nDunning-Kruger Effect: Meaning and Examples in Finance\nHow To Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB)\nBy\nGloria Chinemerem Chimelu\nUpdated Apr 26, 2023 \nHow Information Bias Can Lead to Poor Investing Decisions\nWhy Not to Quit Your Job to Trade Stocks?\nBenefits for Active Traders Who Incorporate\nPre-Market Routine Sets Stage For The Trading Day\nA Day in the Life of a Professional Forex Trader\nNeedle in a Haystack: Stock Message Boards\nHow Much Money Do You Need to Start Trading?\nAn Introduction to Trading Types: Fundamental Traders\nBeginner's Guide to Hedging: Definition and Example of Hedges in Finance\nTrading Account: Definition, How to Open, and Margin Requirements\nThe Roles of Traders and Investors\nCommon Investor and Trader Blunders\nTrading Plan: Definition, How It Works, Rules, and Examples\nWhat Is a Trading Strategy?

  "text": "What to Expect From Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Earnings Saturday\nKey Takeaways\nInvestors will home in on Berkshire's cash pile, which hit a record last quarter, and the company's plans to deploy those funds.\nDespite citing a lack of new investment opportunities, Buffett increased the firm's stake in Sirius XM last quarter.\nMarket watchers will also look out for how Buffett's portfolio changed, given the very public trimming of Bank of America shares.\nQ2 operating income was driven by gains in the insurance business as claim costs eased. The health of the insurance business will be in focus in Q3.\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) is set to report its third-quarter earnings on Saturday morning.1 Here are some things investors will be watching out for. \nBerkshire's Cash Stash \nBerkshire Hathaway’s cash pile swelled to a record $277 billion in the second quarter, up nearly $100 billion from the prior quarter. The majority of that money, roughly $235 billion, was invested in U.S. Treasurys.23 \nInvestors will be looking at this upcoming earnings report for any clues about how Berkshire plans to use or invest its massive war chest. Will Buffett unveil new positions or will the company use the money to buy back shares as it has in the past? \nBuffett said early this year that there were \"only a handful of companies\" in the U.S. that aligned with the firm's value-minded acquisition and investment strategy. The firm has since substantially trimmed a few major equity holdings. \nCFRA’s Berkshire analyst Catherine Seifert expects the company to pursue “transactions as it deploys part of its $277B cash hoard (as of June 30, 2024) amid a declining interest rate environment.”4 \nHow Has Buffett’s Portfolio Changed? \nThough cut in half this year, Apple Inc. (AAPL) likely remained Berkshire’s largest equity position in the third quarter while Buffett continued to sell one of his long-favored stocks—Bank of America (BAC.) \nBerkshire trimmed its Bank of America position by about 20% to 800 million shares in the third quarter, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.56 And it has since sold more stock. Those sales have shrunk Berkshire's stake in the bank to less than 10%, meaning the firm is no longer required to promptly disclose changes to its position.7 \nBuffett reportedly enjoys listening to Frank Sinatra on Channel 70 on Sirius XM.8 And like many of his other investments in products that he enjoys, like Coca-Cola (KO), he’s betting on Sirius XM as well. \nIn September, Sirius XM and Liberty Media, which owned tracking shares of Sirius XM, underwent a complicated split-off transaction to create one new entity.9 Berkshire, which previously owned both Sirius XM as well as the tracking shares, ended up with roughly 105 million shares in the new Sirius XM entity (SIRI).10 It upped its stake in October, to over 108 million shares, accounting for more than a third of all outstanding shares in the satellite radio provider.11 \nInvestors will be curious to see if Buffett changed some of his other significant holdings in the quarter. He unveiled new stakes in beauty products company Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and aerospace and electronics manufacturing company Heico Corp. (HEI) during the second quarter. \nOperating Income, Insurance Business in Focus \nBuffett has time and again expressed his dislike for traditional earnings metrics, choosing instead to look at operating income to appropriately capture the state of Berkshire’s businesses. \nIn the second quarter, operating income increased to $11.6 billion, driven primarily by underwriting and investments in its insurance businesses. The insurance business thrived as claims and catastrophe-related costs scaled back. \nThe size of claims and catastrophe-related losses, and the outlook for the insurance business, will be in focus on Saturday, especially with several major hurricanes having hit the Southeast in recent months.\nTrade on the Go. Anywhere, Anytime\nOne of the world's largest crypto-asset exchanges is ready for you. Enjoy competitive fees and dedicated customer support while trading securely. You'll also have access to Binance tools that make it easier than ever to view your trade history, manage auto-investments, view price charts, and make conversions with zero fees.

  "text": "Best High-Yield Savings Accounts for November 2024: Up to 5.50%\nThe best high-yield savings account rate from a nationally available institution is 5.50% APY available from Pibank. That's nearly 12 times the FDIC's national average for savings accounts of 0.45% APY.1 A high-yield savings account is great because it pays more interest, while still giving you the flexibility to withdraw your money when needed. All savings accounts and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Nov. 1, 2024. \nEvery business day, we publish a ranking based on the highest savings account APYs available that day. Below, you'll find our partners' savings and cash management accounts—from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks—followed by our top 15 ranking of the best savings account rates available nationwide. \nIn the News\nThe Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18 meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means savings rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years.234\nBest High-Yield Savings Account Rates for November 2024 \nPibank – 5.50% APY\nNewtek Bank – 5.25% APY\nOpenbank – 5.25% APY*\nTotalBank – 5.11% APY\nEverBank – 5.05% APY\nValley Direct – 5.05% APY*\nForbright Bank – 5.00% APY\nBrioDirect – 5.00% APY\nFitness Bank – 5.00% APY*\nPoppy Bank – 5.00% APY\nIvy Bank – 5.00% APY\nBank5Connect – 4.95% APY\nVio Bank – 4.90% APY\nCFG Bank – 4.90% APY\nBask Bank – 4.85% APY\nDollarSavingsDirect – 4.85% APY\nMy Banking Direct – 4.85% APY\nThe top savings account rates in the country are listed below in order of APY. Where more than one financial institution has the same rate, we've ranked accounts by those requiring the smallest minimum ongoing balance, and if the same there as well, we list the tied institutions alphabetically. \nNote that some banks call their savings accounts \"money market\" accounts. Money market accounts traditionally offer the ability to write checks, while savings accounts do not. None of the accounts listed here offer check-writing privileges, even if the name might suggest otherwise.

When ranking high-yield savings account rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best savings account, like minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best high-yield savings account rates since 2019. \nCompare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts \nWhat Is a High-Yield Savings Account? \nAs the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional ones. Often offered online, whether by an internet-only bank or the online division of a brick-and-mortar bank, they're a type of savings account that's based on the idea of holding your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that's a different bank than where you hold your checking account. \nThe difference in savings account interest rates can be dramatic, with the top accounts in the country typically offering 10 to 12 times the national average rate. And you can still keep your checking account where it is, because it's simple to link a high-yield savings account to your primary account for easy transfers. \nReasons to Open a High-Yield Savings Account \nStashing some of your cash in a savings account is smart whether you're saving for something specific, or just want to sock money away for when you'll need it in the future. Here are some common reasons to open a savings account: \nBuild an emergency fund: By putting your emergency money in a high-yield account, you'll be able to boost your balance with monthly interest earnings, while also leaving your funds fully accessible should a financial emergency arise.\nReach a specific goal: This may include buying a house or a car, sending your son or daughter to college, or going on a special vacation.\nGrow your savings: Earning interest on your money means your savings balance will grow faster than if you were making monthly contributions and not earning anything.\nExpert Take\nI first opened a high-yield savings account with American Express in 2019, and have urged friends and family to open high-yield savings accounts, too. While Amex doesn't offer the top rate nationwide, it has a great mobile app, which is how I do most of my banking. I can see my high-yield savings account right next to my credit cards, and can easily deposit money from my checking to my savings via the app. ~Hilarey Gould, Editorial Director at Investopedia\nHow Much Money Can You Make in a High-Yield Savings Account?\nThe amount of money you can earn in a high-yield savings account will be based on how much you deposit, how much you contribute per month, and what your interest rate is. \nLet's say you start with $1,000 in a high-yield savings account. You have a 5.00% APY and contribute $100 per month. After three months, you'd earn about $13 in interest. After six months, you'd earn about $31 in interest. After 12 months, you'd earn about $77 in total interest and have an ending balance of $2,277. \nNow, let's say you do the same thing—$1,000 starting balance and $100 monthly contributions—but in a regular savings account. In September 2024, the national average rate for savings accounts was 0.45%, which is still higher than what many big banks pay on savings accounts.5 U.S. Bank, Chase, and Wells Fargo, for example, all pay just 0.1% interest on their traditional savings accounts. For this example, we'll use 0.1% since that is so often what banks pay on savings accounts. \nAfter three months, you'd earn about 27 cents in interest. After six months, you'd earn about 62 cents in interest. After 12 months, you'd earn about $1.55 in total interest and have an ending balance of $2,201.55. That's over $75 less than what you could earn in a high-yield savings account. \nAccount APY Monthly Contribution 3-Month Earnings 6-Month Earnings 9-Month Earnings 12-Month Earnings Balance After 12 Months \nHigh-Yield Savings\t5.00% \t$100\t$13.50\t$30.84\t$52.08\t$77.26\t$2,277.26\t\nTraditional Savings\t0.10% \t$100\t27 cents\t62 cents\t$1.05\t$1.55\t$2,201.55 \t\nHow to Choose the Best High-Yield Savings Account \nOnce you've decided to open up a new high-yield savings account, you'll want to do your homework to make sure you're choosing the best one for your needs. Searching for a top annual percentage yield (APY) is a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you'll want to earn a competitive rate. \nThough the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you'll collect every month and every year. Also, through the power of compounding, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better. \nBut beyond the interest rate, you'll also want to make sure the account either doesn't have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY. \nWhy Different Banks Pay Different Rates\nEach bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with.\nAlso important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they've accumulated enough funds.\nCommon Savings Account Terms to Understand \nWhen researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean. \nMinimum opening deposit or initial deposit: Some bank accounts—whether a savings, checking, or money market account—stipulate a minimum deposit you need to make to open the account. It could be quite low, like $25, or could be as much as $25,000 for some high-balance accounts. And some accounts have no requirement, letting you open the account with no money deposited. Note that if an account has a initial deposit requirement but then no minimum ongoing balance, you do not need to keep that money at the bank after your initial deposit.\nMinimum balance requirement or ongoing balance: Unlike a minimum initial deposit, a minimum balance requirement refers to the least amount of money you can keep in the account on an ongoing basis. For instance, a bank may require your balance to stay at or above $100 or $1,000 for its account—or any other amount the bank prefers. Falling below the minimum requirement could mean being hit with a fee, or could instead mean you won't earn the high-yield interest rate on the account. So be sure the account you choose either has no minimum ongoing balance or one that you feel confident you can always stay above.\nMonthly maintenance fee: Banks and credit unions charge various types of fees. Unlike ones triggered by a transaction, such as an insufficient funds fee or a wire transfer fee, the monthly service fee is a standard fee you could be charged every statement cycle. Many accounts do not have a monthly maintenance fee, while some others provide ways for you to avoid the fee each month. Be sure you understand the fee rules for any account you're considering.\nMobile check deposit: The ability to deposit checks using the camera on your smartphone or tablet—rather than having to take the check to a branch—is called mobile check deposit or remote check deposit. Most institutions' mobile apps offer this as an easy way to get money deposited into your account.\nExternal or ACH transfer: The electronic process of moving funds between two financial institutions is called an external or ACH transfer. Virtually every high-yield savings account allows you to send or receive external transfers so that you can easily move money in and out of your savings account.\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account \nAfter comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here's how that generally works: \nThe bank or credit union will ask you to provide various personal information, including your social security number, since your interest earnings will be reportable to the IRS.\nThe bank's account opening process will also involve security measures designed to ensure you are who you say you are.\nYou'll also be presented with one or more options on how to fund your account. The most common method is by ACH transfer from another bank, and you'll be provided with instructions on how to set this up.\nAlternatively, some institutions allow you to make your initial deposit with a debit card, a credit card, or even a paper check sent through the mail.\nOnce the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened. \nTransfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won’t run into trouble if you can’t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days.\nPros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts \nPros\nHigher APY than traditional savings accounts\nAbility to withdraw or deposit funds at any time\nExtremely safe, with virtually no risk\nExcellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal\nIn times of rising rates, your APY may go up\nCons\nEarning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution\nSome accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month\nEasy access can make it tempting to dip into savings\nAccount could have a fee or minimum balance requirement\nIn times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down\nWho Is a High-Yield Savings Account Best For? \nAnyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially high annual percentage yield (APY). High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone. \nWhen choosing the best savings account for you, you'll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you'll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it's a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government—up to $250,000 per depositor—should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank's customer service may also prove useful. \nAlternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts \nHigh-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several alternatives for holding your funds until you need them.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Checking Account\nWhile the easiest place to keep surplus funds is in your checking account, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest—or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money. \nSome high-yield or rewards checking accounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops—sometimes every month—in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you're a heavy debit card user, one of the best rewards checking accounts may be a good option for you. \nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Traditional Savings Account \nThere is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as \"high yield\". In short, it's up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules. \nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Money Market Account \nA money market account operates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances—including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among the top-paying money market accounts. \nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Certificate of Deposit (CD) \nIf some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with a certificate of deposit. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD’s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs can lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre High-Yield Savings Accounts Safe?\nSome people wonder if you can lose money in a high-yield savings account. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don't grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you've been assessed. So it's important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees.\nAs for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks—whether physical or online—are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails.6 The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).7\nThat means whether your institution is a traditional brick-and-mortar bank with branches or is an online bank or credit union, and whether it’s big or small, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected.\nWho Has the Highest-Paying High-Yield Savings Account?\nThe top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank perpetually leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today's highest rates—currently well above 5%—and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of the best banks for savings accounts.\nWhich Banks Are Paying 7% Interest on High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nWhile it would be nice to earn 7% on money held in savings, no banks or credit unions are paying that much on a regular savings account. The only account paying a 7% APY right now is a savings account for kids, but only on balances up to $1,000.8 Savings account rates surged in 2023 and 2024, thanks the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign. But at its highest point, the top savings account rate available to anyone in the country reached 5.55% APY in April 2024.\nWhy Don't I Recognize the Banks in Your Rankings?\nWe track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks—including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank—their rates aren't usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren't available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY.\nHow Much Does a High-Yield Savings Account Get Taxed?\nWhat any bank offers in interest—whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account—will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You'll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources.\nThe bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return.\nDo High-Yield Savings Account Rates Change?\nThe APY on a savings account is variable, meaning what it pays when you first open your account will most likely change sometime in the future, and it can change at any time without warning.\nWhether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction.\nThat said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time.\nCan You Ever Lose Money With High-Yield Savings Account?\nThe risk of losing money in a high-yield savings account is very low. Banks and credit unions are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable, but they are guaranteed based on the balance in the account (the bank won't take that money back after paying it to you). So if you're worried that a high-yield savings account comes with the same risk as investing in the stock market, think again. These accounts are much safer and there's virtually no risk of losing money in the account (unless you spend it of course).\nWhat Are the Downsides to a High-Yield Savings Account?\nThere are few drawbacks to putting some of your money into a high-yield savings account. The primary downside is that your money will likely reside at a different institution than where you do your primary banking. As a result, you may not be able to instantaneously transfer money from your high-yield savings to your primary checking account, as transfers between banks generally take 1-3 days.\nThis issue can be easily handled, however, by making sure you keep some level of cash cushion at the bank where you have your checking, enabling you to make a quick transfer to checking if you need it.\nWhich Banks Do You Track for High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nEvery business day, we check the savings account rate for about 100 banks and credit unions that offer their accounts to customers nationwide.

We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage rate (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. \nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms. \nFor more about how we choose the best high-yield savings accounts, read our full methodology.\nLearn More About High-Yield Savings Accounts \nWhat Is a High-Yield Savings Account?\nWhat Is an APY?\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nBest High-Yield Business Savings Accounts\nBest Banks for Savings Accounts\nHow Many Savings Accounts Should I Have?\nWhy Choose a Money Market Instead of a Savings Account\nBest Money Market Accounts\nBest Online Banks\nSavings Account vs. Roth IRA: What's the Difference?\nInvestopedia / Alice Morgan\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

  "text": "Budgeting & Savings\nBudgeting & Savings\nFrequently Asked Questions\nBudgeting is the act of putting together a budget, which is an estimate of your revenue and expected expenses for a given time period. Savings refers to the money left over after your expenses are subtracted from your revenue, also within a specific time period. By creating a budget, you may be able to locate and cut any unnecessary expenditures, thereby increasing your savings.\nBy keeping tabs on your expenses and giving yourself a plan to follow, budgeting makes it easier to meet your financial goals. Savings, meanwhile, are important because living paycheck to paycheck isn’t viable in the long-term. If you are unable to accumulate savings, you could be in serious financial trouble in the event of an unexpected expense, such as a large medical bill.\nThe first step to budgeting is determining your net income (i.e., your total salary minus taxes and employer-provided programs) for a given time period. The next step is to figure out your fixed and variable expenses for the same period of time. You can then either decide how to utilize any surplus funds or find ways to reduce your expenses if they exceed your income. There are several budgeting plans available that can help you allocate an appropriate amount of money to each type of expense.\nThe 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting technique that was created by Senator Elizabeth Warren. The idea is that people will be able to more easily achieve greater financial stability by dividing specific shares of their spending between distinct categories. The three categories of the 50/30/20 rule are: 50% allocated to needs (i.e., rent, healthcare, etc.), 30% to wants (i.e., travel, entertainment, etc.), and 20% toward savings/debt (i.e., retirement, student loan payments, etc.).1\nKey Terms\nDiscretionary Income\nDiscretionary income refers to a portion of an individual’s income that can be spent, invested, or saved after paying for personal necessities and taxes. In this context of discretionary income, “spending” is specifically for nonessential goods and services, such as jewelry or entertainment. Although credit cards can usually be used to purchase nonessential goods and services, accruing personal debt isn’t the same thing as having a discretionary income.\nBudget\nA budget is an estimate of what a person earns and spends within a specific time period (i.e., monthly, etc.). Budgets are useful tools for giving you a clearer picture of your finances and helping you identify any unnecessary or excessive expenditures. A budget also makes it easier to determine the timeline for long-term saving goals by calculating how much surplus savings you would have after a certain amount of time.\nSavings\nSavings refers to an amount of money remaining from an individual or household’s disposable income after paying all of their expenses and obligations for a specific time period (i.e., monthly, etc.). Savings includes both cash as well as cash equivalents, such as bank account holdings. Although savings can be put toward many different long-term life goals, it’s also crucial to have enough saved up for emergencies.\nFinancial Health\nFinancial health refers to the current state of a person’s monetary assets and liabilities. Although each person's financial circumstances are different, there are rough guidelines that can be used to measure anyone’s financial health. A financially healthy individual may have a steady flow of income, consistent expenses, and regularly increasing savings.\nInflexible Expense\nAn inflexible expense is a recurring expense that typically cannot be altered or eliminated. Inflexible expenses are often set at a fixed amount and payment schedule, such as a monthly rent payment. In addition to current sources of income, lenders closely examine monthly expenses when considering applicants for personal loans, mortgages, or auto loans.\nQuality of Life\nQuality of life refers to a non-financial measurement generally associated with job and life satisfaction. A person’s quality of life is highly subjective to their personal experience, though it is often tied to financial security (among other factors). The potential tradeoff between money and quality of life is typically taken into account when considering things like a career or a personal savings plan.\nShowrooming\nShowrooming is the act of visiting brick-and-mortar retailers in order to see products in person before buying them online for a cheaper price. This practice allows customers to try out an item before making a decision to buy it while also finding the best price, which also gives an edge to online retailers. Brick-and-mortar stores have used multiple different marketing tactics to combat showrooming.\nAverage Propensity to Consume\nThe average propensity to consume (APC) is a measurement of how much of an individual’s income is spent rather than saved. The APC is calculated by dividing average household consumption (i.e., spending) by average household income (i.e., earnings). On a broader economic level, a high APC can be a sign of a healthy economy, since consumer spending drives economic growth.\nExplore Budgeting & Savings\nFinancial Advisors’ Advice for Millennials\nWhat Is Personal Finance Management (PFM), How Is It Used?\nBest Online Bookkeeping Classes\nHow to Open a Compound Interest Account\n8 Financial Tips for Young Adults\nWhere to Exchange Currency Without Paying High Fees\nCalculate Your Debt-to-Income Ratio\nWhat Is the Cheapest Time to Book a Flight?\nFinancial Health: Definition and How to Measure and Improve It\nDissaving: What It is, Reasons for it, Example\nWhat Is a Cost of Living Index?\n5 Things You Shouldn’t Do During a Recession\nUnderstand the Different Types of Inflation\nShould You Take Money from Your 401(k) or Borrow from Your Parents When You're Unemployed? \nWomen Should Plan for 100-Year Life: Merrill\nThe 5 U.S. Cities With the Highest Minimum Wage\nThe 2 Best Alternatives to Quicken Software \nSocial Commerce: Definition, Tactics, and Examples\n5 U.S. Cities Where Your Paycheck Goes the Furthest\nThe Most Popular Jobs for People 65 and Older\nHow to Fill Out a Money Order Step-by-Step\n4 Economic Concepts Consumers Need To Know\nHow Much Rent Can You Afford on $50K a Year?\nCaveat Emptor (Buyer Beware): What It Is, and What Replaced It\nHow to Use Mint: Budget Simply\nHow to Invest When You're Broke\nThe Worst Places to Exchange Currency\nPersonal Income Definition & Difference From Disposable Income\nWhat Is Discretionary Income?

  "text": "Policy Pages\nEditorial Policy \nUpdated Feb 6, 2023 \nOur mission is to simplify complex financial information and decisions so that our readers have the confidence to manage every aspect of their financial life. Your financial life is filled with personal decisions and challenges. Whether you are investing as a beginner or expert, planning your retirement, buying a home, studying for an exam in business school, or running a small business you have questions that need answering. \nFor over 20 years, we’ve helped hundreds of millions of people do just that. We feel it’s important to share how we go about writing all of the articles that you depend on. \nAt Investopedia we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.\nPrinciples \nEmpowering: Finance can be complex and intimidating. We provide you with information that you can use with confidence, whatever your level of experience. \nUnbiased: From financial product recommendations to the financial implications of government policy we put things in context and provide all the facts. Our information is carefully researched and is not written to support any specific economic or political viewpoint. \nAccurate: Having accurate financial information, presented clearly and updated regularly is of the utmost importance to us. We seek out and work with the most qualified experts across every topic we cover. Any mistakes, inaccuracies or misrepresentations identified by our readers are investigated and corrected promptly. Please contact us for corrections. \nInclusive: We work to ensure that our content serves—and depicts with dignity and respect—people of different ages, nationalities, religions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, relationship statuses, physical and mental abilities, and family types. \nEthics \nWe are committed to following the Codes of Ethics of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing (SABEW). Our content is guided by and upholds the Society for Professional Journalists’ foundations of ethical journalism: being accurate and fair, minimizing harm, acting independently, and being accountable and transparent. We also uphold the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines on disclosures, where applicable. \nInvestopedia content is for informational purposes and is not intended to substitute for the advice of a licensed or certified attorney, accountant, financial advisor, or other certified financial professionals. \nEditorial Process \nOur staff of editors and network of expert contributors write and manage all the articles you find on Investopedia. We don’t make recommendations for you to buy, sell, or hold securities or investments. We do, however, provide relevant analysis, context, insights, and educational information to help you make smarter, better-informed decisions. Wherever possible we provide examples that help put complex topics and concepts into perspective. \nOur editorial team is continually evaluating the articles across our site to flag any that contain information that is known to be or is likely to be out-of-date. Such articles are reviewed and updated or, if necessary, completely rewritten, rechecked, and re-edited. Our network of experienced experts, who uphold our process and policies, assist with our updating efforts. Articles that have been updated are date-stamped to reflect this. \nQuality Standards \nEvery article you see has multiple people behind it, continually working to make sure that it is responsible, accurate, understandable, helpful, and reflective of our editorial principles. \nOur editorial team approves all story ideas independently, and our expert contributors each have deep subject matter expertise in the topics that we assign them. Our team of professional editors, fact checkers, and producers review content to ensure it upholds our values of being empowering, inclusive, unbiased, and accurate. \nAll staff are responsible for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest. \nCorrections \nInvestopedia is committed to telling readers when an error has appeared, and to correcting it. This transparency applies to small and large mistakes, including news, but only if an error was made at the time of original publication. Corrections will be clearly noted on the page. When our journalism is factually correct, but the language is not as clear or detailed as necessary, the story may be updated without an editor's note. Please report possible errors to inv_editorial@investopedia.com. \nWriters \nInvestopedia experts are carefully recruited, vetted, and chosen. Some are experienced financial writers, others are experts in particular aspects of finance; many are both. They are selected for their knowledge and their skill at communicating complex topics in clear, accessible, actionable language. \nEvery article’s author or reviewer is listed at the top of the page, to the left of the date, and is linked to their biography, which you can click on to learn more about their credentials, education, professional experience, and social media presence. \nAll writers are required to uphold the editorial guidelines listed above. \nThird-Party Content \nThird-party content is carefully reviewed by the Investopedia editorial team to ensure that it is aligned with our policies and standards. Any such content is labeled clearly and conspicuously to notify you of its source. \nWarranty and Liability Disclaimer \nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only and should not be considered individual investment advice or recommendations to invest in any security or adopt any investment strategy. Though we believe the information provided herein is reliable, we do not warrant its accuracy or completeness. The views and strategies described in our content may not be suitable for all investors. Because market and economic conditions are subject to rapid change, all comments, opinions, and analyses contained within our content are rendered as of the date of the posting and may change without notice. The material is not intended as a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, region, market, industry, investment, or strategy. \nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and cryptocurrency-related content on Investopedia is not a recommendation to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs. Since each individual's situation is unique, a qualified professional should always be consulted before making any financial decisions. Investopedia makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or timeliness of the information contained herein.\nAdvertising Disclosure \nUpdated June 12, 2020 \nInvestopedia accepts advertising, but maintains a strict and clear separation between advertising and editorial content. Special attention is paid to featuring advertising in a way that will not interfere with your reading experience. This relates to both page design and to the number of ads we choose to feature on a page. \nInvestopedia maintains a distinct separation between advertising and editorial content. \nAll advertising or sponsored content on Investopedia is clearly and unambiguously distinguished from editorial content through borders or other distinguishing elements and/or identified as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.\nAll ads on Investopedia are labeled as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.\nAll \"native\" ads or paid content are identified as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.\nEditorial content on Investopedia is not influenced by advertisements unless the content is sponsored content, in which case, the content will be clearly demarcated and identified with the title \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" or \"Sponsored\", or a similar designation, indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of an advertiser or sponsor.\nIn some cases, editorial may include links to partners for which Investopedia receives an affiliate commission (See ‘How We Make Money’ for more details). The placement of these links is not influenced by payment, and editorial reserves the right to change, modify or remove them at any time in order to provide the best experience to users.\nHow We Make Money \nThe way that we're able to offer over 30,000 articles of great content on our website for free is by partnering with advertisers and affiliate partners who are looking to reach consumers. This can take a number of different forms, and we'll walk through those below. It's important to note that we maintain strict editorial independence for all of our content, particularly on reviews and recommendations. If a product is great, we'll tell you even if we don't have an advertising relationship. If we think a product is bad, we'll tell you that, even if we DO have an advertising relationship with them. While we do recommend and review products regardless of any advertising relationships, we may not have reviewed every product available in a given category. \nAffiliate Links to Advertisers \nIn some cases we may have an affiliate relationship with a product that we review, and so when you click on an \"Open Account\" button or sometimes a hyperlink on the product's name in those cases we may receive compensation either when you click on it it or if you decide to sign up for the product. Whether or not we have an advertiser in place does not change the placement of the button or whether there's a link for you to go to their website. \nExample of a broker review with a product card featuring an Open Account button, for which we may receive compensation when you click it or if you sign up for the product. \nComparison/Rate Tables Featuring Advertisers \nOn some review/recommendations we may include a comparison table of products that are offers from advertisers. While we do work hard with partners to try and surface the best paid offers possible in these comparison tables, it's important to note that they are NOT editorially selected. Here's an example of what that can look like, notice the Advertising Disclosure link in the top right corner: \nComparison tables featuring advertisers will always have their own Advertising Disclosure on them. \nDisplay Ads \nSome review/recommendations may include display advertising on them, which will be labelled as advertisements and are easily recognized. \nExample of traditional display advertisements on a bank review. \nPrivacy Policy \nUpdated September 27, 2021 \nAt Investopedia, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of users.

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. \nHow to Contact Us \nIf you have questions about this policy or about our privacy practices, you may contact us by emailing privacy@investopedia.com. \nIf you are a California resident inquiring about your California privacy rights, please include “California privacy rights request” in the subject line of your email. \nIf you are a resident of the European Economic Area inquiring about your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), please include “GDPR privacy rights request” in the subject line of your email. \nYou may also write to: \nInvestopedia Privacy \n28 Liberty Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10005 \nDispute Resolution \nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. \nJurisdiction Specific Provisions \nCalifornia Privacy Notice \nThis California Consumer Act Privacy Notice (\"CCPA Notice\") applies to \"Consumers\" as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"). For the purpose of this CCPA Notice, personal information applies to “Personal Information” as defined by the CCPA (also referred to herein as \"PI\"). \nWe collect and share the following categories of PI from the corresponding sources and for the corresponding purposes set forth in the table below. \nIn addition, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law, or as directed by you, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. \nWe do not knowingly \"sell\" personal information that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of \"sell\" in the CCPA, and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a do not sell request. There is not yet a consensus as to whether third-party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites and mobile apps may constitute a \"sale\" of your PI as defined by the CCPA. You can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser. We also list cookies and provide access to their privacy information and, if available, opt-out programs in our Cookie Policy. Further, you can learn more about your choices regarding certain kinds of online interest-based advertising with the Digital Advertising Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative. We do not represent that these third-party tools, programs or statements are complete or accurate. \nSome browsers have signals that may be characterized as do not track signals, but we do not understand them to operate in that manner or to indicate a do not sell expression by you, so we currently do not recognize these as a do not sell request. We understand that various parties are developing do not sell signals and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate. \nCalifornia Consumers have the right to exercise the privacy rights under the CCPA. California Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (\"Verifiable Consumer Request\"). We will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. In order to verify your identity, we will send you an email to the email address that you provide to us, and you must take action as described in our email. This will enable us to verify that the person who made the request controls and has access to the email address associated with the request. We will check our systems for the email address that you provide, and any information associated with such email address. If you provide us with an email address that has not been used to interact with us, then we will not be able to verify your identity. In other words, the only reasonable method by which we may verify the identity of individuals is if we have an email address on file that was provided to us in relation to our services. We will be unable to fulfill your request if we cannot verify your identity. Please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here and respond to any follow up inquiries we may make. \nSome personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer's personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. \nWe will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. \nTo make a request according to your rights to know or to request deletion of your PI set forth below, please click here, where you will find a description of the process we use to verify your request and any information that we will need to confirm your identity. In order to verify your identity, we will send you an email to the email address that you provide to us, and you must take action as described in our email. This will enable us to verify that the person who made the request controls and has access to the email address associated with the request. We will check our systems for the email address that you provide, and any information associated with such email address. If you provide us with an email address that has not been used to interact with us, then we will not be able to verify your identity. In other words, the only reasonable method by which we may verify the identity of individuals is if we have an email address on file that was provided to us in relation to our services. We will be unable to fulfill your request if we cannot verify your identity. \nFor your specific pieces of information, as required by the CCPA, we will apply heightened verification standards, which may include a request to provide further information. \nYou have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date: \nThe categories of PI we have collected about you.\nThe categories of sources from which we collected your PI.\nThe business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your PI.\nThe categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.\nThe specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.\nA list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.\nA list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred. If we sold your PI, we will explain:The categories of your PI we have sold.\nThe categories of third parties to which we sold PI, by categories of PI sold for each third party.\nYou have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining. \nPlease note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request. \nExcept to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you. \nYou may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by instead exercising one of the following more limited opt-outs, including unsubscribing from email newsletters. \nWe will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly. \nOur Notice to Nevada Residents \nUnder Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of certain “covered information” collected by operators of websites or online services.

If you do not wish your account to renew automatically or want to change or terminate your subscription, please email academysupport@investopedia.com. To use the Investopedia subscription service you must have internet access and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. \nBilling: Unless you cancel your subscription(s) before your monthly billing date, you authorize us to charge your next month’s subscription fee to your Payment Method. You also authorize Investopedia to charge you for any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your subscription payments. Such fees will be charged on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your subscription. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paid subscription began on a day not contained in a given month. In order to see your next payment date, please contact us at academysupport@investopedia.com. \nPayment Methods and Subscriptions: In order to enroll in an Investopedia paid subscription service you must provide one or more Payment Methods.

  "text": "Financial Technology & Automated Investing\nGuide to Financial Technology\nFrequently Asked Questions\nFintech is a portmanteau of the words “financial” and “technology,” and refers to technologies used in the financial sector of the economy. This includes things such as online banking apps, online stock brokerages, and mobile payment apps.\nMoore’s law is a name given to a prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors that could be put on a computer chip would roughly double every 2 years. This trend held true for several decades after it was made in the 1960’s, and the exponential increase in transistor density has continued, albeit, not at the same rate.\nQuantum computing is a field of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to change the way computers store and process information. Specifically, instead of data being stored as bits, which are individual units of binary code, they would be stored as Qubits (a portmanteau of “quantum” and “bits”). Qubits would be able to be in a quantum superposition of being both 0 or 1, which would allow significantly great processing capability.\nOpen banking, is a practice that involves the sharing of financial data between financial service providers through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs). This practice could potentially open up new options to consumers and/or significantly compromise individuals' data security and privacy.\nKey Terms\nCost Per Click (CPC)\nCost per click (CPC) is a model that some websites use to bill advertisers who advertise on their sites. It charges advertisers a certain amount, the aforementioned CPC, per time a visitor to the website clicks on the ad displayed there. Some sites use a different model which charges advertisers per certain number of people, usually 1000, who see an ad. That model is called “cost per mile.”\nMobile Commerce\nMobile commerce, also known as m-commerce, is the use of smartphones, cell phones, and similar mobile devices to make commercial transactions. This can include purchasing items or paying bills.\nInsurtech\nInsurtech is a portmanteau of “insurance” and “technology,” and refers to the technology used by the insurance industry. Examples include mobile apps through which people can purchase insurance.\nQR Code\nA quick response (QR) code is a kind of barcode that can be read easily by a computer. It stores information in a square-shaped grid, rather than a series of lines like a conventional barcode.\nMaterial Requirements Planning (MRP)\nMaterial requirements planning (MRP) is an inventory management system that uses software to keep track of and manage a business’s inventory and supply chain. It requires significant initial costs and high-quality data, but can increase supply chain efficiency if those requirements are met.\nMobile banking\nMobile banking is when banking services are used via mobile devices such as smartphones.\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU)\nGPUs are a particular type of computer chip that is specialized at creating computer graphics. They were traditionally used to allow computers to play games and do 3D art and design. However, the kind of mathematics involved in computer graphics is of a similar type to the kind used to mind Bitcoin and train AIs, so the demand for GPUs has risen substantially in recent years as new uses have emerged.\nExplore FinTech\nWhat Is a Virtual Assistant, and What Does One Do?\nHow to Automate Your Investing\nOverview of Insurtech & Its Impact on the Insurance Industry\nCost Per Click (CPC) Explained, With Formula and Alternatives\nOpen Banking: Definition, How It Works, and Risks\nThe Rise of the Computer-Built ETF\nMobile Payment: Payments Made From a Smartphone or Tablet\nElectronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval: Overview, FAQ\nConstant Ratio Plan: Meaning, Types, History\nHow Does Zola Make Money?\n5 Notable Bain Capital Investments\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA): Definition and Benefits\nWhat Is a Black Box Model?

  "text": "10 Best Life Insurance Companies for November 2024\nAccording to our in-depth research of 45 providers, we rank Nationwide as the best life insurance company. Life insurance provides money to your loved ones when you die, allowing them to cover your final expenses, replace your income, and pay off your debts. To choose the best providers, we researched 70 criteria, including price, policy types, financial stability, customer satisfaction, and the application process. While Nationwide was the best overall, other top insurers stood out in other categories. \nDedicated to helping you find the right life insurance provider for your needs, Investopedia conducts data-driven reviews that are written by life insurance experts who follow strict editorial guidelines. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best life insurance companies since 2020 with our unbiased, accurate, and comprehensive reviews. \n10 Best Life Insurance Companies for November 2024 \nBest Overall, Best Children’s Life Insurance, Best for People Over 50: Nationwide \nBest Term Life Insurance: Banner by Legal & General \nBest Whole Life Insurance: Lafayette Life \nCheapest Term Premiums: SBLI \nBest No-Medical-Exam Insurance: Penn Mutual \nBest for Financial Strength, Best for Customer Satisfaction: Thrivent \nBest for Universal Life: Pacific Life \nAlso Great for No-Medical-Exam Life Insurance: Symetra \nAlso Great for Children’s Life Insurance: Protective Life \nAlso Great for Whole Life Insurance: MassMutual \nBest Overall, Best Children’s Life Insurance, Best for People Over 50 : Nationwide \nFinancial Strength Rating: A+\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nBest Overall \nNationwide is an excellent all-around provider of life insurance, with the widest range of product types and coverage limits, plus outstanding customer satisfaction ratings and a very good financial strength rating from AM Best. On top of that, it offers three living benefit riders for no extra charge. \nBest Life Insurance for Children \nNationwide has no coverage limits on children’s whole life, so you can buy as much protection as you can afford. You can also transfer the policy to your child when they’re grown. And if you buy a child term rider, the policy can be converted to a permanent life insurance policy at adulthood. \nBest Life Insurance for People Over 50 \nBesides all of the things that make this a great policy for applicants of any age, we like that Nationwide offers no-medical-exam coverage of up to $1.5 million. It also has a final expense policy with no minimum issue age and a coverage limit of $50,000. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nExcellent selection of product types\nSuperior financial strength rating (A+)\n3 living benefits at no extra cost\nGreat child life insurance features\nFew customer complaints\nCons\nDoesn’t pay dividends on whole life policies\nOnly sells term life up to age 70\nNo live chat for customer service\nCan’t start insurance claims online\nOverview \nWhatever kind of life insurance you want, there’s a good chance it’s available at Nationwide. It has one of the widest selections of product types among the insurance companies we reviewed. It's also among the very best providers of riders that let you customize coverage, along with Ameritas and Brighthouse Financial. On top of that, Nationwide has a good customer service record, as shown by its National Associations of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) complaint index and the fact that it was ranked No. 4 out of 22 insurers in the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Individual Life Insurance Study.1 \nIn addition, Nationwide policies include free living benefits. Your policy pays out while you’re alive if you develop a critical, chronic, or terminal illness. \nNationwide only has a couple of minor flaws. It doesn’t pay whole life dividends. And it only sells term coverage up until age 70. Nationwide was founded in 1925 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nWhole life\nChildren’s whole life\nUniversal life\nIndexed universal life\nVariable universal life\nNo-medical-exam life (term)\nFinal expense \nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nChild term\nGuaranteed insurability rider\nWaiver of premium\nAccidental death benefit\nTerminal illness\nLong-term care\nChronic illness\nCritical illness\nBest Term Life Insurance : Banner by Legal & General \nBanner Life\nFinancial Strength Rating: A+\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nBest Term Life Insurance \nBanner Life Insurance Company’s term life insurance policies have low premiums and terms lasting up to 40 years. Coverage options start at $100,000 and have no upper limit. We like that Banner's term policies are renewable annually, and you can convert them to a permanent plan at no extra cost. The company also lets you get a quote and apply for a policy online. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nCompetitive premiums for term life insurance\nSells 40-year term policies\nNo max coverage limit for no-exam policies\nCons\nLimited selection of permanent policies\nFew riders available\nNo live chat\nOverview \nBanner by Legal & General could be a fine choice if you want temporary term life insurance coverage. It has some of the most competitive prices among the companies that gave us quotes, and it allows you to apply online. It is also the only insurer on our list besides Protective Life selling 40-year term policies that can last your entire working life. Most insurers limit you to 30 years. \nBanner Life falls short on product selection, though. Besides term, it only sells universal life and doesn’t provide many riders to customize coverage. Banner Life is headquartered in Frederick, Maryland, and its parent company, Legal & General, was founded in 1836. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nUniversal life\nNo-medical-exam life \nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nChild term\nWaiver of premium\nTerminal illness\nBest Whole Life Insurance : Lafayette Life \nLafayette Life Insurance\nFinancial Strength Rating: A+\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nBest Whole Life Insurance \nWith a wide selection of whole life policy options, high coverage limits, and many rider benefits included free of charge, Lafayette Life is our top pick for whole life insurance. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nMany types of whole life insurance\nNo limit for whole life coverage\nPays whole life dividends\nIncludes 3 free living benefit riders\nCons\nNo online quotes or application\nDoesn’t offer universal or variable life\nOnly pays average dividends\nOverview \nLafayette Life is our top choice for whole life insurance policies. It sells seven different whole life products, allowing you to customize your coverage to suit your needs. There’s also no limit on how much whole life insurance coverage you can buy. Finally, Lafayette Life includes many rider benefits at no extra charge, such as riders that let you use your death benefit for medical care while you’re alive if you get a chronic, critical, or terminal illness. \nWhile Lafayette Life pays whole life dividends, its dividend interest rate is lower than that of competitors such as MassMutual and Guardian Life. You must also call or meet an agent in person to sign up; you can’t enroll online. Lafayette Life, founded in 1905, is based in Cincinnati. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nWhole life\nChildren’s whole life\nNo-medical-exam life (whole life)\nFinal expense\nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nChild term\nGuaranteed insurability rider\nWaiver of premium\nAccidental death benefit\nTerminal illness\nChronic illness\nCritical illness\nCheapest Term Premiums : SBLI \nSBLI Life Insurance\nFinancial Strength Rating: A\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nCheapest Term Premiums \nSBLI combines low premiums for term insurance with a good customer service record, making it an ideal choice for someone on a budget. And it lets you convert your term policy to a permanent plan at no additional cost. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nCheap term premiums\nExcellent online features and tools\nFew customer complaints\nCons\nNo universal or variable life insurance\nLow whole life dividend rate\nOverview \nIf you’re looking for a deal on term life insurance, consider SBLI. It quoted some of the lowest overall premiums for term policies of all the companies we researched. Yet SBLI does not appear to skimp on service. It has a low number of customer complaints to state regulators, given its size. At the same time, SBLI offers excellent online capabilities, including online quotes, an online application, and live chat. \nIf you want a permanent policy, SBLI might not be the best choice. It doesn’t sell universal or variable life policies, it has a small rider selection, and it pays a low whole life dividend rate. SBLI was founded in 1907 and is based in Woburn, Massachusetts. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nWhole life\nChildren’s whole life\nNo-medical-exam life (term and whole life)\nFinal expense\nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nChild term\nGuaranteed insurability rider\nWaiver of premium\nAccidental death benefit\nTerminal illness\nBest No-Medical-Exam Insurance : Penn Mutual \nFinancial Strength Rating: A+\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nBest No-Medical Exam Insurance \nPenn Mutual customers can apply for coverage worth up to $10 million without a medical exam, more than any other company we reviewed.\nPros & Cons \nPros\nHigh coverage limit for no-exam policies\nWhole life policyholders are eligible for a dividend and the dividend rate has been high\nExcellent customer complaint record\nCons\nNo online application or quotes\nNo final expense insurance\nNo live chat for customer service\nOverview \nPenn Mutual has the highest coverage limit for no-medical-exam insurance among the companies we reviewed. You can get a policy worth up to $10 million through its accelerated underwriting program. \nThe company, founded in 1847 and based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, has paid dividends to policyholders for 175 straight years, reaching a high of $200 million in 2024.2 The dividend interest rate of 5.75% was among the highest of the companies we reviewed. Penn Mutual has an excellent NAIC index, indicating that customers have made few complaints relative to the company's size. \nBut if you want to shop for life insurance online, Penn Mutual doesn't offer the digital quoting and application features that many of its competitors do. You need to speak to an agent to buy its products. And while it has a wide product selection, it doesn't sell smaller, more affordable policies to cover final expenses.\nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nWhole life\nChildren's whole life\nUniversal life\nIndexed universal life\nVariable universal life\nNo-medical-exam life\nAvailable Riders \nSpouse rider\nGuaranteed insurability rider\nAccidental death benefit\nTerminal illness rider\nChronic illness rider\nChildren's term rider\nWaiver of premium rider\nBest for Financial Strength, Best for Customer Satisfaction : Thrivent \nThrivent\nFinancial Strength Rating: A++\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Financial Strength \nThrivent received an A++ rating from A.M. Best for its financial strength, the highest score possible. But Thrivent is a member-owned organization for Christians. It asks that only Christians or their spouses apply. \nBest for Customer Satisfaction \nThrivent had the best three-year average score for customer complaints to state regulators of any of the companies we researched—though MassMutual is a very close second. Thrivent’s average NAIC index was 0.73, far better than expected for a company of its size. MassMutual’s was 0.75. (An index of 1.0 indicates a company received about as many complaints as expected for its size.) \nPros & Cons \nPros\nA++ financial strength rating\nBest complaint score of any company we reviewed\nGood policy selection\nCons\nOnly available to applicants who declare themselves Christians\nNo online applications\nLimited rider selection\nNo child term rider\nOverview \nAM Best reviews insurance companies based on their financial strength. It gave Thrivent an A++ rating, the highest score possible. This shows that Thrivent is in an excellent position to pay out its claims and benefits. Thrivent also excels at satisfying customers. Of the more than 40 companies we reviewed, it received the fewest customer complaints relative to its size. Thrivent offers a broad range of life insurance types, including term, whole life, and universal. \nStill, the company has a few drawbacks. The main one is its limited membership—it is only open to Christians. Also, you can’t apply for policies online and must speak with an agent. Thrivent has fewer riders than other top competitors and is noticeably missing a child term rider. \nThrivent was founded in 1902 and is located in Minneapolis. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nWhole life\nChildren’s whole life\nUniversal life\nVariable universal life\nNo-medical-exam life (term)\nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nGuaranteed insurability rider\nWaiver of premium\nTerminal illness\nBest for Universal Life : Pacific Life \nPacific Life\nFinancial Strength Rating: A+\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Universal Life \nPacific Life's universal life insurance (UL) selection stands out because the company offers all the main variations of UL (indexed universal, variable universal) and multiple product choices for each one. There’s also a large group of riders to choose from and the UL coverage range is wide, with policies as small as $25,000 and essentially no maximum limit. Finally, we like that you can also add a child term rider to UL policies. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nSells all the variations of universal life\nNo maximum coverage limits\nGreat customer satisfaction rating\nCons\nNo online quotes or applications\nNo whole life insurance\nOverview \nPacific Life specializes in more complex universal life insurance policies. It sells all three main variations: universal, indexed universal (IUL), and variable universal (VUL). Only a few other insurers, such as Nationwide, Prudential, and John Hancock, offer all three, and often they can’t match Pacific Life’s variety of product offerings. In some markets, Pacific Life has two different UL products, five VUL products, and four IUL products. \nHowever, Pacific Life requires you to meet a representative in person to discuss these complex products; you can’t apply online. Pacific Life also does not sell whole life insurance. Pacific Life launched in 1868 and is based in Newport Beach, California. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nUniversal life\nIndex universal life\nVariable universal life\nNo-medical-exam life \nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nChild term\nWaiver of premium\nDisability income\nTerminal illness\nLong-term care\nChronic illness\nAlso Great for No-Medical-Exam Life Insurance : Symetra \nSymetra\nFinancial Strength Rating: A\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nAlso Great for No-Medical Exam Life Insurance \nSymetra sells policies worth up to $5 million that don’t require a medical exam, with rapid approval decisions. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nHigh limit for no-medical-exam life\nFast underwriting decisions\nHigh customer satisfaction\nCons\nLimited policy types\nSmall rider selection\nOverview \nIf you don’t want to take a medical exam, Symetra is another fine choice. You could qualify for up to $5 million of coverage with no exam, provided you can pass based on age, income, and medical records. Symetra lets you apply online and can make coverage decisions in minutes. \nWhile Symetra can be great for no-exam term life, it doesn’t offer much choice beyond that. It doesn’t sell whole life insurance or many policy riders. Symetra was founded in 1957 and is based in Bellevue, Washington. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nIndexed universal life\nVariable universal life\nNo-medical-exam life (term)\nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nChild term\nWaiver of premium\nAccidental death benefit\nTerminal illness\nAlso Great for Children’s Life Insurance : Protective Life \nProtective Life\nFinancial Strength Rating: A+\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nAlso Great for Children’s Life Insurance \nProtective offers the best term rider for covering children, making it a solid choice to protect your entire family at once. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nExtensive coverage for child term rider\nWhole life policies available with a death benefit as small as $1,000\nSells 40-year term life\nCons\nNo children’s whole life policies\nAll applications require a medical exam\nNo dividends for whole life policies\nOverview \nA child term rider adds insurance for your children to your life insurance policy. While other insurers offer this benefit, Protective stands out for having the best. Its rider covers your children until they turn 25. Your children can also take over the life insurance when they become adults and convert the temporary term insurance into permanent lifetime coverage. \nHowever, Protective Life does not sell a standalone child’s whole life policy. If you want to cover your child, you can only do so through a rider. Beyond child coverage, Protective has a wide selection of policies and riders. \nProtective Life launched in 1907 and has its headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nWhole life\nUniversal life\nIndex universal life\nVariable universal life\nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nChild term\nGuaranteed insurability rider\nWaiver of premium\nAccidental death benefit\nTerminal illness\nChronic illness\nAlso Great for Whole Life Insurance : MassMutual \nMassMutual\nFinancial Strength Rating: A++\nNAIC Complaint Rating: Much better than expected for company size\nWhy We Chose It \nAlso Great for Whole Life Insurance \nMassMutual stands out for paying the highest whole life dividend rate, helping grow the cash value for policyholders. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nGenerous whole life dividends\nSells whole life up until age 90\nGreat customer satisfaction rating\nCons\nNo online quotes or applications\nApplications require a medical exam\nNo same-day decisions\nOverview \nMassMutual is another solid option for a whole life insurance policy. It pays the highest dividend rate of all insurers on this list, giving policyholders solid risk-free growth for their cash value. MassMutual also sells whole life policies to people up to age 90, tied with Thrivent and Guardian Life for the highest age limit. \nYou can't apply online to take out a MassMutual policy; you must talk with an agent. All applications require a medical exam, and there are no same-day decisions. MassMutual launched in 1860 and is based in Springfield, Massachusetts. \nPolicy Types & Riders \nAvailable Policy Types \nTerm life\nWhole life\nChildren’s whole life\nUniversal life\nVariable universal life\nAvailable Riders \nTerm conversion\nSpouse rider\nGuaranteed insurability rider\nWaiver of premium\nDisability income\nTerminal illness\nChronic illness\nCompare the Best Life Insurance Companies \nCompany Star Rating Best For AM Best Rating NAIC Complaint Index Sample Term Cost* \nNationwide\t4.80\tBest Overall, Best Life Insurance for People Over 50, Best Children’s Life Insurance\tA+\t0.372\t$31.50\t\nBanner\t4.08\tBest Term Life Insurance\tA+\t0.341\t$27.96\t\nLafayette\t4.02\tBest Whole Life Insurance\tA+\t0.307\tN/A\t\nSBLI\t4.23\tCheapest Term Premiums\tA\t0.327\t$27.97\t\nPenn Mutual\t3.96\tBest No-Medical Exam Insurance\tA+\t0.109\t$28.29\t\nThrivent\t4.06\tBest for Financial Strength, Best for Customer Satisfaction\tA++\t0.073\t$26.66\t\nPacific Life\t3.86\tBest Universal Life Insurance\tA+\t0.086\t$28.02\t\nSymetra\t3.40\tAlso Great for No-Medical-Exam Life Insurance\tA\t0.337\t$27.98\t\nProtective\t4.27\tAlso Great for Children’s Life Insurance\tA+\t0.449\t$27.97\t\nMassMutual\t3.86\tAlso Great for Whole Life Insurance\tA++\t0.075\t$33.50\t\n*Sample term cost is based on quotes collected from Term4Sale, Quotacy, and individual company websites for a 30-year $250,000 term policy for male non-smokers born in 1984 with excellent health. It’s an average of quotes collected in ZIP codes 90011 and 77084. \nOur Expert Pick for the Best Life Insurance \nAll the companies on our list could be good for your coverage. The right option depends on what you’re looking for. Nationwide is our pick for best overall insurer thanks to its product selection, and it stands out as a top choice for covering children and people over 50. Protective Life is also a quality option for children’s life insurance, thanks to its child term rider. \nIf you want temporary term coverage—meaning for a few decades instead of your whole life—Banner Life has the best overall term policies, while SBLI charges the cheapest term premiums for most people. If you want permanent coverage, Lafayette and MassMutual are great options for whole life, while Pacific Life is best for universal. If you don’t want to have to take a medical exam while applying, consider Penn Mutual or Symetra. Finally, Thrivent stands out as the most financially stable, per the AM Best ratings, and it has the best customer satisfaction rating of all the companies we researched. \nWhat Are the Types of Life Insurance? \nThere are many types of life insurance, with differences based on how long the coverage lasts, the application process, and whether you get any living benefits (access to your cash value while you’re alive. Here are the main types on the market: \nTerm life insurance\nWhole life insurance\nUniversal life insurance \nNo-medical-exam life insurance\nWhat Is Term Life Insurance? \nTerm life insurance is temporary coverage. You buy a policy that lasts a set amount of time, such as five or 20 years. If you pass away during the term, your heirs receive the death benefit. If you outlive the term, your coverage ends. Term life insurance is the most affordable option. However, it is not guaranteed to last your entire life and doesn’t provide cash value. \nWhat Is Whole Life Insurance? \nWhole life insurance is guaranteed to last your entire life, provided you keep paying the premiums. The premiums are also guaranteed not to increase. Whole life insurance can build cash value with a guaranteed minimum return plus company dividends. Whole life insurance is more expensive than other policy types. \nWhat Is Universal Life? \nUniversal life is another type of permanent policy that can offer lifelong coverage. With universal life, you can change the premium payment each year. However, you must pay enough to keep up with life insurance costs. These policies give more flexibility but require more work to manage. \nUniversal life insurance policies also build cash value. Regular universal life insurance grows based on market interest rates. Your returns are somewhat unpredictable, though there is a minimum guaranteed return. \nWhat Is Indexed Universal Life Insurance (IUL)? \nIndexed universal life insurance grows your cash value based on the performance of some market index, like the S&P 500. However, there are limits on your possible gains and losses. Many IULs guarantee a minimum return in market downturns but cap your growth in good years. \nWhat Are Variable Universal Life (VUL) and Variable Life Insurance? \nVariable universal life and variable life both let you invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You have more upside potential than the other life insurance types but could lose money in your cash value during downturns. A VUL policy lets you adjust the premium payments yearly, whereas variable life charges steady premiums. \nWhat Is No-Medical-Exam Life Insurance? \nNo-medical-exam life insurance lets you apply for and potentially buy life insurance without getting a physical exam first. Instead, insurers decide to approve you based on other information like your medical and prescription records, driving record, and answers to questions on the application. \nNo-medical-exam life insurance has a faster, easier application process. However, there could be limits on the coverage amounts and policy types. In addition, premiums can be higher for some kinds of no-medical-exam life insurance, like guaranteed issue burial insurance, because they accept people with health issues. \nHow Much Does Life Insurance Cost? \nLife insurance costs depend on several factors, including the amount of coverage, features and benefits, your age, gender, overall health, family medical history, lifestyle, and the insurer you work with. You’ll need to apply to see precisely how much life insurance costs for you. \nThe type of coverage you buy also makes a big difference. Permanent policies like whole life insurance typically charge more than term life insurance policies for the same death benefit because the policy doesn’t expire as long as you pay your premiums, and it has a savings component (cash value) that grows as you age. Here are quotes from the top insurers in this article. \nTerm Life Policy Costs \nCompany Name 30-Year-Old Female 30-Year-Old Male 40-Year-Old Female 40-Year-Old Male 55-Year-Old Female 55-Year-Old Male \nNationwide\t$18.81\t$22.97\t$26.25\t$31.50\t$99.97\tn/a\t\nBanner\t$14.36\t$17.03\t$22.67\t$27.96\t$90.52\t$117.74\t\nLafayette\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\t\nSBLI\t$14.34\t$16.99\t$22.68\t$27.97\t$68.30\t$98.30\t\nPenn Mutual\t$14.53\t$17.23\t$22.94\t$28.29\t$82.11\t$119.13\t\nThrivent\t$15.70\t$18.92\t$26.66\t$21.93\t$86.86\t$121.05\t\nPacific Life\t$14.40\t$17.16\t$22.73\t$28.02\t$91.12\t$118.49\t\nSymetra\t$14.38\t$17.05\t$22.69\t$27.98\t$90.54\t$117.76\t\nProtective\t$14.37\t$17.04\t$22.68\t$27.97\t$90.53\t$117.45\t\nMassMutual\t$17.84\t$21.32\t$26.97\t$33.50\t$103.53\t$140.51\t\n*Life insurance quotes are examples only and were collected for 30-year $250,000 term life policies for non-smoking males and females in excellent health. They’re an average of prices from two ZIP codes: 90011 and 77084. \nTerm Life Policy Costs for Older Adults \nAs you age, the price of life insurance goes up. Older adults will usually get shorter terms, but still pay higher premiums than younger adults getting a longer term. The information below is for a 15-year term, versus the 30-year term quoted above. \nHow to Choose the Best Life Insurance Company \nYou shouldn’t work with just any company for your life insurance coverage. Follow these steps to make sure you do the right amount of research. \nDetermine your coverage needs: Before meeting with insurers, decide what you’ll need from your policy. Consider the amount of coverage you want, your budget, and whether you want any specialty features, like a child term rider or disability income coverage.\nDecide on the type of policy: Insurers often specialize in different policies. As you can see from the awards given in this article, some do better with term, others with whole life, etc.\nReview top-ranked insurers: Check the reviews of top insurers. Check their customer satisfaction, financial strength, and information from reviews like ours.\nGet multiple quotes: Life insurers provide free premium quotes. You could apply from your top candidates to see who comes through with the best offer.\nReview with a financial advisor: A financial advisor, especially a fee-only financial advisor, can give you an unbiased review of your options.\nFor more help, check out how to choose the best life insurance company. \nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia collected data points related to dozens of criteria that are important when choosing life insurance, across 45 companies.

When you sign up, you pick how much coverage you want. If you die while covered, the insurance company pays your heirs the death benefit. You must pay ongoing premiums to keep your life insurance policy active.\nDo I Need Life Insurance?\nYou may need life insurance if you have people depending on you, like a spouse or young children. It could replace your salary if you pass away unexpectedly. You may also need life insurance if you have large debts you’d like to cover for your family, like a mortgage, student loans, or final expenses. Finally, if you own a business, you could buy life insurance to protect your partners and cover the lives of key employees.\nIf you don’t have these needs now, consider whether they could come up in the future. You could set up life insurance to prepare now.\nWhat Are the Pros and Cons of Life Insurance?\nThe main pro of life insurance is that it can protect your heirs against the cost of your death. You can buy a large amount of coverage for a small premium using term life. Life insurance can also build wealth for the future using cash value.\nThe main con of life insurance is that it costs money. You must pay the premiums to stay protected. It’s possible to pay years of premiums and not receive a death benefit payout because your coverage ends before you pass away. \nSome permanent policies may also not be the best use of your funds. You may be better off getting an affordable term policy and investing the rest of your money rather than paying for a more expensive permanent policy.\nHow Can You Get Cheap Life Insurance?\nYou can get cheap life insurance by buying term life insurance, which is much more affordable than permanent coverage. You can focus on companies such as SBLI or Banner Life, which specialize in inexpensive policies. Get multiple quotes to see who offers you the best deal.\nWhat Is Burial Insurance?\nBurial insurance is a type of life insurance specifically designed to pay for funerals and other final expenses. These are whole life policies without an expiration date. Burial insurance is usually for small amounts of coverage, just enough to cover the cost of a funeral.3 These policies typically have easier underwriting without checking for health issues. However, they can be more expensive than regular life insurance for some buyers and can have limits on paying out if you pass away within the first few years of buying coverage. \nCompanies We Reviewed\nNationwide, Ameritas, Assurity, Protective, SBLI, Midland National, Banner, Thrivent, Lafayette, Penn Mutual, USAA, MassMutual, Mutual of Omaha, Columbus, Pacific Life, Guardian Life, Prudential, Equitable, Lincoln Financial, State Farm, AAA, Transamerica, John Hancock, North American, Western & Southern, Brighthouse, Securian, Farmers, Northwestern Mutual, Symetra, Foresters, Gerber, Minnesota Life, Fidelity, Mutual Trust Life Solutions, Corebridge Financial (formerly AIG), New York Life, Kansas City Life, Globe Life, Aflac, Boston Mutual, Bankers, American National, Colonial Penn, Allianz\nHow We Review the Best Life Insurance Companies \nTo compile our list of the best life insurance companies, Investopedia first conducted preliminary research on dozens of life insurance companies and determined that 45 met our minimum standard for financial strength, customer satisfaction, and online transparency.

  "text": "Personal Loans: The Complete Guide\nPersonal Loans\nFrequently Asked Questions\nPersonal loans are not counted as income and are therefore not subject to federal income tax. Interest on personal loans is not tax deductible as with mortgage loans, however. If personal loans are ever partially or completely discharged or forgiven as part of a personal bankruptcy or a debt restructuring the amount not paid will be considered income and will be subject to federal income tax.\nApplying for one or more personal loans can affect your credit score, as lenders must pull your full credit report before approving a loan in order to determine your creditworthiness. A full credit check, also known as a hard pull of your credit, can temporarily lower your credit score by a small amount. How you maintain the status of your personal loan also affects your credit score. If you make payments on time and in full it will help your credit score and if you don’t it will hurt your score.\nAs with taking on any type of debt, personal loans can present certain risks - the biggest being not being able to service the debt in the form of making monthly payments. This can lead to damaged credit, having the debt go into collections and potentially having to take drastic steps like declaring personal bankruptcy.\nCredit cards are similar to personal loans in that they are extensions of unsecured credit. However, personal loans are generally lump sum loans made by lenders to consumers with a specific repayment term and fixed interest rate. Credit cards are revolving lines of credit with balances that can be paid back over time if not paid in full each month.\nInterest rates on personal loans can vary significantly based on the credit score of the borrower as well as income level, amount borrowed and the lender involved. Most personal loans are made at fixed interest rates but variable interest rates that are indexed to the prime rate will likely become more common in a rising rate environment as lenders seek to keep consistent profit margins.\nFind the Best Personal Loan for You\nKey Terms\nSignature Loan—A Popular Type of Unsecured Loan\nA signature loan is a personal loan that can be used for any purpose and is offered by lenders to known borrowers with only their signature on the loan document as a form of collateral. Signature loans typically carry higher interest rates vs. loans that require physical collateral since they entail more risk to the lender.\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending is a type of social lending that allows borrowers to bypass the traditional financial system for getting loans and borrow directly from other individuals through P2P lending platforms like Prosper or Lending Club, which set the terms and interest rates of the loans based on borrower creditworthiness.\nCollateralization\nCollateralization is the process by which a loan is secured against default by pledging sufficiently valuable assets. If the borrower ever defaulted on a collateralized loan the lender could seize the pledged assets and sell them to recoup the loan loss.\nLawsuit Settlement Loan\nA lawsuit settlement loan is a type of short term lump sum loan made by a lender to a borrower who expects to receive a reward settlement as part of a class action lawsuit or personal injury lawsuit. Once a legal settlement is made to the borrower the loan is repaid with interest. Lawsuit settlement loans typically have higher interest rates compared to traditional personal loans.\nStretch Loan\nA stretch loan is a short-term form of borrowing meant to cover a shortfall in income. Stretch loans are similar to payday loans and carry higher interest rates than traditional personal loans that have longer repayment terms.\nCash Advance\nA cash advance is a very short term loan made through a bank, credit union, credit card issuer or non-traditional financial institution and is often used to cover immediate cash needs resulting from unexpected financial demands such as medical expenses or car repairs.\nPayday Loan\nPayday loans are a form of short term credit that are typically offered by non-traditional consumer finance companies and carry very high interest rates. The principal of payday loans can be a portion or more of the borrowers next paycheck. Payday loan interest rates are determined by the borrowers income but tend to be among the highest rates charged in the financial markets.\nExplore Personal Loans\nLoans",

  "text": "Brokers\nBest Brokers for 2024 \nInvestopedia’s experts put 26 companies through a rigorous evaluation process to identify the best online brokerages for you. We collected over 2,314 data points and used our subject matter expertise to develop a process for finding the best brokers, focusing on costs, range of offerings, trading technology, and more. \nWinners \nBest Overall: Fidelity\nBest for Low Costs: Fidelity\nBest for Beginners: Charles Schwab\nBest for Advanced Traders: Interactive Brokers\nBest for ETFs: Fidelity\nBest for Options Trading: tastytrade\nBest for International Trading: Interactive Brokers\nBest for Mobile Investing & Trading: E*TRADE\nBest for Cryptocurrency Trading: eToro\nBest for Risk Management: Interactive Brokers\nBest for Cash Management: Fidelity\nBest for Generating Stock Trading Ideas: Interactive Brokers\nBest for Algorithmic Trading: Interactive Brokers\nBest for Alternative Investments: Public\nGuide to Brokers\nFrequently Asked Questions\nBrokerage accounts are not FDIC-insured like deposit accounts at banks. Instead, the money you have in a brokerage account may be insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). The SIPC doesn't insure you against losses resulting from market activity or fraud. The SIPC will reimburse investors for up to $500,000, including $250,000 in cash, in the event of a firm's insolvency. The SIPC only covers member firms.\nYes. Because minors are not eligible to open their own brokerage account, parents and guardians can open and manage a custodial account in a child's name. Funding options for custodial accounts include cash, stocks, and mutual fund transfers. The process of opening a custodial account involves providing personal and banking information and completing a series of forms online.\nFind the best brokerage firm and account that satisfies your investing style and needs. Then evaluate how a brokerage can help you manage risk. Apply for and set up the account and then fund the account. Before investing your money in the brokerage account, consider educating yourself about how stocks and other investments work (remember, investing always comes with the risk of losing your principal deposit).\nBrokerage cash is a top-line cash total in your investing account. It's the cash amount before stripping out items like unsettled trades and collateral. Not all of your brokerage cash is immediately available for trading or withdrawing. That would be a bottom-line number which may be called buying power, cash available for withdrawal, or something similar. Cash in these accounts can be parked to collect interest, reinvested, or withdrawn for paying bills.\nBrokerage accounts are taxable investment accounts through which you can buy and sell stocks and other securities. IRAs are designed for retirement savers and allow tax-free or tax-deferred growth on the investments you hold in the account. Unlike brokerage accounts, IRAs have strict contribution limits, and withdrawals may trigger a penalty. Brokerage accounts and IRAs are taxed differently, which can be a deciding factor when choosing an account.\nKey Terms\nBrokerage Fee\nA brokerage fee is a fee a broker charges to execute transactions or provide services for clients. Brokerage fees are based on a percentage of the transaction, as a flat fee, or as a hybrid of the two, and vary according to the industry and type of broker.\nCross\nA cross is when a broker receives a buy and sell order for the same stock at the same price, and subsequently makes a simultaneous trade between two separate customers at that price. Variations of this are the market opening and market closing crosses\nBest Execution Rule\nBest execution is a legal mandate that requires brokers to seek the most favorable options to execute their clients' orders within the prevailing market environment. Best execution is a significant investor protection requirement that obligates a broker to exercise reasonable care when executing an order to obtain the most advantageous terms for the customer. It requires brokers to examine, track, and document when routing an equity investment, an option, or a bond order for execution.\nPayment for Order Flow\nPayment for order flow (PFOF) is the compensation a broker receives for routing trades to execute to a particular market maker.\nBuy Side\nThe buy side is a segment of financial markets made up of investing institutions that buy securities for money-management purposes. A business involved in buy-side activities will purchase stocks, bonds, and other financial products based on the needs and strategy of their company's or client's portfolio. Common buy-side institutions include hedge funds, pension funds, and mutual funds.\nDeep Discount Broker\nA deep discount broker is an agent who mediates trades on exchanges between securities buyers and sellers at even lower commission rates than those offered by a traditional discount broker.\nSell Side\nThe sell side is the part of the financial industry that is involved with the creation, promotion, and sale of stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments to the public market. The sell side can also include private capital market instruments such as private placements of debt and equity.\nJoint Brokerage Account\nA joint brokerage account is a type of investment account owned by two or more people. It allows multiple individuals to contribute funds toward investments and make trading decisions together. Joint brokerage accounts are commonly opened by married couples, siblings, or business partners who want to invest together and pool their resources.\nSoft Dollars\nSoft dollars are a means of paying brokerage firms for their services through commission revenue, as opposed to through hard-dollar direct payments.\nTrailing Commission\nA trailing commission is a fee you pay a financial advisor each year that you own an investment. The purpose of a trailing commission is to give an advisor an incentive to review a client's holdings and provide advice. It is essentially a reward for keeping you with a particular fund.\nHard Dollars\nHard dollars are cash fees or payments made by an investor or customer to a brokerage firm in return for their services. Hard dollar payments are usually set amounts that are known before a customer begins dealing with a broker. Hard dollar payments include set transaction charges, monthly account maintenance charges, as well as paying for research provided by the brokerage firm.\nExplore Brokers\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares on Webull\nHow to Trade Options on Webull\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares on Fidelity Investments\n6 Best Investment Accounts for Handling Uninvested Cash\nHow to Bet on the 2024 Presidential Election\nWhat Is a Cash Management Account?\nHow to Buy Fractional Shares\nHow to Automate Your Investing\nWho Insures Your Investment in the Stock Market\nHow to Invest in Web 3.0\nBy\nGloria Chinemerem Chimelu\nUpdated Jun 29, 2023 \nBest Ways to Earn Passive Income\nHow to Invest in Gold and Silver\nInteractive Brokers vs. Webull\nJ.P.

SoFi is one of the few lenders to offer a comprehensive benefits package with all of its loans, including free financial planning from an advisor and career counseling and support. \nBorrowers seem to approve of this approach, rating SoFi as the fourth-best in J.D. Power’s annual survey of customer satisfaction among personal loan lenders.1 The biggest downside of borrowing with SoFi is that with a minimum loan amount of $5,000, borrowers looking for a smaller loan are left out.2 And while you can apply with a co-borrower, SoFi doesn’t offer the option to apply with a co-signer or use collateral if you’re not able to be approved otherwise. \nSoFi was founded in 2011 and is based in San Francisco, California. It has funded more than $73 billion in loans of various types, including student loans and personal loans. \nCo-borrowers are jointly responsible from the beginning to repay the loan with you. Co-signers only repay the loan if you default, making it an easier sell to get someone on board with your loan.\nPros & Cons \nPros\nZero fees charged\nSame-day funding available\nAccess to SoFi membership benefits\nCons\nNo secured loan options\nCan’t apply with a co-signer, but co-borrowers are accepted\nHigh minimum loan amounts\nRequirements \nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nMust be at least 18 years old in most U.S. states\nMust have income or a job offer starting within 90 days\nMust be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or non-permanent resident\nLoans can’t be used for real estate, investments, businesses, or college financing.\nBest for Debt Consolidation : Discover \nAPR Range: 7.99% - 24.99% \nLoan Amount: $2,500 - $40,000 \nLoan Terms: 36 months - 84 months \nWhy We Chose It \nAs long as you’re not looking to consolidate any debt from a Discover card, a Discover personal loan is an excellent choice for debt consolidation. It offers a fast funding time with a next-business-day deposit into your bank account if everything goes smoothly, and its low rates with zero origination fees make it easier to pay back. It was ranked as the second-best personal loan option in 2024 by J.D. Power.1 \nThe downside is that you can only apply as a solo applicant, although you are able to use your household income on your application, so a partner or other family member can still help you out in this area. You can’t apply with a co-signer or co-borrower or use collateral for a Discover loan, however, meaning you’ll need to qualify on your own credit merits. It’s always a good idea to pay on time to avoid damaging your credit, but in this case, it’s especially important given that Discover charges an especially high late payment fee of $39.3 \nDiscover was founded in 1986 as a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company offering credit card services. It is headquartered in Riverwood, Illinois and has funded $10 billion in personal loans. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nNo origination fee\nExcellent customer satisfaction ratings\nCan send payment to creditors directly\nCons\nOnly accepts individual applications\nCan’t use collateral for a secured loan\nCan’t consolidate debt from a Discover credit card\nRequirements \nMust be at least 18 years old\n$25,000 minimum annual household income\nMust be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident\nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C\nMust have an email address, physical address, and a smartphone or computer4\nLoans can’t be used to consolidate debt from a mortgage, auto loan, or Discover credit card.\nBest for Emergency/Quick Funding : Upgrade \nAPR Range: 9.99% - 35.99% \nLoan Amount: $1,000 - $50,000 \nLoan Terms: 24 months - 84 months \nWhy We Chose It \nUpgrade accepts applicants with fair credit scores, and if you still don’t qualify or want lower rates, you can apply with three backup options: pledging a car for collateral, applying with a co-borrower, or applying with a co-signer. If you’re approved, you can receive your loan funds as soon as the next business day. \nYou do pay a price for that convenience, however: Each personal loan comes with an origination fee ranging from 1.85% to 9.99%, an expensive fee considering many lenders don’t charge anything at all. On the other hand, Upgrade does offer rate discounts if you sign up for autopay or a debt consolidation loan, and it offers a $200 sign-up bonus if you open and use a new Upgrade checking account when you take out your loan.5 \nUpgrade is headquartered in San Francisco, California. It has provided more than $31 billion in loans and credit since 2016. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nMultiple discount options\n$200 checking account bonus offer\nAllows collateral, co-borrowers, and co-signers\nCons\nExpensive origination fee\nPoor customer satisfaction ratings\nHigh interest rate for some applicants\nRequirements \nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nMust be at least 18 years old in most U.S. states\nMust have an email address and a bank account\nMust be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or non-permanent alien with a valid visa\nLoans can’t be used for college expenses, illegal activities, investments, or gambling.\nBest for Bad Credit : Upstart \nAPR Range: 7.80% - 35.99% \nLoan Amount: $1,000 - $50,000 \nLoan Terms: 36 months - 60 months \nWhy We Chose It \nFor borrowers with credit scores in the \"bad\" or \"poor\" range—between 300 and 579—finding a loan is not easy. Loans those borrowers do find usually come with APRs in the high double- or triple-digits. \nUpstart has the lowest minimum credit score of any lender on our list; they will consider applicants who don't even have sufficient credit history to produce a score. For those who do have a score, different Upstart partners have different minimums, offering credit access to the full spectrum of credit profiles. You can borrow up to $50,000, and, if approved, your loan funds can be disbursed in as little as one day. Rates won't go higher than 35.99%.6 \nEven if you have no credit history at all, you can still be eligible for a loan if you are enrolled in or graduated from a degree program. \nUpstart has made available to borrowers more than $35 billion in loans of various types, including personal loans. It is headquartered in San Mateo, California and was founded in 2012. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nLow minimum credit score\nFast funding\nGood loan amount flexibility\nCons\nHigh origination fee\nHigh APRs\nFewer loan term options than others\nRequirements \nFull range of credit scores are considered, including those with no score\nYou must be 18 years old.\nAn email, verifiable name, verifiable date of birth, and social security number\nU.S. bank account with routing number\nMinimum annual income of $12,000\nHave a job or one starting within six months7\nMeet partner lenders' credit requirements8\nBest for Excellent Credit : PenFed Credit Union \nAPR Range: 8.99% - 17.99% \nLoan Amount: $600 - $50,000 \nLoan Terms: 12 months - 60 months \nWhy We Chose It \nPentagon Federal Credit Union—or PenFed for short—is one of the largest credit unions in the country, with nearly three million members.9 It’s also one of the easiest to join, with no special requirements to meet other than popping $5 into a savings account to get your membership started. You can apply for a loan without joining to see your options, but if you decide to accept PenFed’s loan offer, you’ll need to join the credit union to receive your loan funds. \nYou’ll also need good credit in order to be approved. If you don’t have that on your own, you may be able to apply with a co-borrower or use collateral to secure your loan, although PenFed doesn’t provide any details on how this works. In addition to offering excellent rates on a wide range of loan amounts, PenFed also has a robust discount program offering savings on H&R Block tax preparation, college planning services, insurance, and more. \nPenFed is one of the nation’s largest credit unions. It was founded in 1935 and is headquartered in McLean, Virginia. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nNo origination fee\nExcellent range of loan options\nEasy membership requirements\nCons\nDoesn’t allow co-signers, but they do allow co-borrowers\nDoesn't offer longer loan terms\nDoesn’t offer direct payment to creditors\nRequirements \nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nMust join the credit union by depositing $5 in a savings account\nBest With No Credit Check : OppLoans \nAPR Range: 160.00% - 179.00% \nLoan Amount: $500 - $4,000 \nLoan Terms: 9 months - 18 months \nWhy We Chose It \nBorrowers with poor, or no, credit who cannot qualify for a personal loan from most other lenders may be able to qualify for a loan from OppLoans. Unlike most lenders, OppLoans doesn’t rely on a borrower’s credit score or credit history to make a lending decision. Borrowers also won’t pay origination fees and can access loan funds the same day. OppLoans provides a wealth of personal finance resources and tools on its website, and it has gotten strong reviews on third-party customer review sites like Trustpilot.10 \nBut it’s important to note that this accessibility comes at a high cost. Interest rates on OppLoans’s loans are considerably higher than traditional personal loans—you’ll pay an APR of 160% for your loan. Additionally, repayment plans are significantly shorter, just nine to 18 months, and you can only borrow up to $4,000.11 \nOppLoans was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It has extended loans to more than a million borrowers since its founding. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nNo minimum credit score requirement\nStrong customer service\nSame-day funding available\nCons\nVery high interest rates\nShort repayment terms\nNot available in all U.S. states\nRequirements \nBe at least 18 years of age\nHave a bank account\nHave a verifiable source of income\nReceive income through direct deposit\nAvailable in 38 states; not available in: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia.12\nBest Big Bank : U.S. Bank \nAPR Range: 8.74% - 24.99% \nLoan Amount: $1,000 - $50,000 \nLoan Terms: 12 months - 84 months \nWhy We Chose It \nWorking with a large bank offers the added advantage of being able to walk into a branch and talk to someone about your loan. U.S. Bank is the fifth-largest bank in the country, with over 2,300 branches in about half of U.S. states.13 Current customers of U.S. Bank will benefit the most, with reduced credit requirements and increased maximum loan amounts. \nIf you’re not a current customer, however, you’ll be limited to a smaller loan of $25,000 or less.14 U.S. Bank was ranked as the fourth-best personal loan option in 2024 by JD Power.1 \nU.S. Bank was founded in 1863 and is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nNo origination fee\nIn-branch service available\nAutopay discount\nCons\nOnly available in about half of U.S. states\nRestrictions for non-current customers\nRequirements \nOnly available in 27 U.S. states15\nBest for Small Loan Amounts : Lake Michigan Credit Union \nAPR Range: 9.99% - 18.00% \nLoan Amount: $250 - $25,000 \nLoan Terms: 24 months - 60 months \nWhy We Chose It \nLake Michigan Credit Union (LMCU) earns the nod for best small loan lender because it offers personal loans as small as $250—the smallest in our database with reasonable rates and terms. Many competitors have loan amounts starting between $500 and $2,000, and a few offer loans under $500, so you have some options, depending on the size of your need. \nLMCU also offers competitive APRs and doesn’t charge origination fees, helping to keep your borrowing costs down. Its minimum required credit score of 620 makes its loans accessible to borrowers with fair credit. \nBe aware that its max loan limit is low (if a larger loan is in your future), and its terms are not as flexible as other lenders we evaluated. It also doesn’t offer pre-qualification, which means you can’t see your rate and term without completing a formal application (with a slight downward nudge to your credit score). And because it’s a credit union, you’ll need to become a member before borrowing, although membership is easy to get.\nToday, LMCU has over $14 billion in assets, and it's the largest financial institution headquartered in West Michigan.16 It is the 17th largest credit union in the nation, based on asset size.17 \nPros & Cons \nPros\nSmall loan amounts\nLow minimum credit score of 620 required\nCons\nNo pre-qualification\nMembership required\nRequirements \nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nYou must have a minimum credit score of 620 to qualify for a personal loan with LMCU. \nTo become a member, you must live, work, or go to church in Florida or Michigan’s lower peninsula, be a U.S. citizen with an immediate family member who is an LMCU member, or be a U.S. citizen and contribute $5 to the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Fund.\nBest for Military Members : Navy Federal Credit Union \nAPR Range: 8.99% - 18.00% \nLoan Amount: $250 - $50,000 \nLoan Terms: 6 months - 180 months \nWhy We Chose It \nNavy Federal has a lot going for it. Aside from its wide range of term lengths and loan amounts to choose from, there are no origination fees and even a 0.25% rate discount on top of the already fantastic rates if you use autopay.18 It also received the second highest satisfaction score for personal loans in J.D. Power’s 2024 study (unofficially, as it does not meet all of J.D Power's requirements for inclusion), far surpassing any other lender.1 \nHowever, as the name implies, the biggest barrier for most people in accessing these loans is its military-only (or military-adjacent) membership requirement. Furthermore, assuming you’re even eligible to join, it’s a clunky process to apply if you’re not already a member. The credit union doesn’t offer a way to pre-qualify for its personal loans, meaning you’ll need to first join the credit union in order to see your options at all, even if you don’t end up selecting Navy Federal as your lender. \nNavy Federal Credit Union is the nation’s largest credit union. It was founded in 1933 and is headquartered in Vienna, Virginia. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nSame-day funding\nAutopay discount\nSecond highest J.D. Power customer satisfaction ratings\nCons\nDoesn’t allow co-signers\nNot available to most civilians\nDoesn’t offer loan pre-qualification\nRequirements \nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nMust join the credit union by depositing $5 in a savings account to establish membership\nMembership open to active-duty military members, veterans, Department of Defense contractors, and their families19\nBest Credit Union : Patelco Credit Union \nAPR Range: 9.30% - 17.90% \nLoan Amount: $300 - $100,000 \nLoan Terms: 6 months - 84 months \nWhy We Chose It \nPatelco’s personal loan program is a bit more intricate than most lenders, but that works to your advantage. You’ll be able to choose from a broad range of loan amounts and term lengths to suit just about any need you might have. Patelco also offers two discounts. The first is a 0.10% rate reduction if you meet Commitment Household Membership by using more of the credit union’s services. The second discount is 0.50% off your interest rate for paying on time for 12 months straight. This discount is given up to three times for a total of 1.50% off your interest rate for the rest of the loan's life.20 It'll pay the first year of your membership requirement, unlike most credit unions. \nPatelco is a relatively recent addition to our list of serious competitors for the best personal loans. So it may not be surprising that there’s not many reviews out there from actual customers. In addition, its checking accounts may come with monthly fees and its savings accounts don’t always offer good rates unless you have a high balance, making this a better option for people looking more for low loan rates than for high deposit account rates. \nPatelco Credit Union was founded in 1936 by employees of the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph company. Its headquarters are in Dublin, California and it boasts more than $9 billion in assets. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nNo origination fees\nMany discounts available\nWide range of loan options\nCons\nScarcity of customer reviews\nUninspiring checking and savings accounts\nRequirements \nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nMust become a credit union member\nIf you don't qualify to become a member for free, you can join the Financial Fitness Association; Patelco will pay for the first year.21\nBest For \nAPR Range\nAverage Origination Fee\nLate Fee\nTime to Receive Loan\nLoan Amount\nLatest Repayment\nReset All\nSoFi\tBest Overall\t8.99% - 29.49%\t0.00%-7.00%\t$0.00\t0 days\t$5,000 - $100,000\t84 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nDiscover\tBest for Debt Consolidation\t7.99% - 24.99%\t0.00%\t$39.00\t1 day\t$2,500 - $40,000\t84 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nUpgrade\tBest for Emergency/Quick Funding\t9.99% - 35.99%\t1.85%–9.99%\t$10.00\t1 day\t$1,000 - $50,000\t84 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nUpstart\tBest for Bad Credit\t7.80% - 35.99%\t0.00%–12.00%\t5% of the late payment amount or $15, whichever is greater\t1 days \t$1,000 - $50,000\t60 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nPenFed Credit Union\tBest for Excellent Credit\t8.99% - 17.99%\t0.00%\t$29.00\t1 day\t$600 - $50,000\t60 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nOppLoans\tBest With No Credit Check\t160.00% - 179.00%\t0.00%\t$0\t0 days\t$500 - $4,000\t18 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nU.S. Bank\tBest Big Bank\t8.74% - 24.99%\t0.00%\t$25.00\t0 days\t$1,000 - $50,000\t84 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nLake Michigan Credit Union\tBest for Small Loan Amounts\t9.99% - 18.00%\t0.00%\t4% of the balance that is due\t0 days\t$250 - $25,000\t60 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nNavy Federal Credit Union\tBest for Military Members\t8.99% - 18.00%\t0.00%\t$29.00\t0 days\t$250 - $50,000\t180 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\nPatelco Credit Union\tBest Credit Union\t9.30% - 17.90%\t0.00%\t3% of loan payment or $5, whichever is higher\t0 days\t$300 - $100,000\t84 months\tCheck Rates \t\nHide, not for me\n\t\n*APR ranges for some companies include a discount for automatic payments or existing bank customers. \nThe Bottom Line \nIf you're looking for a lender with great customer service and competitive rates, SoFi is a good pick. It offers the best all-around blend of attractive features, like reasonable rates and quick funding. Meanwhile, Navy Federal Credit Union is our go-to recommendation for military members due to its especially customer-friendly policies and outstanding reputation. Discover, PenFed Credit Union, and Lake Michigan Credit Union round out our top picks for borrower-friendly loans. \nWhat Is a Personal Loan and How Does It Work? \nAn unsecured personal loan is a general-purpose installment loan. Unlike auto loans or mortgages, a personal loan can be used for just about anything. A personal loan is paid out in one lump sum after your application is approved, typically via a bank deposit or a check mailed to you. Once your personal loan funds are disbursed, you’ll make the same fixed monthly payment for the life of the loan, usually a few years in length. \nUse our personal loan calculator to zero in on a loan amount and term that fits your credit, your financial history, and your budget. You can see how long it'll take you to pay down your loan—and your loan's total cost—with different amounts, rates, and credit levels.\nMost personal loans are unsecured, which means they’re not backed by collateral. If you have assets such as a car or cash savings, some lenders allow you to pledge them toward a secured personal loan to get lower rates or a better chance at approval. If you default, your lender can claim ownership of your collateral to repay your debt. \nPersonal loans may be solo, or you can have a co-signer or a co-borrower on your loan. A co-borrower is often someone such as a spouse or partner who agrees to share responsibility with you for paying off the loan from the start. Conversely, a co-signer only agrees to repay the loan if you default, giving the lender more peace of mind—which can sway them into approving your application. \nWhere to Get a Personal Loan\nYou'll find personal loans in most places where you already do your banking. Different types of lenders may offer personal loans with contrasting features or benefits. Those with excellent credit scores might have more opportunities. \nBanks: Personal loans aren’t the main attraction at most banks, although most do offer them. Banks tend to charge a higher interest rate on a personal loan and usually have stricter credit score requirements. \nCredit unions: You’ll need to meet membership requirements to join, but once in, credit unions are generally more flexible than banks in offering affordable personal loans to members.\nOnline lenders: You can find many more online lenders than local credit unions and banks, expanding your options significantly. Online lenders generally have the easiest-to-meet personal loan requirements of all.\nIf you're in a bind, or facing an emergency expense, you may be considering a payday loan, which is like an advance on your next paycheck. These short-term loans come with high interest rates and fees, resulting in APRs of 400% and more.22 Because of their expense, it can be hard to break the cycle of debt, with some borrowers taking loans week after week. For these reasons, you should avoid these types of loans whenever possible.\nNote that some banks offer lower rates than many credit unions do, for example, and some online lenders may be pickier about your credit score than other lenders. \nWho Has the Lowest Personal Loan Interest Rates? \nAmong the the 70 lenders we evaluated to create this list, American Express offers the lowest advertised rate, currently 6.90%. But not everyone is eligible for that rate. For one thing, American Express only lends to existing customers that it invites to apply. For another, the lowest advertised rates are only offered to borrowers with the strongest credit profiles (high credit scores, low debt-to-income ratios), and generally for loans with shorter terms. \nThis means lenders will offer most borrowers a rate other than the lowest advertised one. And for some borrowers, that might be a rate closer to the advertised maximum. \nThe average rate in the chart below is the average rate offered by 19 of our lender partners to borrowers who submit applications through their systems. It includes loan offers made to people with the strongest credit profiles and to those with the weakest. \nThe rate you might be offered may be better or worse than the average (hopefully it's better), but ultimately that will depend on the strength of your credit profile.\nPros and Cons of Personal Loans\nAs with any financial tool, it’s important to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks when borrowing money. \nPros\nQuick funding times\nPredictable monthly payments\nCheaper than using credit cards\nUse for a wide range of expenses\nBuilds credit with on-time payments\nCons\nUnsecured loans are more expensive than secured loans\nHarms credit if you miss payments or default\nMay lose collateral if you default on secured loan\nRequires good to excellent credit for the best rates\nReasons to Apply For a Personal Loan \nOne of the reasons why personal loans are so popular is because they can be used for just about anything. People commonly use personal loans to pay for: \nSurprise emergency expenses\nVeterinary or medical bills\nConsolidating higher-interest debt\nTaking a vacation or getting married\nHome improvement projects and repairs\nMost lenders don’t allow personal loans to be used for college tuition, business expenses, gambling, house down payments, or illegal activities. \nDebt consolidation is the most popular reason for getting a personal loan, according to Investopedia's 2023 Personal Loan Borrower Survey. Home improvements and large purchases were the next two most common reasons cited for seeking a loan. The best debt consolidation loans are personal loans with low interest rates and flexible repayment terms. \nAs with any financial tool, it’s important to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks if you’re looking to borrow money. \nHow to Choose the Best Personal Loan for You \nWhen you're shopping for a loan, here are some of the factors you should evaluate: \nInterest rates: This is the biggest expense associated with a loan, so it should be at the top of your comparison list. Look for a lender’s annual percentage rate (APR), which includes fees (like origination fees) and your personal loan's interest, so you’re comparing apples to apples.\nOrigination fees: Some lenders charge an origination fee to open the loan. Usually, this cost is subtracted from the total amount borrowed, so be sure you account for that in your planning.\nLoan amounts and term lengths: Some lenders may not offer loans in the amounts and repayment times you want or need.\nPrepayment penalties: These are fees the lender charges if you pay off the debt before the end of the term. These are rare with personal loans (none of the 70 lenders in our database charge them), but it’s worth looking out for.\nMinimum credit score and income requirements: Not all lenders share their qualification requirements upfront, but many do. If your credit is lower or your income is, you may have difficulty securing a loan you can afford.\nOption to use a co-signer or co-borrower: Many lenders allow you to apply with a co-signer or co-borrower, which can help you qualify.\nOption to use collateral: Personal loans are generally unsecured, so they don’t require collateral. Some lenders do offer secured personal loans (with cars, CDs, savings accounts, or even your home’s fixtures as collateral). This can make it easier to qualify and often results in lower APRs.\nDirect payment to old creditors: For debt consolidation loans, many lenders will pay your creditors directly. This is convenient for you and offers a bit of risk reduction for the bank.\nLoan use restrictions: Make sure the lender you are interested in borrowing from doesn’t have restrictions against how you intend to use the funds. Nearly all lenders prohibit using personal loans for gambling or investing, school expenses like tuition, or business funding. Some may have tighter restrictions. \nCustomer reviews and ratings: Finally, read a few reviews of potential lenders on financial product and service educational sites, as well as customer experience sites like Trustpilot to get as broad a view as possible.\nTip\nIt is important to consider all the costs potentially involved with a personal loan. Fortunately, most personal loan providers we surveyed don’t charge origination fees, which can add to the overall costs of the loan. However, it’s also important to be aware that the longer repayment terms offered by some lenders involve paying more interest over the life of the loan, despite reducing your monthly payments. - Sana Siddiqui, Investopedia Research Analyst\nHow to Qualify For a Personal Loan \nPersonal loans are usually easy to qualify for, but getting a loan with bad credit can be hard. Each lender has specific requirements you’ll need to meet, but in general, your chances of qualifying with any given lender increase if you have good to excellent credit, a consistently high income, and low existing debt payments. A healthy debt-to-income ratio will improve your approval odds and help you get a better rate. It may also be easier to qualify for smaller loan amounts with shorter term lengths. \nAverage APR by Credit Score\nBefore You Apply for a Personal Loan \nBefore you apply for a personal loan, take a hard look at your finances. \nReview your credit: Higher credit scores get the best rates and most options to choose from. Knowing your credit score from the start will help you understand your options, and why you receive the offers you do.\nReview your budget: Can you make changes to your budget that save you money and perhaps allow you to skip the loan altogether? Regardless, you'll need to know how much room you have in your budget to cover a monthly loan payment.\nConsider alternatives: Below you'll find a long list of alternatives to a personal loan, from credit card balance transfers to borrowing from friends. Is a personal loan your best option?\nGather financial details: Some of this will have come up during your budget review, but collect the key details of your financial life: monthly income, monthly expenses (particularly debt expense). Also calculate your debt to income ratio (DTI), which is your gross, before tax income divided by your monthly debt payments (like home loans, car loans, and credit card payments). Lenders will use your DTI as they consider your loan application. Lower DTIs are better than higher ones. If your DTI is already high and debt payments already crimping your budget, think carefully before adding more debt (and more monthly debt payments).\nGather important documents: You'll need a government-issued ID and Social Security number, and very likely recent paystubs and bank statements to prove your income. Gather them before you start for a smoother application process.\nHow to Apply for a Personal Loan, Step-by-Step \nMost lenders allow you to apply for a personal loan online, although you may be able to apply in person or over the phone, especially if you're dealing with a bank or credit union. \nGet pre-qualified: The personal loan application process usually starts by getting pre-qualified. You’ll provide a few basic details about yourself, such as your name, contact information, income, and Social Security number, to your potential lender. Most lenders offer pre-qualification, but not all. Pre-qualification doesn't usually involve a hard credit check, so you won't have to worry about too many credit inquiries hurting your credit score.\nReview options: The lender will do a soft credit check, which won’t affect your credit score. If the lender deems you likely to be approved, they’ll respond with a personal loan offer outlining your options, interest rates, and loan costs. You can use this to compare rates and terms and other features among several lenders.\nComplete an application: Once you find the best personal loan option, you’ll complete a full loan application with that lender. You’ll typically need to provide copies of documents proving your identity (government-issued identity photo I.D.), income (recent pay stubs, tax returns, or W-2s), and finances (recent bank statements). At this stage the lender will perform a hard credit check. \nReceive funds: If you’re approved, your lender will disburse your loan funds to your bank account or by check, depending on its policies. \nAlternatives to Personal Loans \nPersonal loans are not your only option if you need a flexible way to borrow money. Depending on your circumstances, here are a few other good options to consider: \n0% APR credit card: If you can qualify for a 0% APR credit card, you may be able to make a big purchase or transfer existing credit card debt with a long runway to pay it off. \nPersonal line of credit: Some banks and credit unions offer personal lines of credit that you can draw against as needed, a particularly good option if you need frequent small loans.\nHome equity loan or HELOCs: Homeowners with at least 20% equity in their home may be able to use a home equity loan or line of credit to borrow money, a particularly good option for home improvements and repairs.23 \n401(k) loan: Not an option to consider lightly, but in some circumstances, taking a loan from your 401(k) retirement account can be a cost-effective way to borrow. \nLoans from family or friends: Ask around your social support network if someone would be willing to lend you money in exchange for writing a promissory note or loan agreement with interest. \nCrowdfunding: If you need to borrow money for a compelling and share-worthy reason, you may be able to raise the funds on a crowdfunding platform with no debt needed. \nGrants or charity: Many government and nonprofit programs offer assistance for things you’d use a personal loan for, like catching up on home repairs.24 If you need help finding options, 211.org offers free personal assistance. \nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat Is the Best Bank for a Personal Loan?\nU.S. Bank offers the best personal loans among big banks, according to our research. It features affordable rates with no origination fees and is available to roughly half of U.S. states. If you’re willing to work with an online lender, SoFi is our best all-around choice, featuring similar rates to U.S. Bank but offering an additional benefits package with free access to financial advisors and career counseling, among other benefits.\nWhat Personal Loan Is the Easiest to Get Approved For?\nIf you don’t have good credit or a high income on your own, it may be easier to get approved if you have a creditworthy co-signer or co-borrower. Some lenders also allow you to use collateral to better qualify for a loan or receive lower rates. Finally, a personal loan from an institution you already have a relationship with, like a bank or credit union you have a checking or savings account with, may provide a more streamlined approval process.\nWhat Credit Score Is Needed for a Personal Loan?\nThe average personal loan borrower had a credit score of 685 during the final quarter of 2022.25 This can vary quite a bit, though; some lenders, such as Upstart, have no minimum credit score requirement. Others, require a credit score over 700. Banks and credit unions tend to have higher credit score requirements, while fintech lenders generally accept lower credit scores.\nHow Much Money Can You Borrow With a Personal Loan?\nSome lenders, such as SoFi, offer personal loans up to $100,000.2 However, that doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily qualify for that much. Each lender assesses your financial situation—including your monthly income and debt payments—when deciding the maximum loan amount you can borrow after you submit a loan application.\nAre Personal Loans Taxable?\nA personal loan from a bank or other lender is not considered income by the IRS, and is not taxable. However, if you were run into financial trouble and worked out an agreement with your lender to forgive the loan, the amount forgiven would be considered income, and would be taxable.26 In some cases the lender might send you a form (1099-C, Cancellation of Debt), which will note the amount you must report on your tax return.27 Regardless if your lender sends you the form, you must report the forgiven debt as income on your return.\nHow Much Would a $5,000 Personal Loan Cost a Month?\nThe monthly cost of a personal loan, of whatever amount, will depend on the loan amount, the loan term (or the number of monthly payments), and the interest rate. The easiest way to calculate a monthly payment is to use a personal loan calculator. A $5,000 loan, paid over 24 months (or two years), with an interest rate of 12.33% (the current average rate charged on two-year personal loans, according to the Federal Reserve) would result in a monthly payment of $236.14.28\nWhat Is the Best Personal Loan Out There?\nAccording to Investopedia's research, SoFi offers the best personal loans when you consider rates, fees, amounts and term, and additional factors like customer experience. Some lenders offer loans for lower interest rates or accept borrowers with weaker credit profiles or offer longer terms. But overall, we rate SoFi the highest.\nWhat Company Is Best for a Personal Loan?\nAccording to our research, SoFi is the best overall personal loan lender based on it's combination of competitive rates, large loan amounts, and wide range of repayment terms. Where it really shines is with customer service and experience, offering a bevy helpful services to its customers, from a well-regarded mobile app to financial hardship assistance.\nCompanies We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed 70 lenders to find the 10 lenders you see above on this list.

We researched and evaluated APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and much more. To rank the lenders in our database and to generate star ratings, we weighted the data we collected, based in part on what consumers told us were the most important features of a personal loan and lender in a survey we conducted. We grouped those factors into four broad areas: \nLoan costs (advertised APR, fees, and six other factors): 29.25%\nLoan terms (loan amount, repayment term, and three other factors): 22.25%\nBorrowing requirements (credit score, membership requirement, and six other factors): 28.5%\nAdditional features (online application, pre-qualification, and eight other factors): 20%\nLearn more about how we evaluated personal loans in our complete methodology. \nLearn More About Personal Loans\nWhat is a personal loan?\nHow do personal loans work?\nWhen are personal loans a good idea?\nHow to get a personal loan\nHow to apply for a personal loan\nHow to use a personal loan\nWhere to get a personal loan\nPersonal loans vs credit cards\nAlternatives to personal loans\nPersonal loan calculator\nPersonal loans methodology \nInvestopedia / Alice Morgan\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

  "text": "Compare Current Mortgage Rates Today\nAs of Nov. 1, 2024, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.88%, 20-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.84%, 15-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.99%, and 10-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.99%. Average rates for other loan types include 5.39% for an FHA 30-year fixed mortgage and 6.81% for a jumbo 30-year fixed mortgage. \nThese fixed-rate loan averages are not the teaser rates you may see advertised online. To find the average mortgage rates today, we use data from approximately 40 lenders, assuming a down payment of at least 20% and an applicant credit score in the 680–739 range. We believe this is more representative of what customers could expect to be quoted, depending on their qualifications. \nToday's Mortgage Rates \nEditor's Note\nOur daily mortgage rate averages are based on data from Zillow Group Marketplace. As this involves a different rate source and methodology, the averages will not directly align with those we published prior to May 1, 2024. All the historical data and analysis in this article and future articles is also based on this new data source.\nOur Expert Picks for the Best Mortgage Lenders \nHow to Use Our Mortgage Rate Tables \nOur mortgage rate table is designed to help you compare mortgage rates for the type of home loan you’re being offered by lenders to know if they are better or worse than the best rates available. These rates are benchmark rates for those with good credit, not the teaser rates that make everyone think they will get the lowest rate available. Of course, your personal credit profile will be a significant factor in what rate you get quoted, but you will be able to begin comparison shopping for either new purchase or refinance rates with confidence before you choose a mortgage lender. \n30-Year Mortgage Rates \nWhat Is a 30-Year Mortgage? \nA 30-year mortgage is a conventional home loan that offers a fixed rate for a 30-year term. This means that your monthly payments, consisting of the principal and interest, remain the same throughout the lifetime of the loan. Some 30-year mortgages are government-backed loans, such as the ones from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). \nMost borrowers choose a 30-year mortgage because it has lower monthly loan balance payments compared to other terms, freeing up room for other financial goals. According to Freddie Mac, this is the most popular type of mortgage, with almost 90% of homeowners opting for a 30-year term.1\nWho Should Consider a 30-Year Mortgage? \nPeople looking to buy a home who want the lowest possible mortgage payments given record-high home prices should consider a 30-year mortgage. Although it may come with a higher interest rate compared to other home loan terms, monthly mortgage payments are lower because they are extended over a long term.\nIn the News\nEvery Thursday, Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored buyer of mortgage loans, publishes a weekly average of 30-year mortgage rates. The latest reading is 6.08%—the lowest weekly average since September 2022. Freddie Mac's average last October reached a historic 23-year peak of 7.79%.2\nFreddie Mac’s average differs from what we report for 30-year rates because Freddie Mac calculates a weekly average that blends five previous days of rates. In contrast, our Investopedia 30-year average is a daily reading, offering a more precise and timely indicator of rate movement. In addition, the criteria for included loans (e.g., amount of down payment, credit score, inclusion of discount points) varies between Freddie Mac's average and our own.\n20-Year Mortgage Rates \nWhat is a 20-Year Mortgage? \nLike a conventional 30-year mortgage a 20-year mortgage is a home loan with a fixed rate but with a shorter 20-year term. Monthly payments, consisting of the principal and interest, remain the same throughout the term of the loan. \nThe main benefit of a 20-year mortgage is the savings homeowners receive from lower interest rates and paying it off sooner than 30 years. \nWho Should Consider a 20-Year Mortgage? \nAny homeowner who borrows money to benefit from lower interest rates and pay off their mortgage sooner than later should consider a 20-year mortgage. In general, 20-year mortgage rates are lower than 30-year ones, helping to reduce the payments of interest over the course of the loan. \nHowever, a 20-year mortgage pays the loan off faster and thus has a higher monthly obligation. Homeowners should factor in higher costs to their monthly budget when it comes to choosing a 20-year mortgage, although it is still less than what a 15-year mortgage would require. \n15-Year Mortgage Rates \nWhat Is a 15-Year Mortgage? \nA 15-year mortgage is a fixed-rate loan to pay for a home purchase. The monthly payment, which includes principal and interest, remains the same throughout the lifetime of the mortgage. It is paid off in half the time of a traditional 30-year mortgage. The shorter repayment period and the higher monthly payments result in a savings of thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan although monthly payments are higher compared to longer-term mortgage loans.\nWho Should Consider a 15-year Mortgage? \nA 15-year mortgage is a smart option for borrowers who want to save money on interest and can afford larger monthly payments without compromising their other financial goals and responsibilities. \nFor instance, a borrower who can't take out a 15-year mortgage without sacrificing regular contributions to a savings account and a retirement fund should probably stick to a longer-term mortgage. A 20-year term can offer a happy medium. \nFor borrowers who have variable or sporadic incomes, a 15-year mortgage makes sense only if there is a realistic plan to make the mortgage payment through the lean periods.\n10-Year Mortgage Rates \nWhat is a 10-Year Mortgage \nA 10-year mortgage is the shortest fixed-rate loan available for a home purchase. As with longer-term mortgage loans, the monthly payment remains the same throughout the lifetime of the mortgage. It is paid off in one-third of the time of a traditional 30-year mortgage. The abbreviated period results in much lower interest being paid over the life of the loan but involves higher monthly payments vs. longer-term mortgage loans. \n\nThe major benefit of taking out a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage is that homeowners can pay off their loans much faster than other loan terms. Since rates may be lower than a 20- or 30-year term and because homeowners are making fewer payments, borrowers will save the most money on interest with a 10-year term. Plus, homeowners will be able to build equity much faster. \nWho Should Consider a 10-Year Mortgage? \nHomeowners who want to pay off their mortgage quickly and have the means to pay the large monthly payment should consider a 10-year mortgage. Also, since lenders may view these types of borrowers as more high-risk (since you’ll need to pay more each month), you’ll most likely need to have an excellent credit profile to qualify. \nA 10-year home loan is also best for those who want to refinance their mortgage and have been paying down their existing loan for a while. For instance, those who have close to 10 years until they’re mortgage-free may not want to refinance to a loan with a longer term. That is, unless you’re looking to refinance to a longer term to lower payments—keep in mind you’ll end up paying more in interest in the long run if you go with the longer loan term. \nCompare Mortgage Payments for 30-Year, 20-Year, 15-Year, and 10-Year Mortgages \nTrends in Mortgage Rates: Will They Continue Falling? \nTrends in mortgage rates are influenced by complex factors, such as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy, employment rate, the Consumer Price Index, and the yields of 10-year treasury bonds. Mortgage rates are not directly tied to any of these factors but are indirectly influenced by their current levels and consensus predictions on how they will trend in the near future. \nMortgage rates are determined by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, such as: \nThe level and direction of the bond market, especially 10-year Treasury yields\nThe Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, especially as it relates to bond buying and funding government-backed mortgages\nCompetition between mortgage lenders and across loan types\nBecause any number of these can cause fluctuations simultaneously, it's generally difficult to attribute the change to any one factor. \nMacroeconomic factors kept the mortgage market relatively low for much of 2021. In particular, the Federal Reserve had been buying billions of dollars of bonds in response to the pandemic's economic pressures. This bond-buying policy is a major influencer of mortgage rates. \nBut starting in November 2021, the Fed began tapering its bond purchases downward, making sizable reductions each month until reaching net zero in March 2022.3 \nBetween that time and July 2023, the Fed aggressively raised the federal funds rate to fight decades-high inflation. While the fed funds rate can influence mortgage rates, it doesn't directly do so. In fact, the fed funds rate and mortgage rates can move in opposite directions. \nBut given the historic speed and magnitude of the Fed's 2022 and 2023 rate increases—raising the benchmark rate 5.25 percentage points over 16 months—even the indirect influence of the fed funds rate has resulted in a dramatic upward impact on mortgage rates over the last two years. \nThe Fed maintained the federal funds rate at its peak level for almost 14 months, beginning in July 2023. But on Sept. 18, the central bank announced the first rate cut in what's expected to be a series of decreases in 2024 and likely 2025, which should exert downward pressure on mortgage rates. This first reduction was by 0.50 percentage points. \nThe Fed's next rate announcement will be made Nov. 7. \nWhat Is a Mortgage and How Does It Work? \nA mortgage is a type of loan used to purchase or maintain a home, land, or other types of real estate. The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular payments divided into principal and interest. The property then serves as collateral to secure the loan. \nIndividuals and businesses use mortgages to buy real estate without paying the entire purchase price upfront. The borrower repays the loan plus interest over a specified number of years until they own the property free and clear. Most traditional mortgages are fully amortizing. This means that the regular payment required will stay the same, but different proportions of principal vs. interest will be paid over the life of the loan with each payment. Typical mortgage terms are for 30 or 15 years.\nTypes of Mortgages \nThere are numerous types of mortgages in the mortgage market, including those from private mortgage lenders as well as government-backed loan programs that purchase, guarantee, and securitize mortgages in the secondary mortgage market like those by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), known as FHA loans, or the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). \nA conventional mortgage can be fixed-rate with terms varying from 10 to 30 years or an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) with terms up to 10 years. Jumbo mortgage loans that exceed the Federal Housing Finance Agency's conforming loan limit of $766,550 for 2024 cannot be purchased, guaranteed, or securitized by Fannie Mae or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).3 Jumbo loans offer the same fixed and variable rate terms as conventional mortgage loans, though their interest rates are typically lower.\nMortgage Options for First-Time Homebuyers \nWhile most mortgage originations occur in the private market, government-backed mortgages occupy an important niche and provide access to first-time homebuyers and borrowers who could not otherwise qualify or afford the terms of traditional mortgages. \nGovernment-backed loans like FHA loans, state FHA loans, USDA loans (USDA guaranteed loans), and VA loans (backed by the Department of Veteran Affairs) can offer significant advantages to qualifying borrowers, including lower interest, longer terms, and a lower percentage of down payment (or no down payment) compared to conventional loans. For these types of loans with lower down payment options, the borrower can be required to acquire private mortgage insurance (PMI).\nThe Difference Between Interest Rate and APR \nThe advertised rate or nominal interest rate for a loan, whether for a mortgage, personal loan, or credit card, is the basic cost of borrowing the principal stated as a percentage. The annual percentage rate (APR), reflected as a percentage, is the total cost of the loan, including the fees and all other costs associated with the loan, in this case, a mortgage loan, such as the origination fee and discount points. \nThe APR, therefore, almost always calculates to a higher interest rate than the nominal interest rate since fees and other costs are factored into the rate, including the interest rate. \nHow Are Mortgage Rates Set? \nMortgage rates are set based on a few factors, economic forces being one of them. For instance, lenders look at the prime rate—the lowest rate banks offer for loans—which typically follows trends set by the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate, currently set at a range of 5.25% - 5.50%. Fed Funds rates are typically stated in this type of range, which varies that rate by 0.25 percent. \nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield can also reveal market trends. If the bond yield increases, mortgage rates tend to go up, and vice versa. The 10-year Treasury yield is usually the best standard to judge mortgage rates. That’s because many mortgages are refinanced or paid off after 10 years, even if the norm is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan. \nFactors that the borrower can control are their credit score and the home equity that will be created by the down payment amount. Since a lender sets rates based on the risk they may take, borrowers who are less creditworthy or have a lower down payment amount may be quoted higher rates. In other words, the lower the risk, the lower the rate for the borrower.\nHow to Get the Best Mortgage Rates \nThere are several things to keep in mind when shopping for mortgage rates to ensure you get the best deal:\nKnow your credit score.\nEstimate how much down payment you can make using our mortgage calculator.\nEstimate how long you plan to stay in your home.\nDetermine the best type and term of mortgage, whether fixed-rate or variable-rate, that is most affordable based on the factors above.\nUse our rate table to help you identify whether lenders are offering you a competitive rate based on your credit profile.\nAvoid opening new types of credit accounts like credit cards or personal loans before applying for a mortgage, as these can temporarily lower your credit score.\nShopping around can save money\nAccording to research by Freddie Mac, mortgage borrowers who shopped around for the best rate saved significant sums of money on interest and fees compared to those who did not. Specifically, those who received two quotes saved an average of $600, and those who received four or more quotes saved an average of $1,200 on the mortgage cost.4Similar research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed that borrowers who shopped around saved an average of 18 basis points on their mortgage loan rate.5\nHow Do I Qualify for Better Mortgage Rates? \nQualifying for better mortgage rates can help you save money, potentially tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. Here are a few ways you can ensure you find the most competitive rate possible: \nRaise your credit score: A borrower's credit score is a major factor in determining mortgage rates. The higher the credit score, the more likely a borrower can get a lower rate. It's a good idea to check your credit score to see how you can improve it, whether that's by making on-time payments or disputing errors on your credit report. \nIncrease your down payment: Most lenders offer lower mortgage rates for those who make a larger down payment. This will depend on the type of mortgage you apply for, but sometimes, putting down at least 20% could get you more attractive rates. \nLower your debt-to-income ratio: Also called DTI, your debt-to-income ratio looks at the total of your monthly debt obligations and divides it by your gross income. Usually, lenders don't want a DTI of 43% or higher, as that may indicate that you may have challenges meeting your monthly obligations as a borrower, as adding a mortgage payment could potentially put you underwater. The lower your DTI, the less risky you will appear to the lender, which will be reflected in a lower interest rate. \nHow to Apply for a Mortgage \nA mortgage application is made through a lender such as a bank, credit union, or mortgage company and involves providing extensive information including: \nBorrower details\nBorrower’s address, marital status, and dependents\nThe type of credit being applied for, meaning whether it’s a joint or individual application\nSocial Security number and date of birth\nCurrent employer and address, as well as employment income\nFinancial data\nAssets include bank accounts, retirement accounts, certificates of deposit, savings accounts, and brokerage accounts for stocks or bonds\nLiabilities include revolving credit, such as credit cards or store charge cards, and installment loans, such as student, car, and personal loans\nAny other real estate owned and its estimated value or rental income, if applicable\nProperty and loan request details\nAddress of the property\nThe loan amount, and the type of loan, such as a purchase or refinance\nAny rental income from the property or if you are buying the home as an investment to generate rental income\nDeclarations\nWhether the home be your primary residence or your second home\nDetermine if there are any judgments, lawsuits, or liens against you or the home being purchased\nIf the borrower has had any past foreclosures or is currently the guarantor for another loan\nHow to Refinance Your Mortgage \nThe process for refinancing a mortgage is similar to getting a purchase mortgage in that it entails shopping for rates and loan terms based on your credit score and completing an application. Instead of obtaining an appraisal on the property being initially purchased a new appraisal is required on the home you are refinancing. Also, unlike a new purchase mortgage, refinancing does not require a down payment. Mortgage refinancing does involve closing costs, so it's important to project a breakeven point with these costs measured against your potential savings when rates drop enough to consider refinancing your mortgage to determine if it makes financial sense. \nBelow are the steps involved in refinancing a mortgage: \nCheck your credit\nReview your credit reports to verify financial information\nYou can obtain a free copy of your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus each year from AnnualCreditReport.com\nMany credit card issuers provide your current credit score on your monthly statement or upon request\nDecide the type of loan you want\nRefi mortgage loans come in the same types and terms as purchase mortgages\nLonger refinancing terms provide lower interest rates but can ultimately entail more interest costs\nIf you have built up equity in your current mortgage a cash-out refi can be an option\nIn a decreasing mortgage rate environment adjustable-rate mortgage refinance options can become more attractive\nCompare lender's rates and terms\nInterest rates can vary by lender based on your credit score and property location\nShopping around is a proven way to find the most favorable rates\nApply for the loan\nThe mortgage refinance application process is very similar to a purchase mortgage application\nOnline loan applications and approval is widely available\nSurvey and inspection may be required\nFinalize terms and lock in the rate\nOnce a competitive rate that fits your parameters is found you can lock the rate just as with a purchase mortgage\nPay off your old mortgage with your new loan\nOnce your mortgage refinance loan is approved and funded you can have the funds transferred to the mortgage lender who originated your purchase mortgage to pay off that loan\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) \nWhat Is a Mortgage Rate?\nA mortgage rate is the amount of interest determined by a lender to be charged on a mortgage. These rates can be fixed—meaning the rate is set based on a benchmark rate—for the duration of the borrower’s mortgage term, as in the case of a 15-year fixed rate mortgage, or variable based on the mortgage terms and current rates. The rate is one of the key factors for borrowers when seeking home financing options since it’ll affect their monthly payments and how much they’ll pay throughout the lifetime of the loan. \nHow Big of a Mortgage Can I Afford?\nIn general, homeowners can afford a mortgage that’s two to two-and-a-half times their annual gross income. For instance, if you earn $80,000 a year, you can afford a mortgage from $160,000 to $200,000. Keep in mind that this is a general guideline, and you need to look at additional factors when determining how much you can afford, such as your lifestyle and your attitudes and habits around personal finance. Your lender will determine what it thinks you can afford based on your income, debts, assets, and liabilities. Using a mortgage calculator can be helpful in this situation to help you figure out how you can comfortably afford a mortgage payment.\nWhat Are Mortgage Points?\nAlso known as discount points, this is a one-time fee, or prepaid interest borrowers purchase to lower the interest rate for their mortgage. Discount points equate to percentage points - so, one discount point costs 1% of your mortgage amount, or $1,000 for every $100,000, and will lower the rate by a quarter of a percent, or 0.25.\nAnother option for a reduced-rate mortgage is through a 2-1 buydown mortgage, which entails a low rate in the first year, a somewhat higher rate in the second year, and then the regular mortgage rate for the remaining term of the mortgage.\nWill Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2024?\nMortgage rates should begin to trend downward later in 2024 if the Federal Reserve lowers the Fed funds rate at any of its remaining meetings this year, as it signaled that it may do if inflation can be sustainably moderated, i.e. moving in the direction of the 2% target level. The Fed kept rates in place at its most recent meeting on June 12, however.\nHow Much Will I Need for a Down Payment?\nThe minimum you’ll need to put down will depend on the type of mortgage. Many lenders require a minimum of 5% to 20%, whereas others like government-backed ones require at least 3.5%. The VA loan is the exception with no down payment requirements. \nGenerally, the higher your down payment, the lower your rate may be. Homeowners who put down at least 20% will be able to save the most. \nWhat Banks Have the Best Mortgage Rates Right Now?\nBank of America has some of the lowest mortgage rates among big banks right now but many banks and credit unions have competitive rates in local markets around the country so borrowers should do their homework before committing to a mortgage. We rank Bank of America as the best big bank mortgage lender because they offer multiple loan options for low- and middle-income borrowers, have a massive branch network across all 50 states, and offer loans with down payments as low as 0% - 3%. When comparing rates on bank and mortgage lender websites it's important to note that many quote rates that involve the purchase of discount points. The rates that Investopedia tracks do not involve discount points.\nWhat Is a Good Mortgage Rate?\nA good mortgage rate, which is usually represented as the lowest available rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage, will depend on the borrower. Lenders will advertise the lowest rate offered but yours will depend on factors like your credit history, income, other debts, and your down payment. For instance, a good mortgage rate for someone who has a low credit score tends to be higher than for someone who has a higher credit score.\nIt’s important to understand what will affect your individual rate and work towards optimizing your finances so you can receive the most competitive rate based on your financial situation.\nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia collects the best rates on actual closed mortgages through a third-party data provider from more than 200 companies every business day to identify the most competitive rates and terms in the nation as well as in the states in which our readers reside. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best mortgage rates since 2021.\nHow We Track the Best Mortgage Rates \nTo assess mortgage rates, we first needed to create a credit profile. This profile included a credit score ranging from 700 to 760 with a property loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80%. With this profile, we averaged the lowest rates offered by more than 200 of the nation’s top lenders. These rates represent what real consumers will see when shopping for a mortgage. \nThe same credit profile was used for the best state rates map. We then found the lowest rate currently offered by a surveyed lender in that state. \nRemember that mortgage rates may change daily, and this average rate data is intended for informational purposes only. A person’s personal credit and income profile will be the deciding factors in what loan rates and terms they can get. Loan rates do not include amounts for taxes or insurance premiums, and individual lender terms will apply. \nYour Guide to Mortgage Rates \nWhat Is a Mortgage?\nMortgage Calculator\nHow to Apply for a Mortgage\nHow to Find the Best Mortgage Rates\nHow to Choose a Mortgage\nBest Jumbo Mortgage Rates\nBest Mortgage Refinance Companies\nInvestopedia / Arif Qazi",

  "text": "Insurance\nInsurance Basics\nFrequently Asked Questions\nInsurance companies generate revenue from premiums paid on outstanding policies and net profit on the difference between revenue and policy claim expenses.\nInsurance brokers typically earn commissions on the sale of policies, either on a flat rate per policy or on a percentage of the insured amount.\nInsurance policies often have deductibles, especially with health and auto insurance, in order to partially offset the cost of providing coverage by the company and can keep premiums lower if customers opt for higher deductible amounts.\nThere is definite gender bias in insurance coverage depending on type of insurance. With auto insurance there can be gender discrimination tied to income and credit scores, while with life insurance women generally pay lower rates due to longer life expectancy.\nYes, insurance carriers typically offer significant discounts for those who have multiple types of coverage with their company, such as bundling car and homeowners insurance.\nKey Terms\nInsurance Coverage\nInsurance coverage refers to the amount of protection within an insurance policy that covers a specific type of loss. Coverage is typically meant to completely replace the value of the insured item or items. In the case of life insurance the coverage amount is typically based on a fixed amount or calculated on a multiple of years of lost income should the insured person die.\nInsurance Premium\nAn insurance premium is the amount of money the customer pays to the insurance underwriter each month to maintain the policy. Insurance premiums cover the cost of providing coverage by the insurance company based on the risk or probability of loss.\nInsurance Underwriter\nAn insurance underwriter is the company that takes on the risk of covering a specific type of loss event in exchange for payment of premiums during the term of the policy. Insurance underwriters pool the risk of loss across large numbers of policyholders and set premiums based on the managed risk of coverage.\nInsurance Claim\nAn insurance claim is the notification of the underwriter by the policyholder that a covered loss has occurred. Insurance companies have specific processes for policyholders to file insurance claims in the event of loss along with service level expectations for claim processing that are detailed in the insurance policy contract.\nInsurance Adjuster\nAn insurance adjuster is an employee of the insurance underwriter who investigates covered loss claims and authorizes payouts. Once the policyholder files a claim and insurance adjuster will contact the policyholder to understand the time, date and nature of the covered claim and make an adjustment or payment based on eligibility, less any deductible.\nSelf Insurance\nSelf insurance is a process by which a person or company assumes the risk of loss themselves by saving the money that would have otherwise been paid in the form of premiums in order to build up a fund to cover potential losses. Individuals that choose to self insure bare all the risk for a loss event rather than pooling the risk with other people who might also experience the type of loss that might present financial loss.\nExplore Insurance\nWhat Is the NAIC Complaint Index for Insurance?\nSo Your Pet Needs ACL Surgery: Will Your Insurance Cover It?\nWhat It Costs to Protect Your Pup With Dog Insurance\nWhat Is Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) Insurance?\nThe Insurance Industry Confronts Its Own Racism\nBest Cancel for Any Reason Travel Insurance of 2024\nDo I Need Travel Insurance?\nHow Prescription Drug Negotiations Will Impact Medicare Beneficiaries\nWedding Insurance: Meaning, Riders, Coverage\nDiscrimination in Insurance Underwriting Guidelines\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated Feb 02, 2024 \nWhy Your Unemployment Check or Direct Deposit Is Late (and What to Do About It)\nGender and Insurance Costs\nTrupanion vs. Healthy Paws\nInsuring Your Parrot, Ferret, Potbellied Pig, or Horse\nBest Event Insurance Companies\nWhat Is Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)?\nFinal Expense Insurance: What It Is, Who Needs It, Pros and Cons\nReinsurance Explained: What It Is, How It Works, Types\nReinsurance Definition, Types, and How It Works\nUnderwriter in Finance: What Do They Do, What Are Different Types?\nUnderwriting: Definition and How the Various Types Work\nIndemnity: What It Means in Insurance and the Law\nInsurance Coverage: Major Types and How They Work\nInsurance Premium Defined, How It's Calculated, and Types\nInsurance Underwriter: Definition, What Underwriters Do\nWhat Is an Insurance Score?

  "text": "Fundamental Analysis\nBasics of Fundamental Analysis\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQuantitative fundamental analysis analyzes an investment according to easily measured factors, such as the earnings or assets of the company that issued a stock. Qualitative analysis looks at harder to measure factors such as the quality of a company’s management or the strength of its brand. There is not a hard line between the two and some factors can fall into both categories.\nFundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.\nFinancial statements contain many of the key metrics that help investors determine if a company is undervalued or overpriced. Financial statements have a company’s level of profitability, how much it holds in different types of assets, as well as how fast its sales and profits have grown over time. All of these figures are core parts of determining if a company is properly valued.\nThere is no one answer to this question as different companies will naturally have different PE ratios. For example, mature companies in defensive stock sectors generally have low PE ratios, while early stage companies or companies in fast-growing sectors often have very high PE ratios. To make the most of PE ratio as a metric of company value, make sure to compare PE ratios to similar companies in similar sectors, as well as to the same company at different periods in the past to get better comparisons.\nKey Terms\nStrength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) Analysis\nSWOT analysis is a qualitative analysis method for analyzing a company’s competitive position. It is meant to help figure out how a company can best take advantage of opportunities in its market\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form S-1\nAn S-1 is the SEC registration form filed by companies seeking to become publicly traded in the U.S. It contains important information for investors seeking to invest in newly public companies.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K\nA 10-K is an annual financial report the SEC requires all publicly traded companies in the U.S. to file. 10-K’s are a valuable source of informations for investors seeking to analyze a company.\nPrice-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\nPE ratio is the ratio of a company’s stock price to its earnings per share. Value investors commonly use it as one way to measure if a company is undervalued.\nFundamentals\nThe fundamentals of an investment refer to the underlying factors that contribute to the price of an investment. Examples of these include the cash flow of a government who issued a bond or the profitability of a company whose stock you own.\nPorter's 5 Forces\nPorter’s Five Forces is a fundamental analysis model for analyzing a company’s place within its industry or sector. The five forces are: competition in the industry, potential of new entrants into the industry, power of suppliers, power of customers, threat of substitute products.\nValue Investing\nValue investing seeks to invest in companies trading for less than what their underlying fundamental metrics indicate they are worth. This is usually done by using fundamental or quantitative analysis strategies.\nMacro Environment\nThe macro environment refers to the broader economic conditions affecting the performance of an investment or a company. This can include factors such as inflation, unemployment, and place in the business cycle.\nExplore Fundamental Analysis\nRequired Rate of Return (RRR): Definition and Examples\nBook Value Per Common Share (BVPS): Definition and Calculation\nPrice-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Examples\nTerminal Value (TV) Definition and Formula\n10-K: Definition, What's Included, Instructions, and Where to Find It\nAmortization vs. Depreciation: What's the Difference?\nBottom-Line Growth vs. Top-Line Growth: What's the Difference?\nCash Cow: Definition, Investment Type, and Examples\nPorter's Five Forces Explained and How to Use the Model\nHow to Perform a SWOT Analysis\nWhat Causes Dividends per Share to Decrease?\nPrice to Free Cash Flow: Definition, Uses, and Calculation\nWhat Are Fundamentals?

  "text": "Mortgage Types and How Each One Works\nWe designed and built a robust data collection and analysis process to evaluate lenders and help borrowers find and choose the best purchase mortgage loan for them. \nFirst, we surveyed recent homebuyers about their experience and learned what features and services were most important to them. This information fueled the creation of a list of 55 criteria to include in a quantitative model to rank 38 direct-to-borrower lenders. \nWe then collected over 2,000 data points for the model, surveying mortgage lenders and collecting data via media contacts, lender websites, customer service calls, and industry and government databases. After collection and verification, we weighted 36 of the 55 individual criteria, giving higher weight to those criteria that mean the most to borrowers. Those scores resulted in the following list of the best mortgage lenders. \nWinners\nBest Overall, Best for Customer Experience, Best for First-Time Homebuyers: Rocket Mortgage\nAlso Good for Customer Experience: Chase\nAlso Good for First-Time Homebuyers: Ally Bank\nBest for Fast Closing, Best for Range of Loan Types: Rate\nAlso Good for a Range of Loan Types: U.S. Bank\nBest Big-Bank Mortgage Lender: Bank of America\nBest for Bad Credit: American Pacific Mortgage\nBest for Veterans: Veterans United Home Loans\nBest Credit Union Mortgage Lender: PenFed Credit Union\nMortgage\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMany mortgage servicers accept online payments directly through their websites—register for an online account and connect your checking account so you can schedule payments. Another option is to use the online bill-pay service through your checking account to pay for your mortgage. Make sure to find out how far in advance you need to schedule your payment so your loan servicer receives it on time.\nIf your credit is bad, you can still be approved for a mortgage through a Federal Housing Administration Loan with 10% down, as long as your credit score is at least 500. You also may be able to improve your credit more quickly than you think to qualify for a conventional mortgage.\nClosing costs are the fees over and above the property purchase price due at the closing of a real estate transaction. They may include fees related to the mortgage loan origination and underwriting, commissions, taxes, and insurance premiums, as well as title and record filings.\nLenders are prohibited from discriminating against borrowers who are ill or disabled, so they are not allowed to ask questions related to your physical condition. Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, lenders are not allowed to ask if you are planning a family. In the past, this question was used to discriminate against female borrowers because lenders assumed women would quit work when they became pregnant.\nThe longer you can prove income history for self-employment in the same industry, the more likely you are to be approved for a mortgage. As a general rule, you'll want to have at least two years of documented self-employment income at or above the level you need to afford the loan you want.\nFirst, interest rates determine how much we will have to pay to borrow money to buy a property, and they influence the value of real estate. Second, low interest rates tend to increase demand for property, driving up prices, while high interest rates generally do the opposite.\nKey Terms\nPre-Approval Definition\nA mortgage pre-approval is a statement from a lender that a borrower is likely to be approved for a loan of a certain value. It is not a guarantee, as it is based on assumptions and estimates. But it helps borrowers know what they can afford, and it demonstrates to sellers that a buyer is serious, and well-qualified.\nPrepayment Penalty\nThis clause states that a penalty will be assessed if the borrower significantly pays down or pays off the mortgage, often within the first five years of the loan. The penalty protects lenders against losing interest income, and mortgage lenders are required to disclose prepayment penalties at the time of closing on a new mortgage.\nAdjustable Rate Mortgage\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a home loan with an interest rate that can fluctuate periodically based on the performance of a specific benchmark.\nARMs generally have caps that limit how much the interest rate and/or payments can rise per year or over the lifetime of the loan.\nMortgage Interest\nMortgage interest, calculated as a certain percentage of the full mortgage loan, is the interest charged on a loan used to purchase a piece of property. Mortgage interest may be fixed or variable and is compounding.\nMortgage Rate Lock\nA mortgage rate lock guarantees the current rate of interest on a home loan while a home buyer proceeds through the purchase and closing process—it protects borrowers from the potential of rising interest rates during the home buying process. Typically, a rate lock period ranges from 30 to 60 days.\nBuydown Definition\nA buydown is a mortgage financing strategy that lets a buyer obtain a lower interest rate for at least the first few years of the mortgage or possibly its entire life. Buydowns can save homeowners money on interest over the life of the loan. A buydown may involve purchasing discount points against the mortgage loan, which may require an up-front fee.\nPrivate Mortgage Insurance (PMI)\nIf you purchase a home with a down payment of less than 20% of the home's cost, you will likely need to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI). This insurance protects the lender, not the borrower, against potential losses should the home fall into foreclosure. Borrowers can remove PMI when their equity in the home surpasses 20%.\nConventional Mortgage\nA conventional mortgage is simply a mortgage issued by a private lender and not backed or insured by a governmental agency such as the FHA or the USDA.\nMany conventional mortgages are also \"conforming.\" This means they conform to the requirements set by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. These government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) buy mortgages issued by lenders to help the market stay liquid and affordable.\nMortgage Broker\nA mortgage broker brings mortgage borrowers and mortgage lenders together but does not use their own funds to originate mortgages.\nA mortgage broker finds the best lender for the borrower's financial situation and interest-rate needs and later assists with the application and underwriting processes.\nMortgage Closing\nClosing is the final step in home buying when the mortgage becomes official and the title transfers to the new owners. A closing agent, often an attorney or official from a title or mortgage company, oversees the closing process, which usually takes place at a title company or escrow office, although online or remote closing is becoming more popular.\nBest Mortgage Rates\nExplore Mortgage\nNon-Qualified Mortgages: What They Are, How They Work\nTracker Mortgage: What It Is, How It Works\nWhat Percent of Homeowners Have a Mortgage?\nMortgage Renewal: What It Is, How It Works\nPortable Mortgage: What It Is, How It Works\nPrivate Mortgage: What It Is, How It Works\nMortgage Commitment Letter: What It Is, How It Works\nWhat Is a Lifetime Mortgage?

  "text": "Credit & Debt: Managing Both Wisely\nCredit & Debt\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMost lenders use FICO credit scores, although some use a rival credit score called the Vantage score. The type of FICO or Vantage score can vary depending on the type of loan being applied for. For example, lenders use a specific score variation from one of the major score providers for credit cards vs a mortgage or home equity line of credit.\nThe most important components of credit include history of on-time payments, types of credit owned, amounts owed and credit utilization. Another thing that goes into a person’s credit score is the length of credit history, which means the age of the oldest account on file.\nA credit card is a card-based form of payment that has a revolving credit line. It is different from a line of credit that is typically a standalone loan with a set loan amount that can be accessed as needed with a check. Once a check is written against a line of credit principal and interest is paid back in installments.\nCredit scores can be positively or negatively affected by consumer behavior such as paying balances owed on or before the due date, the percentage of utilization of credit lines and the number of credit accounts that are open.\nLenders report the opening and maintenance of credit accounts to credit reporting companies each month that accounts are open. Account balances, payment behavior and account status (such as current, overdue or in default) are also reported.\nKey Terms\nCredit\nCredit refers to the extension of financial borrowing privileges from one individual or organization to another. Ultimately, credit is based on trust between the lender and borrower that the amount owed will be repaid. Credit generally entails measurement and verification of the creditworthiness of the borrower by the lender.\nHard Inquiry\nA hard inquiry refers to a lender pulling a full credit report on an individual from a credit reporting company in order to determine their creditworthiness for a loan or revolving line of credit. A hard inquiry can temporarily lower the credit applicant’s credit score as where a soft inquiry, which entails a more cursory view of a borrower’s credit, does not.\nCredit Rating\nCredit rating generally refers to an individual’s creditworthiness as measured by a credit score. It can also apply to corporate entities as it relates to the ability of a company to borrow money in the capital markets or issue debt instruments such as corporate bonds.\nCredit History\nCredit history is the accumulated credit account behavior of an individual that is tracked by credit reporting agencies. Lenders such as banks and credit card issuers report their customers’ accounts, credit usage and payment behavior to credit reporting agencies such as Experian, Equifax and TransUnion each month, forming credit profiles.\nCredit Quality\nCredit quality is another term for creditworthiness, meaning the level at which lenders assign credit amounts and terms based on risk level. Banks and other types of lenders measure credit quality objectively using credit scores based on factors such as types of credit owned, on-time payment history, credit utilization and age of credit.\nBuy Now, Pay Later\nBuy Now, Pay Later, also known as BNPL, is a relatively recent take on the old layaway plans of the past. However, unlike layaway plans, Buy Now, Pay Later allows the buyer to take possession of the goods immediately and break up payments into four equal installments over a short period of time.\nExplore Credit & Debt\nHow To Get and Use an Annual Credit Report\nAverage Credit Scores by Gender\nAverage Credit Scores by Race\nAverage Credit Scores by Generation\nFICO Score vs. Other Credit Scores\nHow To Improve Your Credit Score With No Credit History\nHow to Check Your Credit Score Without Hurting It\nAverage Credit Score by State\nHow We Review and Rate Credit Repair Companies\nBy\nIsaac Braun and Brendan Harkness\nUpdated Nov 01, 2024 \nHow to Lock Your Credit Report\nHow to Freeze and Unfreeze Your Credit\nHow to Load Your Walmart Money Card\nRevolving Credit vs. Line of Credit: What's the Difference?\nIs Getting a Free Credit Report Safe?\nClosed-End Credit vs. an Open-End Line of Credit: What's the Difference?\nHow Credit is Scored/Rated for Individuals, Companies, and Governments\nSubprime Market: Meaning, History, Crisis\nInterest Cost: What it Means, How it Works\nLoan Grading: What it is and how it Works\nExperian vs. Equifax: What's the Difference?\n9 Reasons to Say No to Credit\nLines of Credit: When to Use Them and When to Avoid Them\n11th District Cost of Funds Index: What It is, How It Works\nCredit Insurance: Definition, Purpose, Types, and Drawbacks\nCredit Denial: What it Means, How it Works, Example\nBona Fide Error: What It Is, How It Works, Example\nFinancing Entity: Meaning, Regulation, Pros and Cons\nWhat Is the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA)?

In contrast, the money market accounts featured here are offered by banks and credit unions, and they operate as a hybrid between savings and checking accounts. Aside from any fees you incur, your funds cannot lose value.\nBest Money Market Account Rates \nThe best money market account rates in the country are listed below in order of APY.

The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means money market account rates will decline after reaching heights not seen in more than 20 years.234\nWhat Is a Money Market Account? \nA money market account is a type of bank account that pays a better interest rate than what you can earn on the money in your checking account (which typically pays no interest) or in a regular savings account. That makes it a great place to move some of the funds that you don't need on an everyday basis, boosting the amount of interest you earn over the course of each month. \nMoney market accounts are smart for anyone who wants to earn a high-yield interest rate, but also wants check-writing privileges. Though you may not be able to find a money market APY quite as high as the best savings account, you can often get close, while adding an additional way to withdraw your funds. \nInterest rates on money markets are variable and can change over time. They are not fixed like with a CD. They are more like a savings or checking account where the rate is variable and the account is liquid. That means you can deposit and withdraw funds more or less as you choose. But unlike a savings account, money market accounts give you the option to write checks, making them a sort of hybrid between savings and checking accounts. \nWarning\nDon't assume that because an account has the words \"money market\" in its name that it is a true money market account with check-writing privileges. In recent years, financial institutions have started to use the phrase \"money market\" as a marketing term, sometimes applied to accounts with no check-writing abilities and therefore they are essentially high-yield savings accounts.\nPros and Cons of Money Market Accounts \nPros\nYour balance earns interest\nWithdraw and deposit when you like\nOffers virtually risk-free safety\nIf rates rise, your APY could increase\nCons\nScoring a high APY may require opening an account at another bank\nEasy access to your money can make it tempting to spend\nIf rates drop, your APY could be lowered\nPros Explained \nYour balance earns interest: Unlike a typical checking account, your balance in a money market will earn an annual percentage yield (APY), usually paid to you at the end of each monthly statement cycle.\nAllows withdrawals and deposits when you like: You can deposit money into a money market account at any time, and you can generally withdraw it when you like. Some accounts limit your withdrawals to six per month, but many accounts no longer have this restriction.\nOffers virtually risk-free safety: You cannot lose money on a money market account, and if you open it at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, your deposits are federally insured in the unlikely scenario that the institution fails.\nIf rates rise, your APY could increase: Like a savings account, money market accounts pay a variable rate, which means the APY may rise when interest rates are on an upswing.\nCons Explained \nScoring a high yield may require opening an account at another bank: To earn a leading rate on a money market account, you'll need to shop around. And the odds are high that scoring a top rate will require opening a money market account at a bank different than where you already have a checking and savings account.\nEasy access to your money can make it tempting to spend it: Because you can withdraw funds from a money market at any time, there is little to stop the temptation of pulling out money and spending it.\nIf rates drop, your APY could be lowered: When interest rates are dropping, the rate on your money market account is likely to be reduced.\nExpert Take\n\"Though there’s no way to know how much the Fed will ultimately lower rates—or how long they’ll keep cutting—we’re likely to see at least one more rate reduction this year, and then more cuts next year. That could lower the Fed rate a full percentage point or two, which would push rates on money market accounts down by a roughly similar amount.\" ~Sabrina Karl, Investopedia Staff Writer\nHow Much Can You Earn in a Money Market Account?\nA money market account pays interest, just like a savings account. Money market accounts tend to pay higher rates than traditional savings accounts; their rates are on par with high-yield savings account rates. Here's an example of how much you could make in a money market account compared to a traditional savings account if you were to deposit $1,000 and then contribute $250 per month for one year: \nYou could earn $120.64 more in interest in a money market account compared to a traditional savings account. \nHow to Choose the Best Money Market Account for You \nThe best money market account for you will be one that pays a competitive interest rate and has account requirements that will work for you. Some of the account features you'll want to consider are: \nAn opening deposit minimum\nAn ongoing balance requirement\nAny monthly maintenance fees\nThe number of withdrawals you'll be allowed to make per month\nWhether an ATM card is provided and can be used for cash withdrawals\nTo determine which of the factors above are the most important to you, think about how you expect to use the account, such as the minimum balance you feel confident you can maintain and how often you'll want to take funds out of the account. \nTip\nIf you've never opened an account somewhere other than your primary bank or credit union, you may worry that top-paying small institutions or online-only banks are riskier, or that it will be inconvenient. Fortunately, your funds are as protected as they are at any federally insured institution, regardless of size or whether it has branches. And though transferring funds between institutions can take one to three days, today's online banking systems make transfers very easy.\nHow to Open a Money Market Account \nOnce you've decided which money market account is best for you, opening the account should be pretty straightforward and will follow the same process as opening a savings or checking account. \nStart the online account opening process: Most institutions allow online account opening, so look for an \"Open Account\" button or a link on the institution's website.\nProvide personal information: Fill in all of the information asked of you on the online application. Note that you'll be asked security questions to confirm your identity.\nUpload required documents: The process varies from institution to institution, but most will ask you to provide a copy of identification, such as a photo or scan of your driver's license. Some banks will ask for this within the online account opening process, while others may ask you to upload it or send it via secure message after you've submitted your application.\nFund the account: Adding money your account may need to take place at the same time as you open the account, or may be able to be done later. If the money market account has a required opening deposit, you'll be asked toward the end of the application process how you'll fund your account. The most common way is via an ACH transfer from another bank, but other methods include a wire from another bank, sending in a paper check, or sometimes even charging a credit or debit card.\nRegister for online banking: Once you've completed the account application, some banks will make online banking immediately available to you. But others may require some time to fully approve your application, providing the info you need for online banking within a few days of your completion of the application.\nWondering why these accounts are called money markets? It has to do with their highly accessible funds, which can be turned into cash very quickly. Hence the term \"money market.\"\nAlternatives to Money Market Accounts \nHere are a few additional options to consider instead of, or in addition to, putting funds in a money market account. \nTraditional Savings Account: Because traditional savings account tend to pay modest rates, a primary advantage of money market accounts is their higher return. A money market account may require a larger initial deposit or ongoing balance—or both—than a standard savings account, but that is not always the case so it's useful to shop around. Money market accounts will also allow you to write checks, which traditional savings accounts do not offer.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account: High-yield savings accounts and money market accounts are fairly interchangeable, with the only specific difference being that money market accounts offer check-writing. If you don't care so much about having paper checks you can write from your savings, then it's smart to also shop the best high-yield savings accounts, as they often pay higher APYs.\nCertificate of Deposit (CD): If you know you can live without a portion of your savings for months or years, you can often earn more by opening a certificate of deposit (CD). That's because banks and credit unions typically offer a higher APY on CDs in exchange for your agreement that you'll keep the funds in the CD until it matures. Another advantage of CDs is that their rate is fixed. If interest rates drop in the future, your money market rate will drop as well, but a CD rate is locked for the full CD term. Note that early withdrawals from a CD will trigger a penalty, but for some, this is a useful tool for thwarting the temptation to spend your savings.\nU.S. Savings Bonds: Another option for your cash savings is U.S. savings bonds. EE bonds offer a fixed interest rate that you'll know at the time of making your deposit decision, while I bonds offer a rate that changes every six months based on current inflation levels (hence, the name I bonds). These investments are exceptionally safe, but note that they do not, for any reason, allow a withdrawal within the first 12 months.5\nU.S. Treasuries: You could also consider a U.S. Treasury bill. T-bills allow you to lend money to the U.S. government for a short, fixed amount of time. Considered one of the safest investments in the world, T-bills offer durations ranging from four weeks to one year.\nTip\nFor money you know you won't need access to for a while, also consider one of the options in our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs. You may be able to earn a higher APY than with a savings or money market account, and your rate will be locked for the full duration of the CD term.\nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia has been researching bank deposit rates from over 200 nationwide banks and credit unions every weekday since 2019. We have been publishing our ranking of the best money market accounts since 2021. When ranking money market accounts, we ensure the institutions meet our requirement of being federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA, and we research the basic account features, such as minimum required balances, any fees, and other factors that will help readers choose the account that will best meet their needs. Launched in 1999, Investopedia has been helping readers find the best savings account and CD rates since 2019, and the best money market accounts since 2021.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre Money Market Accounts Safe? Are They FDIC Insured?\nMoney market accounts are an exceptionally safe place to keep your funds. First, every money market account in our rankings is federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)—or for credit unions, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)—with coverage up to $250,000 per depositor and per institution. FDIC and NCUA insurance works exactly the same regardless of the size of the institution. So banking with a bigger or smaller bank does not change your risk for deposits up to $250,000.\nSecond, even if your money market account is offered by an online bank, you'll have federal protection there, too. If the bank is simply an online division of an existing brick-and-mortar bank that's FDIC-insured, then the online division is also protected. And even if the bank is internet-only, it likely is an FDIC member as well.\nThird, money market accounts are not investments—they are simply deposit accounts. So the money you put in always belongs to you and cannot lose value, aside from any banking fees you may be charged.\nCan I Use a Money Market Account as My Checking Account?\nA money market generally isn't a substitute for your checking account because many money market accounts limit how many transactions you can make in a month. In addition, not all money market accounts offer ATM or debit cards.\nThough the federal regulation limiting withdrawals to six per month was suspended in 2020, many banks and credit unions still impose withdrawal limits. That's because reducing the transactional costs of these accounts is what enables the bank to offer a higher interest rate. (Note, however, that ATM and in-branch withdrawals are always unlimited.)\nSome money market accounts do offer unlimited withdrawals of all types. So if that's important to you, be sure to research account features before making a final choice.\nWhat Is a Good Money Market Account Rate?\nA good money market account rate is anything over 4.00% right now. The rate on a money market account is variable and can change over time. Across 2022 and 2023, rates surged due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive inflation-fighting campaign, resulting in the top money market accounts paying over 5.00%. But before the Fed's campaign, the best rates were less than 1%. What the future holds for money market rates is unpredictable, but if you shop from our daily ranking, you'll know you're choosing from the best currently available rates.\nHow Much Can I Earn on $10,000 in a Money Market Account? What About $100,000?\nYour earnings from a money market account depend on the average daily balance you hold in the account and the exact APY your account is paying. But we can make an estimate of what you'd earn if we assume an interest rate of 5.00% APY. On a $10,000 balance held in the account for one year, your earnings would be approximately $500, or roughly $41 per month. If you're lucky enough to have a $100,000 balance in the account, your earnings would be about $5,000 for the year, or about $416 per month.\nDo You Pay Taxes on Money in a Money Market Account?\nYou don't pay taxes on the money you deposit into a money market account, but instead, on the interest you earn. Interest earned in money market accounts, savings accounts, CDs, and high-yield checking and savings accounts is subject to taxes when it's a total of $10 or more.6\nWhat Is the Downside of a Money Market Account?\nThe biggest drawback to putting your savings in a money market account is that the rate is not guaranteed. What you earn will be at the mercy of general interest rate fluctuations, so your money market rate can be expected to fall once the Federal Reserve starts lowering the federal funds rate. In contrast, money put in a CD will earn a fixed and guaranteed rate until the end of the certificate's term.\nSome money market accounts put a limit on the number of withdrawals you can make. If you choose one of these accounts with restrictions, a downside could be that you're not able to withdraw funds as freely each month as you may like.\nWhat If I Want to Hold More than $250,000 in Money Market Accounts?\nFor those with a lot of cash on hand that they want to keep liquid while still earning a return, there are various ways to have more than $250,000 covered by federal FDIC insurance. The easiest is by holding your deposits in more than one name (like yours and your spouse's), in more than one FDIC institutions, or both.\nThe FDIC coverage limit applies per person and per institution. So that means if you and your spouse each have accounts at an FDIC bank (in your own names, not jointly held), you would have coverage up to $500,000. Alternatively, if you want to keep all the funds in your own name, you can put up to $250,000 in more than one bank.\nJust remember: All your deposit accounts at a bank count toward the same $250,000 limit, so you'll need to tally up your balances of checking, savings, CD, and money market accounts to know how close you are to the $250,000 cap.\nWhat Will Happen to Money Market Rates in 2025?\nMoney market account rates are variable and can change over time. Like with savings and CDs, they are influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. When the fed funds rate is high, money market accounts are more likely to be high. When the fed cuts rates, they are likely to decline. With the Fed expected to make rate cuts in both 2024 and 2025 now that inflation is under control, money market account rates will be lower in 2025 than they were in 2023 and 2024.7\nBanks We Reviewed\nWe regularly review the rates of the following FDIC banks and NCUA credit unions: 5Star Bank, All America Bank, Ally Bank, Amalgamated Bank, American Heritage Credit Union, BankUnited, Bellco Credit Union, Bethpage Federal Credit Union, BluPeak Credit Union, Brilliant Bank, Chevron Federal Credit Union, CIT Bank, ConnectOne Bank, Connexus Credit Union, Dept of Commerce Federal Credit Union, Digital Federal Credit Union, Discover Bank , EverBank, Finworth, First Capital Bank, First Foundation Bank, First Internet Bank, Forbright Bank, Genisys Credit Union, Hanscom Federal Credit Union, Hughes Federal Credit Union, Ideal Credit Union, KS StateBank, Latino Federal Credit Union, Luana Savings Bank, Merchants Bank of Indiana, Mountain America Credit Union, MutualOne Bank, My eBanc, MYSB Direct, Nationwide by Axos, nbkc bank, Northern Bank Direct, Northpointe Bank, Pen Air Credit Union, PenFed Credit Union, Presidential Bank, Prime Alliance Bank, Princeton Federal Credit Union, PSECredit Union, Quontic Bank, Redneck Bank, Republic Bank of Chicago, Sallie Mae Bank, Seattle Bank, Self-Help Federal Credit Union, Spectrum Federal Credit Union, Summit Credit Union, Synchrony Bank, TAB Bank, The Federal Savings Bank, UFB Direct, U.S. Bank, USAlliance Financial, Utah First Federal Credit Union, Webster Bank, and Zeal Credit Union.\nHow We Find the Best Money Market Account Rates \nEvery business day, Investopedia researchers and fact-checkers track the rate data of more than 60 banks and credit unions that offer money market accounts to customers nationwide, resulting in a daily ranking of the top-paying money market accounts. To qualify for our list, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. The account also must allow check-writing. \nBanks and credit unions must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms. \nInvestopedia was founded in 1999, and our coverage of the best money market accounts began in 2019.

PenFed has been in business since 1935, and has headquarters in McLean, Virginia. \nRead our full PenFed Auto Loans Review for more information. \nTerms and Borrower Qualifications \nUsed loan terms: 3–7 years\nAvailable in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nMust join the credit union by depositing at least $5 in a savings account.\nVehicle Qualifications \nFor loans less than seven years: No limit on vehicle age, and must have 125,000 miles or fewer\nFor loans of seven years or more: Vehicle must be less than five years old and be under 60,000 miles\nMaximum loan-to-value ratio: 125%\nAllows private-party vehicle purchases: Yes\nBest for Bad Credit/Low Rates : AUTOPAY \nAutoPay\nUsed APR Range: As low as 5.69%\nUsed Loan Amounts: $2,500–$100,000\nMinimum Recommended Credit Score: 500\nPros & Cons \nPros\nRelatively low rates\nNo payments for 45 days\nLow minimum credit score requirement\nCons\nVery sparse on loan details\nDoesn’t disclose partner lenders\nCan’t apply with a co-signer, only a co-borrower\nWhy We Chose It \nAUTOPAY is a loan aggregator and it's a bit light on the details; maybe intentional in order to get you to bite. If you have excellent borrower qualifications, AUTOPAY certainly has the potential to be one of your cheapest financing options, advertising some of the best car loan rates today compared to other lenders and aggregators. \nIt's our top pick for bad credit because it works with borrowers with credit scores as low as 500; but it doesn’t specify the top end of the rate range you’d be likely to pay if you have poor credit, so you’ll need to be careful—especially since you can’t apply with a co-signer (only a co-borrower). But, if you do have good credit, you may enjoy some very good interest rates. \nAUTOPAY does offer a full suite of auto loan types: used cars, new cars, refinances, cash-out refinances, and even lease buyout loans. It works with a network of partner lenders rather than offering the loans itself, and that’s how it can offer so much flexibility. For that reason, it’s a good choice to add to your shopping list, although we would prefer if it offered more concrete details. \nAUTOPAY was founded in 2007, and is based in Denver, Colorado. You can get in touch with the company by phone or online message. Read more in our full AUTOPAY auto loans review. \nThe best auto loan rates are often advertised through third-party companies that network with partner lenders, like AUTOPAY. Most of those networks don’t disclose their partners, however, so you can’t always see all of the companies you’re actually checking your rates with. You may need to sign up for automatic payments to get the best rates, as well.\nTerms and Borrower Qualifications \nUsed loan terms: 2–8 years\nRecommended credit score of 500 or higher\nAvailable in all U.S. states and Washington, D.C.\nVehicle Qualifications \nMaximum accepted vehicle age: 10 years\nMaximum accepted mileage: 150,000 miles\nMaximum loan-to-value ratio: Not disclosed\nAllows private-party vehicle purchases: Yes\nBest Credit Union : Consumers Credit Union \nConsumers Credit Union\nUsed APR Range: As low as 5.49%\nUsed Loan Amounts: $500–$350,000\nMinimum Recommended Credit Score: Not disclosed\nPros & Cons \nPros\nAllows co-signers\nNo age or mileage restrictions\nOffers a full suite of car loan options\nCons\nCan only be used at a dealership\nMust join credit union to receive loan\nLack of transparency about loan requirements\nWhy We Chose It \nAs our highest-rated credit union, Consumers Credit Union is a good choice for people who prefer to bank with these financial institutions. It’s also a good choice if you’re trying to buy an older car from a dealership because it’s one of the few lenders that doesn’t put any limits on your vehicle’s model year or mileage. \nConsumers CU also offers an optional mechanical repair insurance plan through ForeverCar, which might be especially important if you are driving an older car. It also has a relatively low minimum loan amount. \nConsumers CU doesn’t specify what sort of credit history you need to qualify for a loan (or any other qualifications, really), but it might be good to add this one to your shopping list if you have bad credit. The maximum rate you’ll pay for a refinance loan, for example, is about half of what some other lenders may charge. \nCustomer support is available by phone, email, or live online chat. \nConsumers Credit Union was chartered in 1930, and has corporate headquarters in Round Lake Beach, Illinois.

You can also expect a lot of companies reaching out to you with spam, too. \nStill, it’s a great option if you’re looking for a car loan refinance, advertising competitively low rates. You’ll just need to make sure you have plenty of equity in your vehicle since LendingTree lenders don’t offer loans with a loan-to-value ratio above 80%. That means underwater loans aren’t eligible for refinancing. \nYou can contact LendingTree by phone, but if you used LendingTree to get a loan with a partner lender you'll likely need to contact that lender instead. LendingTree was founded in 1996, and now has headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nRead more in our full LendingTree Auto Loans Review. \nTerms and Borrower Qualifications \nRefinance loan terms: 36–72 months\nAvailable to residents of all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nVehicle Qualifications \nMaximum accepted vehicle age: None\nMaximum accepted mileage: None\nMaximum loan-to-value ratio: 80%\nAllows private-party vehicle purchases: Not disclosed\nBest for Fair Credit : LendingClub \nLendingClub\nRefinance APR Range: 4.99%–24.99%\nRefinance Loan Amounts: $4,000–$55,000\nMinimum Recommended Credit Score: 600\nPros & Cons \nPros\nMinimum recommended credit score of 600\nNo loan fees\nCan refinance with the same lender\nLow rates for well-qualified borrowers\nCons\nDoesn’t allow co-signers\nMany residency and car restrictions\nDoesn’t offer new or used auto loans\nWhy We Chose It \nLendingClub, the former peer-to-peer lender, is now in the auto refinance business where it offers very good rates to borrowers with good credit. Borrowers with fair credit can be approved too—making it our top pick for this category, along with its high overall score as well—but if your credit is quite bad LendingTree may charge you a higher rate than most other lenders. On the bright side, LendingClub doesn’t charge any fees—origination fees, late fees, prepayment penalties, nothing. \nLendingClub is one of a handful of lenders that allow you to refinance your current LendingClub loan with another LendingClub loan, if you happen to qualify. However, be aware that there are many loan limitations with this lender. It’s not available in many sparsely populated states, for example, and there are many makes and models of popular cars LendingClub won’t finance. \nLendingClub was incorporated in 2007, and it's headquartered in San Francisco, California. \nIf you're dealing with less-than-perfect credit, see our picks for the best auto loans for fair credit to explore further options. \nTerms and Borrower Qualifications \nRefinance loan terms: 2–7 years\n600 or higher recommended credit score\nCurrent auto loan must have been open for at least one month\nCurrent auto loan must have at least 24 months remaining\nAvailable to residents of all U.S. states except for: Alaska, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming\nYou must be at least 18 years of age\nYou must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or live in the U.S. on a valid long-term visa\nVehicle Qualifications \nMaximum accepted vehicle age: 10 years\nMaximum accepted mileage: 120,000 miles\nMaximum loan-to-value ratio: Not disclosed\nAllows private-party vehicle purchases: No\nIn addition: \nThe loan’s remaining balance must be between $5,000 and $55,000\nCan’t refinance business vehicles\nVehicle must be registered in the same state you live\nMany cars not eligible for financing, such as Nissan Leafs and models from Suzuki, Saturn, Mercury, Saab, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Hummer, and more\nBest for Full Car Buying Experience : Carvana \nCarvana\nAPR Range: Not disclosed\nLoan Amounts: Not disclosed\nMinimum Credit Score: 500\nPros & Cons \nPros\nNeat, techy way to buy a car\nOffers seven-day return policy\nLong 45-day pre-approval window\nCons\nNot available outside of contiguous U.S.\nDoesn’t allow co-borrowers, only co-signers\nDelivery charges not refundable if you return car\nWhy We Chose It \nCarvana is a used car dealership that offers a completely online car-buying experience, similar to TrueCar; it's our highest-rated company that offers this service. You can apply for an auto loan online, find a car, and then pick it up or even have it delivered to you. \nOne of Carvana’s claims to fame, however, is its car vending machines. If you’re pre-approved for a loan you can schedule an appointment to take a car for a test drive from one of its giant vending machines. The company will even provide you with a token to use. If you like the car, you can keep it. If not, you’ll have seven days to return it. \nIt’s a futuristic way to buy a car that many people like; however, there can be problems with the setup. If you have a car delivered and you don’t like it, for example, you can return it, but the shipping charge is nonrefundable. That makes it costly and impractical to test drive different models like you would at a dealership. \nCarvana's customer support team is available by text or by live chat on the website, and there's a mobile app you can download for iPhone and Android. The company was founded in 2012, and is based in Tempe, Arizona.

But it can be helpful if you’re struggling to make your auto loan payments and you’re not able to qualify for a better loan with another lender—especially if you need to refinance a loan for a high-mileage car, because OpenRoad Lending's 160,000 mile-limit is the highest disclosed limit among lenders we reviewed. \nIt comes with very high origination fees ranging from $249 to $449, a 5% late payment fee, and interest rates that zoom into credit-card-debt territory for less-qualified borrowers.1 \nHowever, OpenRoad Lending is still better than many other types of alternative auto loans, such as those from buy-here-pay-here lenders. You can still qualify if you have a poor credit score, even if you’re underwater on your current loan—a common problem for people with bad car loans. \nOpenRoad Lending has a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 180%, meaning you may be able to borrow nearly twice your car’s actual value in order to pay off your existing loan—far more than most other lenders. \nOpenRoad Lending was founded in 2009, and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. \nIf you need help, you can get in touch with OpenRoad by phone or email. Read more in our full OpenRoad Lending Auto Loans Review. \nTerms and Borrower Qualifications \nRefinance loan terms: 24–72 months\nMinimum credit score of 500 \nMust be at least 18 years old\nAvailable to residents in 46 U.S. states\nYou must make at least $2,000 per month (earnings from Uber or similar services do not count toward the income requirement) \nYour DTI cannot exceed 40%\nCan only refinance auto loans issued by NCUA- or FDIC-insured lenders such as credit unions and banks\nVehicle Qualifications \nMaximum accepted vehicle age: Not disclosed\nMaximum accepted mileage: 160,000 miles\nMaximum loan-to-value ratio: 175%\nAllows private-party vehicle purchases: No\nBusiness vehicles, Oldsmobile, Daewoo, Smart Car, and Isuzu vehicles are not eligible for refinancing\nThe Bottom Line \nIf you’re looking for the best overall auto loans, try starting with PenFed; it's a credit union, but anyone can join for just $5 when approved for a loan. AUTOPAY is worth checking as well, especially if you'd like to browse a variety of lenders. LendingTree is also a top choice for a rate-comparison website, while LendingClub can help people with fair credit get financing. If you prefer sticking with credit unions, Consumers Credit Union is yet another good option that allows anyone to apply. \nOr, if you’re not too picky about your car and prefer a more streamlined experience, Carvana offers some unique and affordable financing options. And finally, while expensive, OpenRoad Lending offers a lot of potential if you’re looking to get out of a car loan with a high rate. \nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia collected 1,176 key data points from 21 companies across three months to identify the most important factors for readers choosing an auto loan.

Auto loans are usually secured, which means the vehicle serves as collateral for the loan. If you fail to make monthly car payments as agreed, the lender can seize the vehicle. \nYou can use a personal loan to make a car purchase, but secured auto loans typically have lower rates because lenders have more security if you don't pay as agreed. \nAuto loan lenders may allow you to borrow more than the purchase price of the car, to account for taxes, fees, dealer upgrades, and other add-ons.\nLike other installment loans, when you borrow money with an auto loan the funds are provided in a lump sum. The borrower makes equal monthly installment payments until the term loan is paid off. The money is lent at interest, so the borrower ends up paying back more than they originally borrow. \nFor many people, getting an auto loan is a crucial step in the car buying process: Over 80% of new cars and over 37% of used cars were financed in Q1 of 2024.2\nAuto Loan Rates \nNo matter the price of the car, the interest rate of your loan plays a major part in the overall cost you pay. Dealerships will often try to sell you on a loan through their partners, and you may find a good deal this way. But you might save thousands over the course of the loan if you can find a better rate yourself through an independent lender, so it's worth shopping around. \nLonger loan terms may come with a lower monthly payment and lower annual percentage rates (APRs), but don't be fooled. In general, it's best to choose the shortest term and the highest monthly payments you can afford. \nAlthough long-term loans may come with lower monthly payments, making them more affordable on a month-by-month basis, shorter-term loans will make the overall cost less expensive because you accrue less interest. When the loan is fully paid off, the vehicle belongs to the borrower (instead of the lender). \nWhere to Get an Auto Loan \nAuto loans are available from traditional banks, online banks, credit unions, and lending marketplaces (which partner with banks and credit unions). You'll find new, used, and refinance auto loans from all of those sources, although some lenders only offer certain loan types; some lenders offer special deals for first-time car buyers, as well. \nAuto loans are also available through dealerships that partner with banks; in some cases you may find lower rates through a dealership, but it's worth getting pre-approved with lenders on your own to see what kind of rates you can get. Then, you can go to the dealership with some bargaining power—see if the dealer will beat the best rate you found on your own. \nLearn more in our expert explanation of how auto loans work. \nTypes of Auto Loans \nSome people choose the type of car they get based on the type of loan they'd like. For example, new cars are more expensive, but the loans are often much cheaper than for used cars—and that’s one reason many people prefer new cars over used cars. \nNew car loan: Just about every lender offers new car loans. They feature lower rates and may come with longer term lengths since you’ll likely be financing a car that costs more, given the higher price tag for new cars.\nUsed car loan: Equally common, the rates on used car loans are generally a bit higher. Lenders may have more restrictions in place for loan approval, such as only being able to buy used cars from dealerships or cars below a certain age or mileage level.\nAuto refinance loan: Many lenders offer refinance loans, which are used to pay off your current loan contract, replacing it with a new one. You might do this to get lower monthly payments and/or to pay off your loan faster while saving money.\nCash-out refinance: A cash-out refinance works the same as above, except you borrow a higher amount of money than you need. You get the difference back as cash that you can use for other things, like home repairs or debt consolidation. \nAuto title loan: These are similar to payday loans except your paid-off (or mostly paid-off) car serves as loan collateral. Auto title loans are extremely expensive and difficult to repay, resulting in some borrowers having their car repossessed, so we don't recommend them.\nBuy-here-pay-here loan: These dealerships market to people with bad credit. Your car may come installed with a tracking device to make it easier to repossess, and you may be charged exorbitantly high rates. We don’t recommend buy-here-pay-here loans.\nLease buyout loan: It can be difficult and expensive to get out of a car lease contract early so you’ll need to calculate the costs for all of your options carefully. If you can’t pay cash, some lenders offer a lease buyout loan for this purpose.\nPrivate party auto loan: A private party auto loan is used to purchase a vehicle from a private seller—i.e., not a car dealership or business. Only some lenders provide loans for private party purchases.\nBad credit car loans: Some lenders offer auto loans of various kinds for people with poor credit; these loans are just like any other kind of loan, but they typically come with higher interest rates and fees.\nAuto loans can either be secured or unsecured. Most auto loans are secured by the very car you’re buying and offer lower rates because of that. Your car serves as collateral for the loan and if you don’t repay it, the lender will repossess your car. \nUnsecured car loans aren’t as common, but some lenders (like LightStream) do offer them. They’re often faster to get but they charge much higher rates because the lender doesn’t have an easy way to get their money back if you default. \nHow to Get the Lowest Interest Rates On Your Auto Loan\nAuto loan rates depend in part on the federal prime rate, but the borrower's qualifications play a large role as well. \nShop around: Different lenders offer different interest rates; seek out lenders with low minimum APRs and get pre-approved to check your rates.\nBuild your credit: There are many ways to improve your credit score—some can be quick, like reducing your credit utilization, while others can take some time, like building up a history of on-time payments.\nIncrease your income: Having more money available (either for a down payment or for monthly payments) can improve your odds of getting a good rate.\nPre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval\nWhen it comes to auto loans, pre-qualification and pre-approval usually mean different things. But it's important to realize that some lenders and advice columns may use the terms interchangeably. \nPre-qualification generally involves a lighter, less extensive check than pre-approval. Pre-qualification may only require some basic personal information, and the lender may perform a soft credit check, which has no effect on your credit score. Information provided for a pre-qualification won't be verified by the lender—it's just meant to give you an idea of the rate you may qualify for. \nPre-approval involves a more in-depth check of your credit and finances. It typically requires a hard credit check, which can slightly affect your credit, and the lender may ask for more information and documentation. The lender may attempt to verify the information, as well.\nNeither pre-qualification nor pre-approval means that you're guaranteed to be approved.\nWhat Are Predatory Auto Loans?\nIn general, predatory lending refers to loans with unfair, deceptive, or abusive terms. These loans may offer borrowers worse terms than they deserve, based on their credit rating, or they may have exorbitantly high fees and/or high interest rates. Predatory lenders may exploit borrowers with aggressive tactics, or they may be outright deceptive. \nBorrowers who lack sufficient understanding are encouraged to take out loans that they likely can't pay back. Lenders might charge high upfront fees so they can make money before the loan defaults. \nBeware of subprime auto loans, car title loans, buy-here-pay-here loans, and payday loans. These may come with very high costs that are above typical market rates. \nSigns of Predatory Auto Loans\nLack of credit check: This isn't always a sign of a predatory loan, but lenders may offer loans with no credit check to entice borrowers who wouldn't otherwise be able to qualify.\nLoan packing: If you get a loan through a dealership, in some cases the dealership may include unwanted add-ons or services that increase the overall cost of the loan. These add-ons may even be added to the terms without your knowledge. Be sure to read the contract and fine print carefully before signing a car loan contract.\nHigh-pressure sales tactics: Car salespeople are known for their sales tactics, but the final decision to sign any paperwork is up to you. Once again, be sure to read the fine print carefully. Come to the dealership or auto loan lender with your own plan in mind, and don't allow yourself to be pressured into buying anything you don't want or can't afford.\nAbove-market APRs or fees: Make sure you understand the full cost of the loan, including any closing costs and the costs of any extra features or services, the APR, the upfront and monthly payments you'll have to make, and the term length of the loan. Taking the time to shop around with different auto loan lenders can help ensure you find the best deal possible for your financial and credit situation.\nYo-yo auto loans: A \"yo-yo\" loan is when a dealership entices you with a certain set of terms, perhaps allowing you to test drive a car and get used to the idea of owning it, but later reneges on the agreement and says you have to sign new, worse terms—such as a higher APR—or you won't be able to get the vehicle.\nExtra-large down payments: Car purchases (as opposed to leases) usually require a down payment, but if a lender or dealership requires a very large down payment (such as 40%–50% of the car value) they may be trying to get as much money out of you as quickly as possible because they suspect you may default on the loan.\nBalloon payments: Balloon payments are extra-large required payments that come at the end of a loan term. These help make the previous monthly payments smaller, making the loan more attractive, but they can come as a surprise and in some cases people may not be able to pay them.\nAsset-based lending or equity stripping: Rather than offering a loan using the vehicle as collateral, as usual, a lender may want you to borrow against some other equity you hold, such as your home. The lender can collect upfront fees and monthly payments, and then if you fail to pay back the loan as agreed, they can claim the equity used as collateral for the loan.\nAuto Loan Rates by Credit Score \nHow to Apply for an Auto Loan \nYou can get an auto loan from several different types of lenders: online lenders, banks, and credit unions. Dealerships themselves also partner with these lenders to offer you financing.\nIt’s best to do your loan shopping before you actually start looking for a car, because you can take the time to find the best loan options and you’ll have more bargaining power when you do find the car you want.\nEach lender will check two things in order to approve your loan: your financial situation and the car you want to buy.\nYou can start the loan shopping process by getting pre-approved with multiple lenders. This may require a hard credit inquiry, in some cases. Chances are, some lenders will offer lower rates than others.\nIf you’re pre-approved based on the initial details you provide, including personal details like Social Security number and some financial details, the lender will let you know what rates and terms you’re likely to qualify for.\nLenders look for a few things. Your credit score, income, and debt payments are three of the most important factors, so it’s a good idea to clean up your credit in advance if it needs work and you have the time. Consider ways to reduce your debt-to-income ratio.\nIf you’re not able to qualify on your own and you have someone who’s willing to help, applying with a co-signer can improve your odds of qualifying for a loan. \n“When my wife and I were shopping for a car last year, we prepared by getting a pre-qualification from our bank—Bank of America. We did it online, through our account portal. It was really easy, and because we have several accounts with BofA, we qualified for a rate discount. We planned on using the pre-approval as a negotiating tool, and figured the dealer would offer a better rate. To our surprise, the dealer couldn’t beat it. So now we have yet another account with BofA.” — Lars Peterson (Investopedia Senior Editor, Financial Products and Services).\nOnce you find the car you want, you can provide the details to your chosen lender and submit a full loan application. The lender will usually disburse the loan funds directly to you, either by check or bank deposit. In some cases lenders may send the money directly to dealerships; for refinance loans, lenders may send the money directly to the current holder of your loan. \nYour new lender will provide you with details on how to set up an account, manage your loan, and make payments.\nAuto Loan Calculator \nSee how much car you can afford with our auto loan calculator; plug in your details, and you can see how big your monthly payments will be at different terms and interest rates. \nSay you take out a loan for a new 2024 Ford F-150 Platinum with the following details, for example: \nCar price: $64,915\nDown payment: $5,000\nLoan amount: $59,915\nLoan term: 72 months\nCredit: Fair (601–660 credit score)\nInterest rate: 7.14%\nTotal paid over the life of the loan: $73,837.72\nWith those terms, you'd have a monthly loan payment of $1,025.52. If you were to make a larger down payment, such as $8,000, you could take out a smaller loan ($56,915), and your monthly payment would be $974.17. You'd pay less overall: $70,140.59 over the life of the loan.\nIn the News: Auto loan rates are related to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate—if the Fed rate goes up, average auto loan rates usually will, as well. The Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing them by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00% at its Sept. 18, 2024, meeting. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation. Further cuts are expected, which means interest rates (including auto loan rates) will decline.345\nAuto Loans: Pros and Cons \n\nPros \nProvides access to a car: If you need a car to get to work or school and can't afford to buy one with cash, an auto loan can give you that access to the transportation you need.\nSpreads out the expense of a vehicle purchase: Even if you have enough cash to buy a car, auto financing spreads out that expense, so you don’t deplete your savings all at once.\nYou'll own the car: Your lender technically owns the car while you pay down your loan, but once it's paid off, you'll own the car outright. New car leases can save you money with lower monthly payments, but there's no vehicle ownership.\nFlexible loans: Auto loans can offer flexibility with loan amounts and repayment terms to help fit into your budget.\nCan help build credit: Like other installment loans, auto loans can be used to build credit as you make on-time monthly payments.\nCons \nInterest rates can be high: Auto loan rates are lower than what you can expect from a personal loan or credit card. But if your credit isn't in great shape, you can still end up with a high interest rate, which could make monthly payments unaffordable.\nVehicles depreciate: While you're paying down your loan, the value of your vehicle is depreciating. If the vehicle's value is less than what you owe on your loan, you may have to pay the difference when you sell the car or if the vehicle gets totaled in an accident.\nCan damage your credit: If you miss a payment by 30 days or more, it could damage your credit score significantly.\nDefault can result in repossession: If you fail to make payments for a longer period, your lender could repossess the vehicle and sell it to recoup the remaining loan balance. If there's a deficiency after the sale, you may still be on the hook for that debt.\nWhere Are the Big Banks? \nWe included big banks like Chase, Capital One, Bank of America, and U.S. Bank in our review of the auto loan industry, but these financial institutions don't always make our \"Best\" lists. \nWhy? Although these banks are reliable and used by millions of people, they usually don't offer the very best rates and terms. Online banks and lender marketplaces tend to have lower operating costs, and can pass those savings on to borrowers. Big banks tend to score well in our rankings, but they don't usually come out on top when it comes to auto loan interest rates, flexibility in terms, and accessibility. \nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhich Companies Are Best for Car Loans?\nOur top-rated lenders offer the lowest rates on new and used car loans in the auto financing industry—if you've got good credit and you want the best rates, take a look at PenFed, AUTOPAY, Consumers Credit Union, LendingTree, LendingClub, and OpenRoad Lending. You'll also find several good options for refinancing, as well.\nHow Do You Get the Best Car Loan Rate?\nNot everyone qualifies for the best auto loan rates. Here are some things you can do before and during the application process to tip the odds in your favor:6\nCheck your rate with as many lenders as you can (within a short timeframe).\nPay down your existing debt, especially credit card debt.\nCheck your credit score and credit reports, and fix any errors before you apply for a loan.\nUse your loan pre-approval offers to negotiate a lower rate with the dealership.\nWhat Credit Score Do You Need to Qualify for a Car Loan?\nThere is no overall minimum credit score you’ll need to qualify for an auto loan.7 It depends on the company, because lender requirements vary. In general, if you have good or excellent credit (670 or higher), you’ll qualify for the best auto loan rates.8 Lenders typically use an auto-loan specific credit scoring model (like a FICO score or VantageScore). See the best car loans for bad credit if you’re dealing with a lower score.\nIs Auto Loan Interest Tax-Deductible?\nAuto loan interest is not usually tax-deductible, but there is a situation where it may be. If you use a car for business purposes, you may be able to deduct interest that accrues on your auto loan as a business expense (commuting to your job won't typically count). If you use the car for both personal and business purposes, you may be able to claim deductions for business-related expenses (including interest along with other expenses like vehicle maintenance, gas, and insurance). We recommend speaking with a tax attorney to learn about deductions for your specific situation.\nWhen Is the Best Time to Buy a Car?\nUltimately, the best time to buy a car is when you need one. But if you have some flexibility, experts recommend the following times:\nThe end of the month, quarter, or year: Car salespeople often have to meet quotas for each month, quarter, and year, so they may be motivated to make a deal toward the end of those periods to ensure they make the cut.\nThree-day weekends: Dealerships often run sales events for President's Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and other three-day weekends. The same goes for other holidays, such as the Fourth of July and Black Friday.\nThe end of the model year: Dealers may offer deals to get rid of inventory and make way for the latest model. Research when new models are released for the car you want and see if it can help you with negotiations.9\nWhat Is a Good APR for an Auto Loan?\nAccording to a report by Experian in Nov. 2023, average rates for 2023 were 7.03% for new cars and 11.35% for used cars, although rates will have changed somewhat since then. If you get a rate lower than the average, you can generally feel like you're getting a good deal. Your rate will vary depending on your credit score, income, and other factors.10\nWhat Are Used Car Loan Interest Rates?\nBy Nov. 2023, the average interest rate for used cars in 2023 was 11.35%, according to Experian. Here's the average used car loan interest rate for each credit score range:\nSuper prime: 7.43%\nPrime: 9.33%\nNear prime: 13.53%\nSubprime: 18.39%\nDeep subprime: 21.18%10\nCompanies We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed 21 companies to find the best seven lenders you see on the list above.

  "text": "Taxes\nWhat Everyone Needs to Know About Taxes\nFrequently Asked Questions\nJust 5 states don’t impose state sales taxes: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. However, that doesn’t keep them from charging income tax, excise taxes or tourist taxes. And it doesn’t mean that cities or municipalities within those states can’t change a local sales tax.\nThere are complicated rules for how stock-option taxes are calculated, sometimes depending on whether the options the employer granted are statutory stock options—granted under an employee stock purchase plan or an incentive stock option (ISO) plan—or nonstatutory ones. ISO options affect alternative minimum tax and nonstatutory options have three possible tax events, so get the help of a tax advisor to handle stock options issues.\nDocuments around property acquisition and improvements are especially important for capital gains tax when you sell your home; so are documents needed by heirs to establish the cost basis of stocks they inherit.\nStart by using the exclusion for $250,000 of capital gains ($500,000) for married couples if the home was your primary residence for at least two of the last five years. Then look at all the expenditures you made that can reduce the amount of capital gains—for example, capital improvements, settlement fees and closing costs.\nAlternative minimum tax (AMT) is a system invented to make sure that higher income people with significant tax deductions didn’t avoid paying federal income tax. It uses a separate set of rules to calculate the tax owed after adding certain tax preference items back into adjusted gross income (AGI). What you need to do is keep your AGI as low as possible through maximizing salary deferrals and pre-tax contributions to flexible spending plans and the like, keeping tax-efficient investments in taxable investment accounts, and taking all the tax credits of which you qualify.\nSome of these are simple carelessness, such as using the wrong line of the form or entering incorrect figures or names. Others are automatically taking the standard deduction, missing write-offs, making math errors, not telling the IRS what to do with your refund, and making payment mistakes.\nKey Terms\nTax Identification Number\nThis is a nine-digit tracking number used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and is required on all tax returns. It is required information on all tax returns filed with the IRS. The IRS issues all U.S. tax identification numbers (TIN) or tax I.D. numbers. Two tax ID numbes not issued by the IRS: Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and foreign tax identifying numbers (foreign TIN), which are issued by the country in which the non-U.S. taxpayer pays taxes.\nInheritance Tax\nSome states impose these taxes on heirs. Unlike the estate tax, which is paid by the deceased’s estate, this tax is paid by the beneficiary. States that charge inheritance taxes: Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\nThere is no federal inheritance tax.\nExcise Tax\nLargely paid by businesses on goods and services at purchase, these taxes can be ad valorem (a percentage of the cost) or specific (a set dollar amount). Excise taxes levied on goods with a high social cost such as alcohol and tobacco are known as sin taxes. Motor fuels, airline tickets, and health services are other major sources of excise tax revenue.\nIndirect Tax\nThese taxes are paid by the manufacturer or retailer, not the consumer, but are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher costs. Excise taxes on fuel, alcohol, and tobacco are one example of an indirect tax. So are import duties paid by those who import goods from outside the country.\nSales Tax\nA consumption tax imposed on goods and services, a sales tax is paid at the point of sale by the consumer and is collected by the seller. A manufacturer at an interim step in the manufacturing process (say a yarn maker who sells the yarn to a sweater manufacturer) can obtain a certificate of resale to avoid being charged sales tax on the yarn.\nConsumption Tax\nThis is any tax on the purchase of goods and services. Sales taxes, excise taxes and tariffs are all consumption taxes. They are taxes on what you spend, rather than taxes on what you earn (income taxes).\nTax Exempt\nIncome or transactions that aren’t subject to any federal, state, or local tax are tax exempt. Some religious and charitable organizations are also tax exempt. So are earnings from municipal bonds.\nExplore Taxes\nTax Help After Natural Disasters\nBest Tax Apps for November 2024\nWhat Is the Pink Tax?

  "text": "Portfolio Construction\nPortfolio Construction Basics\nFrequently Asked Questions\nSocially Responsible Investing (SRI) refers to the practice of abstaining from certain investments on ethical grounds. SRI practitioners disregard the profit they could make from investing in companies with business practices that conflict with their ethical code. Socially responsible investors might refuse to invest in a company because of its products (e.g., cigarettes or alcohol), its management practices (e.g., covering up or failing to address abuse allegations), or its political affiliations.\nBecause it’s tough to predict exactly when a recession will start, investors should maintain a diversified portfolio at all times to limit losses during market downturns. The safest stocks to own during recessions are those of large, reliably profitable companies with ample cash flow and a track record of weathering turbulence. Companies in consumer staples, which include food, beverages, household goods, and toiletries, are also relatively safe bets during recessions because their products are basic necessities.\nThough the phrase may be “the greater the risk, the greater the reward,” high returns from risky investments are far from guaranteed. It may be more appropriate to say that the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward. Investing in an obscure upstart with a world-changing idea but no track record of success can pay off enormously if that company translates its idea into a viable business, but far more upstarts fail than go on to be the next Apple or Walmart.\nThe expense ratio is the percentage of a mutual fund or ETF’s assets under management that go toward paying the fund’s annual operating expenses, which includes the salary of the fund manager/advisor, recordkeeping fees, taxes, and accounting and auditing fees. These operating expenses reduce the amount of capital in the fund to be invested, which inevitably lowers the fund’s returns. Expense ratios have been trending down for decades. According to an Investment Company Institute report, the average expense ratio for index equity mutual funds fell from 0.27% in 1996 to 0.06% in 2021.\nKey Terms\nRisk Tolerance\nRisk tolerance is an imprecise measure of the amount of risk an investor is willing to accept. A highly risk tolerant investor might buy shares in a start-up that has taken on lots of debt to finance the development of a groundbreaking technology that could prove immensely profitable or go nowhere. Whereas a risk averse investor would stick to government bonds that come with small but guaranteed returns or the stock of a 100-year old company with a household name product that has little runway left for growth.\n80-20 Rule\nThe 80-20 Rule, otherwise known as the Pareto Principle, is an aphorism that posits that 20% of inputs account for 80% of outputs. In the context of portfolio construction, the Pareto Principle holds that 80% of a stock portfolios returns in a ten year period can be attributed to just 20% of the portfolio’s holdings. The 80-20 rule is more of a general trend than a mathematical law and should not be assumed to be universally true.\nAsset Allocation\nAsset allocation refers to the ongoing process of allocating and reallocating money within an investment portfolio to different asset classes. The three main asset classes—equity, fixed-income, and cash and equivalents—all have different levels of risk and expected return. An investor’s risk tolerance and investment horizon help determine how much of their portfolio they apportion to each asset class.\nRebalancing\nRebalancing refers to the periodic buying or selling of assets to restore one’s portfolio to a desired asset allocation. Because assets appreciate at different rates, a portfolio that’s 60% stocks and 40% bonds on January 1st could be 75% stocks and 25% bonds by the end of the year.

As your financial picture evolves, the best credit card for you may also change. While credit card rewards can be valuable, if you’re focused on paying off debt, they may not be the best choice for you at this time. A card that offers a 0% APR promotion for balance transfers may be the better option until you can pay off your debt.\nHowever, the most appealing credit card may not be the best one you can actually get right now. People with low credit scores may be able to qualify only for cards that carry higher interest rates and fewer rewards. Those consumers should focus on building their credit until they are eligible for the credit card they desire.\nPeople with excellent credit generally have their choice of travel and other rewards credit cards. Credit cards aimed at those with the best credit scores typically provide the most attractive benefits. These can include lucrative one-time bonuses, significant ongoing rewards on your spending, and additional benefits like elite status, free checked bags, yearly free hotel nights, and airport lounge access.\nWhat Credit Card Is Best for Me?\nFinding the best credit card entails both self-assessment and research. You must document your creditworthiness and spending habits and reflect on how you may use the card, whether that's to build credit, temporarily borrow, or simply employ it as a purchasing convenience and a way to earn rewards.\nNew to Credit: If you are new to credit or have impaired credit, a secured credit card can be a great option. This type of card requires a security deposit but has the advantage that activity with the card is reported to all three credit bureaus, which helps the cardholder build credit over time. Many secured cards offer an option to graduate to a non-secured card after a period of on-time payments.\nCarrying a Balance: Those who are carrying a card balance should consider shifting the debt to a balance transfer card with much lower interest, or even no interest rate at all for a period. These cards provide relief in the form of an extended period of a 0% APR on the transfer, which allows you to pay down the balance more easily. While some balance transfer cards offer rewards as well, it’s best not to add to your balance on the card (or, preferably, any other card) until you have paid off the amount you’ve transferred.\nIf you frequently carry a credit card balance, avoid cards with high fees and interest regardless of attractive rewards and one-time bonuses. Your priority should be paying down your debt and avoiding accumulating more, not trying to earn rewards.\nNo Balance: People who tend to pay off their card balance each month should consider getting a rewards card that offers cash back or points rewards. These cards allow you to leverage your everyday spending to earn hundreds of dollars worth of rewards, usually with no annual fee.\nFrequent Travelers: For those who travel, a general travel card or one issued in partnership with airlines or hotels can make the most sense. These allow you to leverage spending on travel and in other categories to earn rewards that can be used to obtain further travel.\nEntrepreneurs and Small-business Owners: These users can choose among a host of business credit cards designed for their needs. These cards may reward business spending in certain categories, like shipping, or with specific business-related merchants, such as office supply stores.\nCollege Students: People in school generally don’t have a credit history, but they do represent a good long-term customer for card issuers. Cards designed for students can provide online resources to instruct new cardmembers on the responsible use of credit and other tips to guide personal finances.\nWhat Credit Scores Are Required?\nThe higher your credit score, the more credit cards you potentially have available to you, and the better those cards will tend to be in terms of interest rates, credit lines, and rewards programs. To understand your card choices, it’s important to know the broad range into which your credit score fits. Card issuers classify scores as “Excellent/Exceptional” (800+), “Very Good” (740-799), “Good” (670-739), “Fair” (580-669), or “Poor” (below 580). It’s best to only apply for cards that best match the credit recommended by the issuer to reduce the chances of being declined.\nIf you don’t know your current credit score, it’s available in a number of ways, and at no cost. There are two main credit score types, FICO and VantageScore, both of which have their own distinct scoring algorithms and score ranges that are used by various lenders.\nCredit card issuers also assess other factors beyond credit score in evaluating creditworthiness, including employment status, income, and other credit and deposit accounts you own.\nIs It Possible to Qualify for a Credit Card With Bad Credit?\nThere are credit cards designed for those whose credit is fair, poor, and even very poor or bad. In particular, a secured credit card allows those with bad credit or no credit history to build or rebuild their score. Until they’ve completed that process, they must retain the use of the card through a security deposit that usually serves as the maximum credit line for the account.\nWhat Types of Rewards Do Credit Cards Offer?\nCredit card rewards come in a variety of forms, allowing cardholders to earn cash back, points, or miles for each dollar of spending. The earnings rates for rewards often vary by purchase type, with higher rewards available for certain categories of purchases.\nCash back rewards are the most straightforward type and usually rebate a percentage of spending in the form of a check or statement credit. Rewards based on points or miles offer greater flexibility in how they are redeemed, whether as travel, gift cards, merchandise, or more.\nSome travel credit cards offer rewards for travel in general, which can be redeemed for purchases with any airline of hotel; other travel cards are co-branded with specific airlines or hotels, in which case they offer partner-specific points or miles. Co-branded cards provide less flexibility in redeeming rewards but potentially more value, provided you’re comfortable favoring a particular brand of airline or hotel chain.\nWhat Are Common Credit Card Benefits?\nWhile issuers may prominently tout certain features of their cards, other benefits tend to be buried in cards’ fine print—including some you might not realize the card even offers.\nHere’s a quick list of benefits that are commonly offered with a range of card types:\n\nCommon Rewards Card Benefits\n$0 fraud liability\nPrimary or secondary auto-rental collision damage waiver coverage\nRoadside assistance hotline\nPrice match\nPurchase coverage if items are stolen or damaged\nExtended warranties\nRefunds in cases of merchant dispute\nCommon Travel Rewards Card Benefits\nTrip cancellation/interruption/delay coverage\nTravel accident insurance\nLost/delayed luggage coverage\nPremium Card Benefits\nAirport lounge access\nTSA PreCheck/Global Entry fee reimbursement every four years\nCell phone insurance coverage\nConcierge service\nHow We Rate and Review Credit Cards \nWe constantly monitor credit card offers from card-issuer websites and publicly available sources to find the best credit cards for our readers. Each credit card is evaluated based on its fees, rewards, welcome bonuses, introductory offers, features, and benefits so that we can determine a winner for each category. Card issuers update their cards on a regular basis, and when that happens, we update our card listings, reviews, and recommendations so our readers have the most reliable information and advice. You can also read the full version of our methodology for a more in-depth look at how we assess cards and award them the best in various categories. \nMeet Our Credit Cards Expert\nBen Woolsey is Investopedia's Associate Editorial Director for financial products.

Non-citizens must be in the country legally and have a Social Security number. As with citizens, retirement benefits are only available for workers with a minimum of 40 work credits, which take at least 10 years to accrue. Non-citizens with fewer than 40 credits may be able to count work outside the U.S. toward Social Security credits if their home country and the U.S. have a totalization agreement.\nYes, securities can be donated to qualified organizations as long as they have a brokerage account with which to accept the gift.

  "text": "Credit Cards\nFinding the right credit card is an important personal decision, and one size does not fit all. Whether you're a frequent shopper, savvy saver, strategic traveler, a student just getting started, or a small business owner growing a brand, Investopedia has identified the best credit cards to help you pick the one that fits your individual financial needs while earning rewards. After collecting over 50 data points across more than 300 credit cards, these are the best credit cards for different lifestyles, consumer spending categories, and credit scores. \nBest Overall: Capital One Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit Card\nBest for Cash Back: Capital One Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Credit Card\nBest for Travel: Chase Sapphire Reserve\nBest for Rewards: Chase Sapphire Reserve\nBest Airline Card: United℠ Explorer\nBest Hotel Card: World of Hyatt Credit Card\nBest Balance Transfer Card: Citi® Diamond Preferred® Credit Card\nBest Card for Students: Bank of America® Travel Rewards for Students\nBest Business Card: Ink Business Preferred℠ Credit Card\nBest for Groceries: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express\nBest for Online Shopping: Capital One® SavorOne® Cash Rewards Credit Card\nBest Secured Card: Capital One Platinum Secured\nRead about all of the best credit cards before deciding which is right for you. \nCredit Cards\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYou can complete a credit card application in several ways: online, on a paper application, or on the phone. Applying for a credit card online is convenient and you can get a decision almost immediately. Be prepared with personal details like your date of birth and social security number; details on income and housing costs; and information on any authorized users you want to add to the account.\nCredit card approval can often be obtained instantly online but getting the plastic in your hands is another matter. If you are in a particular hurry many issuers can ship your card for overnight delivery, but at a significant cost. Otherwise it generally takes 3 - 10 business days to get your new credit card through the U.S. mail.\nCredit card issuers determine each cardholder’s credit limit based on many factors, the most important of which is the customer’s credit score. Other factors typically include employment status, income level and debt to income ratio. Whether credit limits are a set dollar amount or are dynamic, i.e. not pre-set, the creditworthiness of the borrower is the most important consideration for lenders in determining how much credit to extend.\nVery often it is quite possible to lower the interest rate on your credit card account if you contact your card issuer’s customer service department with the request. Your account must be in good standing to be eligible for an interest rate adjustment, however, which means you have not been late with previous payments or exceeded your credit limit.\nCredit card disputes typically arise when consumers unsuccessfully attempt to get a refund from a merchant for unwanted or defective merchandise or they notice an unauthorized charge on their credit card statement. In these cases the customer should contact their card issuer to dispute a charge either online or by calling the toll-free number on the back of their card.\nKey Terms\nCredit Card\nA credit card is a small plastic payment device connected to a revolving credit account issued by a financial services company or national bank that is accepted by network merchants for the purchase of goods and services. Credit cards typically feature an embossed account number, expiration date and cardmember name on the front of the card along with the payment network logo, security chip and card issuer name. The back of a credit card features a magnetic strip, holographic network logo and security number along with customer service numbers to contact in case of loss or theft.\nCredit Card Balance\nA credit card balance is the sum total of all the charges made during the current billing cycle in addition to any balances that were carried forward from previous billing periods. Credit card balances can not exceed the credit limit on the account. The ratio of credit card balances to the credit limit determines the level of utilization of the account, which is factored into the calculation of the individual’s credit score.\nCredit Card Debt\nCredit card debt is the unsecured liability that is incurred by a consumer when they carry balances forward past the due date. Revolving credit card debt is subject to minimum payments of approximately 3-5% of the total balance each month and is subject to the regular interest rate on the account unless promotional or penalty rates are in effect.\nMinimum Monthly Payment\nThe minimum monthly payment on a credit card account is the greater of either a stated percentage of outstanding balances (typically 3-5%, depending on the issuer) or a fixed dollar amount (typically $5 - $10). Cardholders must make at least the minimum payment due each month on their account in order to keep it in good standing. Balances that remain after making the minimum monthly payment are subject to interest rate charges.\nGrace Period (Credit)\nA credit card grace period is the amount of time in days between the statement closing date and the due date for the charges made in the current billing cycle. Interest is not assessed on balances accrued during the current billing cycle if payment is made in full on or before the due date. The interest-free grace period only applies to current balances if no previous balances were carried forward from the previous billing period.\nSchumer Box\nA Schumer box is a set of credit card terms and conditions disclosure in table form that are mandated to be displayed within credit card advertising material. The Schumer box displays such details as annual percentage rates for new credit card purchases, balance transfers, balance transfer fees, annual fees and other potential costs to consumers.\nExplore Credit Cards\nPersonal Finance",

  "text": "How We Will Improve the Diversity and Inclusiveness of Investopedia and Our Content\nUpdated: Dec 18, 2023 \nFinancial education needs to serve readers of all backgrounds. We aspire for our content, staff, contributors, and partner organizations to further the financial empowerment of those from all ethnicities, genders, generations, sexual orientations, abilities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly those who may be disadvantaged. Here are four things we are doing in an effort to improve how we deliver on that goal across the themes of content, people and community: \nContent. We continually seek to remove bias from our content in the service of being as objective and helpful as possible for our readers. \nSince 2020, our Anti-Bias Review Board, which is composed of more than 15 subject matter experts including educators, public health professionals, journalists, researchers, and financial experts, has reviewed every educational article in Investopedia’s library. \nThat review resulted in edits made to articles that were deemed to have biased language or information. Just as importantly, the review helped identify opportunities for making our content more inclusive to all audiences. We also created content to offer deeper examinations of subjects like housing discrimination and access to banks for all. With the review of our existing educational library complete, we pledge to review new educational articles on an ongoing basis before they are published. \nContent: Create Timeless, Inclusive Financial Content \nOver the last two years, we have reviewed and updated 14,000 articles on Investopedia to be inclusive. In 2023, we will work with the Dotdash Meredith Anti-Bias Review Board to review all new educational articles on an ongoing basis to ensure it is inclusive and free of bias. \nPeople. Producing unbiased content requires that the people creating it bring an array of experiences and diverse perspectives. \nIn 2024 we will continue our series of bimonthly information and training sessions led by Mackenzie Price, Ph.D., director for anti-bias initiatives at Dotdash Meredith, to educate our staff on the challenges and experiences that disadvantaged groups may have. In understanding those challenges and experiences, we can better create content that will serve their needs.\nCommunity. There are many organizations that exist to serve the needs of disadvantaged groups. We currently partner with four such organizations and use Investopedia’s reach and expertise to help them execute their mission. \nhttps://www.wallstreetbound.org/ - Wall Street Bound teaches the technical “hard” skills of finance and the “soft” skills of corporate culture to empower under-represented young adults to achieve beyond their present horizons. \nhttps://www.projectcomeup.org/ - Project Come Up is a nonprofit organization with a sole focus to foster growth among the disenfranchised. Their strategy is focused on providing educational platforms and investment opportunities for underrepresented minority communities. \nhttps://www.nefe.org/ - NEFE champions effective financial education. We are the independent, centralizing voice providing leadership, research and collaboration to advance financial well-being. \nhttps://www.jumpstart.org/ - Investopedia is a national partner of Jump$tart. Jump$tart supports the financial education efforts of its partners and affiliates, brings together the financial literacy community to foster cooperation and collaboration. Jump$tart raises the importance of financial literacy and the importance of effective financial education.\nInvestopedia\nThe work at Investopedia will evolve, and there is no progress without accountability. This is the continuation of a permanent and necessary shift in how we serve the financial community. We encourage our readers to share their thoughts and ideas for improvement by emailing us at inv_editorial@investopedia.com.",

  "text": "Financial Literacy Resource Center\nLesson Plans for Elementary School Educators \nInvestopedia is committed to extending our reach and resources to schools and underserved communities that have traditionally been left out of the conversation. That’s why we’ve created free content and materials to support today’s investing environment, found here in the Financial Literacy Resource Center and our new newsletter, The Classroom Investor. \nIn the table below, you’ll find downloadable lesson plans filled with guidance and worksheets that can be used to supplement classroom or at-home learning for children in grades K-5. There are eight lessons per grade, and each lesson plan builds on the preceding one. The subject matter also gets more detailed as students get older. (Simply right-click on each lesson to be taken to a new tab, and then you can download the content from there.) \nKeep scrolling, and you'll find teen-focused content, too. While this is only the beginning, these resources will help anyone become an engaged and educated participant in the ever-evolving financial markets. \nThe content within the lesson plans above was crafted using guidance from educators within public schools and nonprofits in the U.S., and Kara Cordell of Oklahoma City Public Schools served as an invaluable resource in content creation. The Investopedia team piloted the content at Timber Lakes Elementary School in Orlando, Florida. \nFinancial Education for Teens\nFinancial Education for Kids\nFrequently Asked Questions\nFinancial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various skills and concepts, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. A strong foundation of financial literacy—especially one that starts at an early age—can help support various life goals, such as saving for education or retirement, using debt responsibly, and running a business.\nThis section of Investopedia is a free, digital library for educators, teachers, and parents looking for materials to help them teach the next generation of investors. Linked in the table on this page are downloadable lesson plans, worksheets, and guidance that can be used to supplement classroom or at-home learning for children in grades K-5. Investopedia has also curated a collection of articles to help set teens (grades 9-12) up for success as they start working and/or pursue higher education.\nThe K-5 lessons plans available to download from this library cover the fundamentals of personal finance and investing, as appropriate for each age level. These lesson plans have been reviewed by licensed educators, and used by Timberlakes Elementary School in Orlando, Florida. The articles in this library for parents and teachers of teens (grades 9-12) focus primarily on building and using credit, investing, digital money management (e.g. using Venmo or Apple Pay), and real-world applications of personal finance topics.\nYes! Investopedia is committed to making financial literacy accessible for everyone. As more lesson plans and articles become available, we will update this resource page. Follow us on social media @investopedia, and bookmark this webpage to stay looped into the latest.\nIn addition to our content library, the Investopedia Stock Simulator is an instructional tool for students (or yourself) to practice trading and investing in stocks in a safe, simulated environment. We also have a monthly newsletter for educators, “The Classroom Investor,” to give context to financial news, new product developments, and share additional free teaching resources.\nKey Terms\nFinancial Literacy\nFinancial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. When an individual is financially literate, you have the foundation of a relationship with money, and it is a lifelong journey of learning.\nCredit Score\nA credit score is a number from 300 to 850 that rates a consumer or individual’s creditworthiness. It is based on credit history: number of open accounts, total levels of debt, repayment history, and other factors. The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders, because lenders use credit scores to evaluate the probability that an individual will repay loans in a timely manner.\nInterest\nInterest is the monetary charge for borrowing money—generally expressed as a percentage, such as an annual percentage rate (APR). Interest is the amount of money a lender or financial institution receives for lending out money. And interest can also refer to the amount of ownership a stockholder has in a company, usually expressed as a percentage.\nCryptocurrency\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. The most commonly known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. Generally, as of March 2022, cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\nDiversification\nDiversification is a risk management strategy where one chooses a variety of investments for their portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types, such as stocks and bonds, in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The idea is that different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\nAsset Class\nAn asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations. Historically, the three main asset classes have been equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), and cash equivalent or money market instruments.\nImport\nAn import is a good or service that was produced in one country, and bought in another one. Imports, along with exports, are one of the key components of international trade. If the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports, the country has a negative balance of trade, also known as a trade deficit.\nSecurity\nThe term \"security\" in finance refers to a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. Securities are used to raise capital in public and private markets. The primary types of securities are equity—which provides ownership rights to holders—debt, and hybrids, which combine aspects of debt and equity.\nMobile Wallet\nA mobile wallet stores credit card or debit card information on a mobile device like your phone, a tablet, or smartwatch. With a mobile wallet, one can buy things online or in stores more easily. They may also be more secure than physical payment cards because of the technology they use to protect your account information.\nCompound Interest\nSimply put, compound interest is the interest you earn on interest. It is calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Compounding multiplies money at an accelerated rate and the greater the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest will be.\nConsumer Debt\nConsumer debt includes personal debts that are owed as a result of purchasing goods that are used for individual or household consumption. Examples of consumer debt include credit card debt, student loans, auto loans, mortgages, and payday loans. These can be extended by a bank, the federal government, and credit unions.\nFintech\nFintech, or financial technology, is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and simplify the delivery and use of financial services. Fintech is utilized by companies, business owners, and consumers, in an effort to better manage financial operations, processes, and lives. Examples of fintech applications include robo-advisors, payment apps, and investment apps, among others.\nNet Worth\nNet worth is the value of the assets a person or corporation owns, minus the liabilities they owe. It is an important metric to gauge a company's health, providing a useful snapshot of its current financial position. Net worth has also become popular in everyday culture, with lists ranking the people with the highest net worth as well as the net worth of various celebrities.",

  "text": "Retirement Planning: Strategies, Tools, Choices\nYour Guide to Retirement Planning\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIf you haven’t been tracking all this already, this is the time to calculate how much money you will need and how much income you can expect to have. Do the math, figure out whether you’re on track, and decide what to do next–everything from changing needs or retirement income to working a few more years. \nStart by understanding your investment options–both the different types of retirement accounts and the various investment categories. Then start saving early, track your net worth, keep your cool, and watch out for fees that sap your gains. And unless you’re really good at this, don’t go it alone.\nRetirement isn’t just one step called “stop working at a job.” After the pre-retirement stage and the big good-bye, expect to move through a honeymoon phase, disenchantment, the job of building a new identity, and finally settling into a routine. \nIf you’re thinking of relocating after you retire, here are the best places in both the U.S. and abroad, according to retirement researchers. Be sure to make extended visits to any new location you’re considering before making the move, especially if it involves living in another culture where people speak a different language. \nOne rule is that people generally need 80% of their current income in retirement. Will you have that much? Start by estimating your future expenses, looking at how much you’ll get from Social Security, and reviewing your retirement savings accounts and any pensions, plus other savings you may have. \nNot thinking ahead can decimate your retirement. Among the bad steps: quitting your job before checking on your retirement-plan vesting status, not saving or planning, not maxing out employer matching funds, investment mistakes, poor tax planning and taking Social Security early. \nKey Terms\nRequired Minimum Distribution\nThis is an amount that people age 72 or over (the age requirement may rise to 75) must take from many tax-advantaged retirement accounts, including traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, Roth 401(k)s, and 403(b) accounts.The required amount is based on an IRS formula and the penalties for not taking RMDs are stiff.\nRetirement Planning\nThe retirement-planning process sets retirement income goals and builds out the steps required to get there. These include determining income sources and expected expenses, creating a savings plan utilizing the best retirement account choices for you, and choosing investments. Prepare to adjust your plan to fit changing circumstances.\n4% Rule\nThis rule recommends that, in order to ensure a safe, steady steam of income, retirees withdraw no more than 4% of their savings every year. Based on historical data, this rule is designed to ensure that savings last throughout retirement. Some experts think the rule could rise to 5% and others that 3% is more prudent with current interest rates.\nFinancial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE)\nProponents of this movement, based on a best-seller originally published in 1992, save aggressively in order to retire well before age 65. This can involve stashing up to 70% of income until savings reach around 30 times expenses. Then the saver can retire, continuing to live on a very tight budget but without the constrictions of daily work. \nSubstantially Equal Periodic Payment (SEPP)\nSEPP is a way to receive funds from an IRA or other qualified retirement plan before age 59½. It lets the recipient avoid incurring IRS withdrawal penalties of 10% of the distributed amount. The process involves specified annual distributions for a period of five years or until the account-holder turns 59½, whichever comes later. Income tax is still due on withdrawals.\nHardship Withdrawal\nPeople who withdraw from tax-advantaged retirement plans before age 59½ are usually subject to withdrawal penalties. However, emergency withdrawals in response to “an immediate and heavy financial need,” as the IRS terms it, may be allowed under certain circumstances. For 401(k)s, the employer’s rules determine which situations are permitted.\nExplore Retirement Planning\nPersonal Finance",

This type of economy is often associated with communist nations. The advantages of this approach include better equality and lower unemployment, but there is often a lack of efficiency or innovation in those economies.\nA market economy, or free economy, is directed through the laws of supply and demand to set the prices and quantities for most goods and services. Most developed nations are technically mixed economies because they blend free markets with some government interference such as industrial subsidies, licensing, and price fixing.\nInflation means the rate at which the same goods and services come to cost more. If a person's income doesn't keep up with inflation, it can decrease your purchasing power. It can also lower the value of Treasury bonds. But if some level of inflation is expected, it can drive consumer spending, which drives economic growth.\nWhen the price of a large number of stocks is on the rise, it can lead to higher consumer and business confidence, higher spending on big-ticket items such as cars and houses, and an increase in investors entering the stock market. These factors can all lead to greater economic development of a country.\nThe United States has a mixed economy. It combines elements of a command economy with a market economy. A mixed economy allows for government oversight and regulation to achieve public good while also allowing things like consumer goods and services to be regulated by the laws of supply and demand.\nKey Terms\nEconomy\nAn economy encompasses all activity related to the production, consumption, trade, and distribution of available goods and services. The management of those resources is used to satisfy the needs of the people, businesses, organizations, and governments in a specific area.\nMoney\nCurrency, or money, is a generally accepted, recognized, and centralized medium of exchange that market participants use to engage in transactions for goods and services in an economy. Each government has its own money system that is monitored by a central authority.\nTrade\nThe buying, selling, or bartering of goods and services is known as trade. In an economy, a trade takes place between a producer and a consumer, usually in exchange for money. An exchange of goods and services between two countries is international trade.\nKnowledge Economy\nA knowledge economy is a system of consumption and production based on the intangible assets of intellectual capital. It refers to the ability to capitalize on scientific discoveries and academic research, and has come to represent a large component of all economic activity in developed countries.\nWealth\nWealthy is an abundant supply of valuable economic assets or resources owned by a person, company, community, or nation. It can be determined by subtracting debt from the total market value of all physical and intangible assets.\nLaw of Supply and Demand\nThe law of supply and demand is an economic theory based on two separate \"laws\" that explain the interaction between the sellers of a resource and the buyers of that resource. The theory defines the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. Generally, as the price increases, people are willing to supply more and demand less and vice versa when the price falls.\nInflation\nA decline of the purchasing power of a specific currency over time is known as inflation. You can see the rate of decline reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy over a specified period of time. The rise in the general level of prices, often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.\nOrganized Labor\nAn association of workers united as a single entity, known as organized labor or a union, seek to improve the economic status and working conditions of employees through collective bargaining with management.\nSluggish Economy\nThe colloquial phrase \"sluggish economy\" is not an exact and quantifiable thing. It is derived from an analogy to a slug and refers to an economy in which growth is slow in macroeconomic terms. It can be used to describe an entire economy or a segment of it.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of a country's overall domestic production and a measure of that country's overall economic health. It is calculated by the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period.\nExplore Economy\nWhat is a Fed Pivot and Why Does It Matter?\nDoom Loop: Definition, Causes, and Examples\nFed’s Preferred Inflation Gauge Rose More Than Expected in August 2022\nThe U.S. Labor Market Recovery in Charts\nBy\nCaleb Silver and Adrian Nesta\nUpdated Sep 02, 2022 \nWhat Basel IV Means for U.S. Banks \nTop 32 Developed and Developing Countries\nUnderstanding Money: Its Properties, Types, and Uses\nWhat Is the Unemployment Rate?\nMarket Economy vs. Command Economy: What's the Difference?\nIs the United States a Market Economy or a Mixed Economy?\nWhat Is the Knowledge Economy?

The vast majority of Berkshire’s cash ($288 billion) is invested in short-term Treasury bills.34 \nInvestors watch the firm's cash hoard closely for its potential as “dry powder,” money that can be invested in businesses that meet Berkshire’s value-focused acquisition and investment strategy. \nBerkshire paused share repurchases in the quarter. Buffett has touted the benefits of repurchases in the past, writing in his 2022 letter to shareholders: “Gains from value-accretive repurchases, it should be emphasized, benefit all owners – in every respect.”5 But Buffett is famously thrifty, and the price of Berkshire shares surged to a record high in the quarter. \nBuffett Sells Apple, Bank of America Stocks \nThe value of Berkshire’s equity portfolio declined to $271.7 billion from $284.9 billion in the prior quarter. Berkshire has aggressively trimmed its equity positions this year to take profits from a buoyant stock market. The firm has sold $133 billion of stock so far this year, compared with just $33 billion in the first nine months of 2023. \nThe value of Berkshire’s Apple stock suggests Buffett continued to trim his stake in the iPhone maker. Apple shares rose more than 10% in the third quarter. Yet Berkshire’s stake shrank from $84.2 billion to $69.9 billion, suggesting Buffett sold about a quarter of his position.3 Buffett had already dumped nearly half of his Apple stock, worth nearly $175 billion at the end of 2023, in the first six months of the year. \nThe only other major change Buffett made to Berkshire’s five largest equity positions was his well-documented offloading of Bank of America stock. Berkshire began trimming its stake in the lender in mid-July. At the end of the quarter, Berkshire’s stake stood at $31.7 billion, down from $41.1 billion at the end of June. \nHurricanes Hit Insurance Earnings \nInvestment income at Berkshire’s insurance businesses rose 50% to almost $3.7 billion in the quarter. Those gains were more than offset by a 70% slump in insurance underwriting profit, which totaled $750 million. \nBerkshire estimates that losses from Hurricane Helene wiped away $565 million in operating profit during the quarter. The company estimated that losses from Hurricane Milton, which struck Florida in early October, could fall between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. Those losses will be reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter results. \nProfit at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which it recently made a wholly-owned subsidiary, tripled to $1.6 billion, boosted by higher earnings from natural gas pipelines and lower litigation costs. \nEarnings at Berkshire’s railroad business increased by 13%, benefiting from higher volumes and lower operating costs.\nJoin eToro — offering crypto trading since 2013\nTrade the world’s leading cryptoassets on a platform trusted by millions of traders worldwide. \nDon’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Take 2 mins to learn more",

  "text": "Banking: Maximizing Today's Banking Options\nAll About Banking\nFrequently Asked Questions\nBanks are a very important part of the economy because they provide vital services for both consumers and businesses. Banks provide a secure way to store, protect and provide access to customer deposits. Consumers can conduct routine banking transactions through checking accounts, ATMs and electronic transfers while earning interest on their deposits held in deposit accounts like savings, certificates of deposits and in certain demand deposit accounts.\nThe federal government began offering insurance on bank deposits in March 1933 through the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) after more than 9,000 banks failed as a result of the great depression. The FDIC is an independent agency that was created to boost confidence in the health and well-being of the national financial system and currently offers $250,000 of coverage per customer, per account.\nLarger banks can provide relatively more financial stability compared to smaller financial institutions like state and community banks and other financial institutions. While the U.S. banking system is very strong, including at the state and community level, larger banks are usually nationally chartered commercial banks that are guaranteed to provide FDIC insurance on deposits and are less likely to default on their obligations due to federally mandated capital reserve requirements.\nA national bank is a commercial bank that is chartered by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and functions as a member bank of the Federal Reserve, as well as being an investing member of its district Federal Reserve Bank. National banks are required to be members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and provide deposit insurance coverage to their customers.\nBank fees are charges levied by banks and other financial institutions on their personal and business customers for things like account set-up, maintenance, and transactional services. Other examples of bank fees are wire transfer fees, automated teller machine (ATM) fees, non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees, and late payment charges.\nKey Terms\nDeposit\nA deposit with a bank refers to money held by the financial institution in a customer account. Deposits are held by banks for safekeeping and typically earn interest depending on the type of account.\nChecking Account\nA checking account is a type of bank account held at a financial institution that permits withdrawals and deposits on a daily transactional basis. Checking accounts are also known as demand deposit accounts because they are highly liquid and can be accessed by writing checks, withdrawing or depositing funds with automated teller machines, and by debit card transactions.\nPersonal Loan\nA personal loan is the process of borrowing a sum of money for personal use and is generally unsecured by collateral. Personal loans are typically used to pay off credit card debt, purchase big ticket items or fund large expenses like vacations or weddings. Personal loans can be offered by banks, credit unions, or online lenders and involve a set repayment term and either fixed or variable interest along with possible loan fees.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts to protect customers from bank failures. The FDIC was created during the great depression to maintain public confidence and provide stability to the financial system through the promotion of sound banking practices. The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor for customers of member banks.\nBank Statement\nA bank statement is a document sent from a financial institution to an account holder, either by mail or delivered electronically, that details monthly account activity, showing the account number and all the transactions in sequential order processed during the previous account cycle.\nUnderbanked\nUnderbanked refers to people or segments of society who may have an account with a financial institution but choose to rely on very expensive non-bank sources of financial services such as wire-transfer or check-cashing services, title loans and payday loans instead of more traditional sources of retail banking services like debit and credit cards, demand deposit accounts and personal loans to meet their daily financial needs. This may be due to lack of access due to lower credit scores, not having banks near their residences, limited financial literacy or distrust of traditional financial services.\nExplore Banking\nCash Management Account vs. Brokerage Account\nHow to Join a Credit Union\nWhat Happened to First Republic Bank?\nWhat Is a Regional Bank?

  "text": "All About Choosing and Maintaining\nSavings Accounts\nFrequently Asked Questions\nA savings account is considered high-yield if it pays more than a financial institution’s regular demand deposit or passbook savings accounts. High yield savings accounts are typically money market savings accounts that are limited to six withdrawal transactions per month.\nInterest earned on savings accounts is reported to the IRS by commercial banks and other financial institutions and therefore is subject to federal income tax as regular income. Interest is reported on Form 1099 to bank customers, typically in January each year for the previous tax year.\nBoth savings accounts and Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars by individual investors. However, unlike savings accounts, any capital appreciation earned with a Roth IRA is not subject to federal income tax. Growth in savings accounts, in the form of interest, is subject to taxation.\nSimple interest for a savings account is calculated by multiplying the account balance by the stated interest rate and then multiplying by the time period the money is in the account. Interest = Principal amount X Interest Rate X Time Period.\nA savings account is different from a checking account in that it is meant for accumulation of funds and earning interest rather than being a transaction account accessible with checks and debit cards. Savings accounts can be freely accessed by the account holder through deposits and withdrawals on demand and generally pay higher interest than checking accounts but are not designed for payment transactions.\nKey Terms\nSavings Account\nA savings account is a deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution that pays interest on the balance held in the account. Interest rates are typically modest but these accounts provide safety for emergency funds and savings needed for long-term needs.\nDeposit Interest Rate\nThe deposit interest rate is the rate paid by banks and other financial institutions to deposit account customers in exchange for the use of their deposits to make loans. Deposit accounts include passbook savings, high-yield savings accounts, and certificates of deposit accounts.\nSweep Account\nA sweep account is a specialized account that is often attached to a brokerage account to automatically transfer or sweep cash funds into a low-risk, higher interest-earning investment such as a money market fund at the close of each business day.\nPassbook Loan\nA passbook loan is a loan made to a savings account owner or depositor by the bank holding the funds. The savings account balances serve as collateral for the personal loan, which is also called a pledged asset loan.\nLinked Savings Account\nA linked savings account is a deposit account connected to another account such as a checking or brokerage account.

  "text": "Government & Policy: Economic Impact\nGovernment and the Economy\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe most common way governments control inflation is by raising or lowering interest rates. Put simply, high interest rates counter inflation by reducing the money supply, and low interest rates promote inflation by increasing the money supply. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve indirectly controls interest rates through the federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for loans made overnight.\nCommunism and socialism both advocate for a more equitable distribution of wealth than that achieved under capitalism, but they differ in their means and the extremity of their vision. A basic premise of communism is that a communist order is achieved through a revolution in which the working class (proletariat) overthrows the ruling class (bourgeoisie). Socialism insists on working within existing systems to implement reform. Communism also advocates the dissolution of all private property so that all property is owned by the state, which distributes resources evenly between citizens. Under socialism, the means of accumulating wealth (industry and commerce) are collectively-owned and managed by the government, but property like homes and personal possessions can remain privately-owned.\nAccording to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, U.S. healthcare spending is expected to reach $6.2 trillion, or 20% of GDP, by 2028. In 2020, spending per person was $12,530, the highest of any developed country. Norway, which ranked second in terms of healthcare costs, spent $6,748 per person, almost half of U.S. expenditures.\nMonetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to achieve economic goals like low unemployment and stable prices. Monetary policy is often executed through the increase or decrease of the money supply. Fiscal policy refers to the government’s tax and spending plans. Fiscal policy is administered by the legislative and executive branches of government.\nKey Terms\nDiscount Window\nThe discount window is a Federal Reserve lending facility that makes short-term, collateralized loans to financial institutions. These loans are made to banks when they are experiencing liquidity shortfalls. The fed offers these loans at the discount rate, a fixed interest rate that the Federal Reserve usually sets slightly above the federal funds rate—the rate that applies to short-term loans between banks—to incentivize banks to borrow from each other rather than the central bank.\nCorporate Tax\nCorporate taxes are, like an individual’s income taxes, a portion of a company’s profit levied by a government to finance public services. Though there is a set corporate tax rate in the U.S., companies often pay a much lower effective tax rate by exploiting loopholes, a subject of near-constant controversy.\nGovernment-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE)\nA government-sponsored enterprise is a privately-run company that was established by the U.S. Congress to improve the flow of credit to certain sectors of the U.S. economy. The best-known GSEs are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which essentially buy whole mortgage loans from lenders to sell to investors in smaller chunks. Though GSEs are not controlled by the government and their bonds are not backed by the U.S. Treasury, they enjoy the benefits of an “implicit guarantee” that the government won’t stand by while they fail or default on their debt.\nFederal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)\nThe Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is a U.S. law, passed in 1935 alongside the Social Security Act, that mandates a payroll tax to fund Social Security and Medicare. FICA taxes are levied at a rate set by the federal government every year, and are paid by both the employee and the employer. Self-employed individuals, since they do not have an employer, are subject to a similar law called the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA).\nTariff\nTariffs are a tax imposed by a government on foreign goods when they enter the territory under that government’s control. Tariffs can be specific or ad valorem. Specific tariffs are levies of a specific amount of money per item or unit (e.g., $1 per pound of apples.) Ad valorem tariffs are levies of a percentage of the value of the import (e.g., 10% of a shipment of cars valued at $10 million.) Governments usually impose tariffs to support domestic producers by making their goods competitive with or more attractive than imported goods.\nNational Debt\nThe national debt is the amount of money a federal government owes creditors. National debt is accumulated when a government sells debt securities—Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, in the case of the U.S.—worth more than the revenue it brings in through, for example, taxes. Creditors can include individual investors, financial institutions, corporations, and even other countries’ governments.\nAntitrust Laws\nAntitrust laws are regulations intended to ensure competition between companies within a market economy. Antitrust laws allow regulatory authorities to break up monopolies and block mergers and acquisitions that would over-concentrate market power. They also aim to prevent corporations from colluding with one another or forming cartels to fix prices and stymie challengers.\nTrumponomics: Definition, Key Principles, and Impact\nU.S. Unemployment Rate by President\nU.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth by President\nU.S. Inflation Rate by President: From Eisenhower to Biden\nU.S. Government Uses for Artificial Intelligence\nGolden Visa Countries: Everything You Need to Know\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nPublished Jan 05, 2024 \nBidenomics: How Joe Biden’s Policies Are Shaping the U.S. Economy\n14th Amendment and Its Role in the Debt Ceiling Debate\nThe Gilded Age Explained: An Era of Wealth and Inequality\nU.S. National Debt by Year\nSupreme Court 2023 Rulings on Affirmative Action Explained\nU.S. Debt by President: Dollar and Percentage\nRulemaking for Federal Agencies\nDigital Markets Act (DMA): How the EU Law Will Work\nWhat ‘Slowcession’ Means for Economic Growth\nPregnant Workers Fairness Act: Protections, Legal Remedies, Examples\nFederal Pandemic Unemployment Programs: How They Worked\nNational Defense Authorization Act for FY 2023\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB): Definition, Duties, and Activities\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB)\nEmployee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS): What It Is, How to Use It\nAmerican Rescue Plan (Biden’s $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Package) \nBank Term Funding Program: Definition, Why It Was Created\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): How It Works, What It Provides\n5 Reasons Why Supply-Side Economics Does Not Work\nU.S. Export Restrictions: What Are They, and How Do They Work?\nSectoral Bargaining: What It Is, How It Works, Pro and Con Debate\nLargest Indigenous Groups in the U.S.\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated May 28, 2024 \nWhat Is the Rural Energy for America Program?\nFinancial Help for Climate-Friendly Farmers, Ranchers\nWhat Is the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022?\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nWhat Is a Specific Performance Clause?\nFirsts for American LGBTQ+ People\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated May 30, 2024 \n1973 Energy Crisis: Causes and Effects\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO): Meaning and Members\nU.S. Trade Representative (USTR)\nHousing Trust Fund (HTF)\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated Sep 13, 2024 \nWho Was Margaret Thatcher?\nOligarch: What It is, How it Works, FAQs\nCommunity Development Block Grants (CDBG) Overview\nJuneteenth: What It Is, History, Other Freedom Days\nFTC Takes On Pandemic Predators\nEmancipation Day: Meaning, History, Versus Juneteenth\nEqual Pay Act of 1963: Overview, Benefits, and Criticisms\nLifeline Program for Low-Income Consumers\nSocial Insurance: What it is, How it Works\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: Definition and Summary\nBank Merger Review Modernization Act Definition\nTechnology Modernization Fund (TMF)\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated Nov 22, 2022 \nBiden's Proposals to Fight Emergencies and Climate Change\nCommunity Land Trust: Meaning, Pros and Cons, Example\nSection 230 Protection: Meaning, Criticism, Purpose\nWho Was Alexander Hamilton?\nNo Surprises Act Definition, Improved Healthcare Transparency\nPaycheck Fairness Act: Meaning, Pros and Cons\nRent Stabilization: What it is, How it Works, Examples\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated Nov 30, 2022 \nEconomy",

  "text": "The Quest To Make Your Chipotle Bowl Fast and Fresh is Going High-Tech. Here's Why.\nKey Takeaways\nChipotle is investing in back-of-the-house technology to maintain consistency across restaurants and lift efficiency.\nAll restaurants will get produce slicers and busy locations may get more efficient grills. The company is experimenting with machines that prepare avocados and assemble burrito bowls and salads.\nThe move to streamline restaurants is seen across the industry, from burger chains to salad makers.\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has spent years linking its brand with “classic” culinary techniques. Now it’s folding in state-of-the-art slicers, mechanized avocado peelers and automated dish assembly.\nThe burrito chain is looking to build up capacity with high-tech appliances and automation, Interim CEO Scott Boatwright said this week. Produce slicers that chop onions, jalapeños and fajita vegetables will be in all of its restaurants by the end of next summer, Boatwright said. And about 75 high-volume restaurants are getting grills that can cook meat twice as fast; they cook the top and bottom of the meat simultaneously, a spokesperson said.\nThe company is also testing a new tool for cooking chips, a robot that peels and slices avocados and a machine that assembles burrito bowls and salads, Boatwright said.\n“I envision significant back-of-the-house changes in the near future that will drive efficiencies and improve the consistency of our culinary in our restaurants,” Boatwright said, according to a transcript of the call made available by AlphaSense.1 \nThe push to improve throughput comes as Chipotle saw comparable-store growth of 6% last quarter. Traffic has been sluggish industry-wide, but Chipotle performed worse than analysts expected. \nOther chains are making similar moves. Sweetgreen (SG) is deploying Infinite Kitchen, which automates many parts of salad and bowl assembly, CFO Mitch Reback said this spring.2 Jack in the Box (JACK) extended a trial of automated fry production to a second restaurant in the third quarter.3 And Starbucks (SBUX), now led by a former Chipotle CEO, is installing tools that require less staff involvement in grinding coffee beans, as well as a system that reduces the need for bending and heavy lifting when blending beverages.\nDiners care less about how meals come together than they do about their cost and speed, said Jason Kaplan, CEO of JK Consulting, a restaurant advisory firm in New York City. While a focus on fresh prep fueled Chipotle’s success, its customers will likely embrace the technology, Kaplan said.\n“People expect a certain speed,” Kaplan said. “The consumer of today is even less patient than the consumer of 10, 15 years ago.”\nBoatwright, who was named Chipotle's interim CEO in August, said the new technology would help keep vegetables a uniform size and maintain consistency across restaurants. Asked if automation could deter consumers drawn to Chipotle’s \"classic\" techniques, a company spokesperson said the chain still uses fresh ingredients and true cooking methods. The innovations make the process more efficient and enhance the flavor profile, the spokesperson said.\nAnd on Tuesday’s call, Boatwright said that some ideas the company had considered — such as a central prep kitchen that serves multiple restaurants — have so far been challenging from expense and food safety perspectives.\nThe innovations introduced so far may largely go unnoticed by consumers, said Dean Small, founder and managing partner of Synergy Restaurant Consultants, an advisory firm based in California.\n“These things are behind the scenes,\" Small said, who doesn’t anticipate that they’ll “deter from the guest experience.” \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Monetary Policy\nIntro to Monetary Policy\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMonetary policy is how central banks influence the economy by raising or lowering the money supply. This is in contrast to fiscal policy, which is how the government uses its taxes and spending to affect the economy.\nMonetary policy has a few main tools—reserve requirements, discount rates, open market operations (OMO), and quantitative easing (QE).\nMonetary policy affects markets in many ways, however, two main ones include boosting or dampening the economy as a whole, and raising or lowering bond yields. First, as expansionary monetary policy can boost the economy as a whole, investments more sensitive to the business cycle will usually benefit and vice versa with contractionary policy. Secondly, monetary policy’s effect on interest rates causes yields to rise and fall, which changes the relative value of existing interest-bearing investments.\nExpansionary monetary policy is when a central bank increases the money supply which fights recessions and increases economic growth. Contractionary economic policy pulls money out of the economy in order to fight inflation.\nKey Terms\nTapering\nTapering is the process of gradually decreasing the size of an expansionary monetary policy. This can include any form of monetary policy but is most often applied to quantitative easing (QE).\nForeign Exchange Reserves\nForeign exchange reserves, also called Forex reserves, are stores of foreign currencies held by central banks. The central banks use these to purchase their own currency to carry out monetary policy.\nM2\nM2 is one way to measure the money supply. It includes all cash and checking deposits, referred to as M1, as well as savings deposits, money market securities, and certificates of deposit (CD).\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)\nThe IMF is a multinational organization meant to promote economic growth, ensure the stability of the world financial system, and lower poverty. It offers grants, loans, and other financial assistance to countries to accomplish these goals.\nLiquidity Trap\nA liquidity trap is when cash savings rates are high and interest rates are low. This combination makes it difficult for monetary policy to affect the economy.\nEconomic Stimulus\nEconomic stimulus refers to policies undertaken by a government or central bank to increase economic growth and counter recession. These can be either fiscal or monetary in nature.\nCurrency\nA currency is anything that serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Most countries have a standard currency to serve these functions in that country.\nTrilemma\nThe monetary policy trilemma is the inability to simultaneously have a fixed currency exchange rate, allow capital to flow in and out of a country freely, and maintain an autonomous monetary policy. A country can only have two of the above and the decision as to which two is a critical part of monetary policy.\nExplore Monetary Policy\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility: Overview\nShould We Become a Cashless Society?\nWhat Are the Top U.S. Imports?\nThe Taylor Rule: An Economic Model for Monetary Policy\nWhat Is the International Monetary Fund (IMF)?\nM2 Definition and Meaning in the Money Supply\nDemonetization: Meaning, Example, and How It Works\nImport Substitution Industrialization (ISI): Definition and Example\nWhat Is a Fixed Exchange Rate?

  "text": "Certificates of Deposit (CDs)\nBest CD Rates\nGuide to CDs\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCDs, along with other types of deposit products, do not build credit. Only borrowing money through some type of loan from a financial services lender that reports to credit bureaus, like with a car loan, personal loan or credit card, can build a credit history.\nYes, CDs are different from U.S. savings bonds in that CDs are a deposit account that have a fixed term held with commercial banks and U.S. savings bonds are debt obligations of the United States federal government. U.S. savings bonds also offer fixed terms that pay interest at maturity but provide longer term options compared to traditional CDs.\nInvestable funds can be deposited in certificate of deposit instruments of various terms with commercial banks, where they will earn fixed or variable interest that is payable at maturity.\nCertificates of deposit typically pay higher interest than money market savings accounts due to the fact that they are less liquid and involve a penalty for early withdrawal. Money market savings accounts allow for limited withdrawals but do not have a maturity date or early withdrawal penalty involved. The better option depends on whether yield maximization or flexibility is more important to your financial needs.\nKey Terms\nFixed-Rate Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nA fixed rate certificate of deposit is a CD that has a set or fixed interest rate that is paid over the entire term of the instrument. The total fixed interest earned along with the CD principal is paid to the investor once the certificate of deposit reaches maturity.\nVariable-Rate Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nVariable rate CDs are deposit instruments that have a fixed term but pay a variable rate of interest over the term of the instrument that can be based on an index like the prime rate. Upon maturity the principal and variable interest earned are paid to the depositor.\nJumbo Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nA jumbo certificate of deposit is a CD that has a larger minimum deposit, which is $100,000, compared to regular CDs. Traditional certificates of deposit typically have a minimum deposit of $2,500. As with traditional certificates of deposit, interest earned is paid at maturity along with return of the principal.\nAdd-On CDs\nAn add-on CD is a type of certificate deposit that allows for additional deposits to be made before maturity of the instrument. Most CDs do not allow additional deposits to be made, however, and require a lump sum deposit at the beginning of the CD term. Add-on CDs typically pay lower interest compared to traditional CDs in exchange for the flexibility that they offer.\nCD Ladder\nA CD ladder is when a depositor spreads their deposits over number of certificates of deposit across multiple maturity periods, with each successively longer maturity term representing the ascending rungs of a ladder. Using this approach reduces the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations over time by allowing the depositor to continually roll over shorter term CDs and reinvest longer term CDs as they reach maturity in order to optimize yield.\nUninsured Certificate of Deposit\nUninsured certificates of deposit are CDs that are not covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). These types of CDs pay higher interest rates to investors due to the higher risk they present. Uninsured CDs are offered by investment firms and foreign banks that are not eligible for insurance coverage.\nBrokered Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nBrokered CDs are offered to investors through investment firms and are technically not insured by the FDIC. However, the savings held by the investment firm with a commercial bank, from which the brokered CDs are created, are insured, which offers investors a degree of protection. Brokered CDs offer investors more flexibility and higher yields vs. traditional certificates of deposit but also present higher risk.\nLiquid Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nA liquid certificate of deposit is a type of CD that allows the investor to make withdrawals before the CD reaches maturity without incurring an early withdrawal penalty. Traditional certificates of deposit do impose early withdrawal penalties so liquid CDs offer much more flexibility, although they pay less interest in exchange for that flexibility.\nBanking",

  "text": "Fiscal Policy\nFiscal Policy Essentials\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThere is nothing inherent preventing state and local governments from running deficits in the same way that national governments do. However, almost all U.S. State constitutions have balanced budget amendments, which legally prevent those specific states from doing so.\nContractionary fiscal policy can decrease the crowding-out effect by increasing the amount of credit available to other borrowers because less lending is going to the government to finance its debt.\nNo, States cannot declare bankruptcy as it is not permitted by U.S. bankruptcy law. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1977 that Article 1, Section 10 of the U.S. forbids them from doing so.\nDeficits are a critical tool in fiscal policy, allowing extra spending over and above what the government collects in taxes. This allows governments to finance important initiatives such as infrastructure improvement, economic stimulus during economic downturns, and national defense in wartime.\nKey Terms\nFiscal Policy\nFiscal policy refers to how governments collect and spend money. Fiscal policy is critical to how the government affects the economy at large.\nSubsidy\nA subsidy is money given to an individual or organization by the government. Government subsidies are often given to businesses to try to bolster sectors of the economy considered especially important.\nFinancial System\nA financial system is a network of organizations that enable financial transactions. Financial systems are made up of, among other institutions, banks, insurance companies, and stock brokerages. While there is a global financial system, there are also many national and regional financial systems that interact with and overlap with each other and the world financial system.\nSmoot-Hawley Tariff Act\nThe Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the colloquial name for the United States Tariff Act of 1930, raised U.S. tariffs on many goods by 20%. This tariff, passed after the onset of the Great Depression, provoked retaliatory tariffs from many other countries. This trade war likely resulted in economic damage, but the amount is disputed.\nImplementation Lag\nImplementation lag refers to the length of time between when an economic event, like a recession, begins, and when government interventions to deal with it are put in place. As such, governments need to try and take this lag into account or their interventions may be tailored to situations that are now passed.\nWorks Progress Administration (WPA)\nThe works progress administration was a fiscal stimulus program created in 1935 as part of the New Deal to combat the Great Depression. It sought to lower the unemployment rate by directly hiring people to do various kinds of work, such as building infrastructure projects.\nExplore Fiscal Policy\nThe 5 Poorest U.S. Presidents\nSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs): Definition and Requirements\nWhat Is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act?

  "text": "Chipotle's Latest Experiment Is an Avocado-Peeling Robot\nKey Takeaways\nChipotle said Monday that it is testing two new automation projects in a pair of California restaurants.\nOne is focused on speeding up guacamole prep by automatically slicing and peeling avocados. The other builds bowls and salads while employees make burritos and quesadillas.\nThe company said it has worked to identify \"time consuming and less favorable\" tasks that could be taken out of employee hands to speed up orders.\nYour next Chipotle (CMG) order could be made by robot hands. \nThe chain on Monday said it is testing robots at a pair of California locations. One is intended to speed up the guacamole-making process, while the second could make prepping customers' orders more efficient, the company said. \nThe \"cobotics,\" or collaborative robotics, are being tested for employee and customer feedback before the company determines how to proceed with a wider pilot, according to Chipotle's Chief Customer and Technology Officer Curt Garner.1 \nChipotle Looks to Speed Up Prep Process \nOne machine, the \"autocado,\" automatically cuts and skins an avocado in less than half a minute. The company said its goal with creating the robot was to identify \"time consuming and less favorable\" tasks for employees, with avocado peeling the first labor-intensive task being targeted. \nIn a demo video provided by the company, a case of avocados is emptied into the machine while an employee works to prep other ingredients. The avocado is still mashed by hand, and the other prepared ingredients are added to make the guacamole. \nThe other machine, the \"augmented makeline,\" operates under a table full of ingredients by taking in information about an order, and automatically making a bowl or salad, moving the bowl under the counter and dispensing ingredients. Simpler orders, like bowls and salads, account for some 65% of mobile orders, the company said, meaning it could give employees time to make more complicated orders that involve folding or wrapping tortillas like burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. \nChipotle shares were recently up about 2%. They have recovered from last month's dip from when CEO Brian Niccol announced his departure for Starbucks (SBUX). \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Money Market Account: What You Should Know\nMoney Market Account Guide\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMoney market funds, distinct from money market deposit accounts, are a type of mutual fund that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulations were significantly updated in 2016 that notably include establishing a floating net asset value (NAV) for funds vs. the previous fixed net asset value of $1 per share.\nMoney market savings accounts are deposit accounts rather than transaction accounts, though they do allow up to six withdrawals per month. Money market savings and checking accounts both pay variable interest. Money market checking accounts, also called high-yield checking accounts, have minimum checking transaction and direct deposit requirements, unlike money market savings accounts.\nMoney market accounts are often confused with money market funds, which are a type of mutual fund. Other misconceptions include that money market accounts protect deposits from inflation, which they do not, and deposits are protected from bank failure regardless of amount. As with other types of deposits, money market accounts are only protected up to $250,000 per account.\nMoney market funds are a type of mutual fund. Some types of money market funds include U.S. treasury funds, U.S. Government and Agency funds and tax-free municipal money funds. Another type of money fund is a diversified taxable money fund that invests in such things as commercial paper and repurchase agreements offered by U.S. and foreign corporations.\nMoney market savings and checking accounts, such as those offered by commercial banks, are safe as they are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per account. Money market funds are mutual funds and as such are not insured by the FDIC. Most, however, invest in U.S. government securities and are therefore backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.\nKey Terms\nMoney Market Account\nA money market account is a type of interest-bearing deposit account offered by financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. Money market accounts generally pay higher interest than a traditional passbook savings account and can be accessed, on a limited basis, through checks and debit cards.\nMoney Market Yield\nMoney market yield refers to the rate of return delivered to investors in money market securities, which are highly liquid financial investment securities, rather than interest earned on a money market account. The money market yield can be calculated by taking the yield for the holding period of the security and multiplying by a 360-day bank year divided by the number of days until maturity.\nRetirement Money Market Account\nA retirement money market account is a money market account held within an individual IRA or 401K retirement account. Since this type of money market account is within a tax-deferred account the yield from its investments in money market securities like U.S. treasury securities, is not subject to taxation until the account owner withdraws the funds.\nHot Money\nHot money refers to the velocity of currency moves between financial markets across the world. These types of money transfers are motivated by investors seeking the highest interest on highly liquid money market securities and deposit instruments. As such, hot money flows from countries and banks offering the highest levels of interest on short term money-based securities.\nBreaking the Buck\nThe term “Breaking the buck” refers to what happens when the net asset value (NAV) of a money market fund falls below $1. This can be caused by the money market fund's investment income not offsetting operating expenses or investment losses. This normally occurs when interest rates drop to very low levels, or the fund takes on greater investment risk and incurs unexpected losses.\n4 Factors to Know About the Money Market Reform of 2016\nAn Introduction to Commercial Paper\nBank Discount Rate: What it is, How it Works, Example\nPassbook Loan: Meaning, How it Works, Pros and Cons\nMoney Market Yield: Definition, Calculation, and Example\nJohannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR) in South Africa\nRetail Repurchase Agreement: What It is, How It Works, Example\nAre Money Market Accounts and Money Market Funds Safe?\nMoney Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF)\nInterbank Call Money Market: Overview and Examples\nWhat Is 'Hot Money'?

  "text": "Economics\nEconomics\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAs a field of study, economics allows us to better understand economic systems and the human decision making behind them. Due to the existence of resource scarcity, economics is important because it deals with the study of how societies use/distribute scarce resources and how these processes can be accomplished more efficiently. For some economists, the ultimate goal of economic science is to improve the quality of life for people in their everyday lives, as better economic conditions means greater access to necessities like food, housing, and safe drinking water.1\nThe 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith is widely considered to be the father of contemporary economics. Smith’s book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, is often cited as both his most notable contribution to the field of economics and one of the most influential books ever written. Some of his most famous ideas include the concept of gross domestic product (GDP) and the “invisible hand” behind the free market economy.2\nMacroeconomics and microeconomics are the two primary branches of economics. Macroeconomics focuses on the big picture side of economics, specifically the decisions made by countries and governments that affect an economy as a whole. Microeconomics, meanwhile, is the study of smaller scale decisions made by people and businesses that affect individual markets. Despite their differences, both branches are interdependent of each other and share many overlapping issues.\nThere are four economics concepts that are key to understanding economic decision making: scarcity, supply and demand, incentives, and costs and benefits. Scarcity refers to the fact that valued resources are limited in quantity. Supply and demand, meanwhile, is the relationship between the price of a good or service and the consumer interest in purchasing it, which, for example, can incentivize producers to increase the supply of goods when demand rises and consumers to limit their consumption of certain goods when supplies are scarce. Lastly, cost and benefit is the dynamic between how much a good or service costs to produce/purchase versus the benefit acquired from doing so.\nKey Terms\nEconomics\nEconomics is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services within an economy. As a field of study, economics is concerned with the economics decisions made by individuals, businesses, governments, and entire nations.\nCapital\nIn economics, “capital” refers to assets that are themselves used in the production of goods or for providing services. A broad range of items can be considered capital, including tools and machinery, intellectual property, and financial assets.\nHuman Capital\nHuman capital is a concept used in economics to categorize a worker’s experience, skills, health, and personal attributes that are potentially valuable to a business. Human capital is considered an “intangible asset,” meaning it cannot be listed on the assets portion of a company’s balance sheet.\nCommodity\nA commodity is a raw material or resource that is considered equivalent with other instances of the same good, regardless of the company producing the items in question. Generally speaking, commodities are things used in the production of other goods or services (e.g., grains, metals, oil, etc.), the quality of which typically differs very little across different producers.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of the value created through the goods and services produced in a particular country within a certain time frame.3 There are several types of GDP (e.g., nominal, real, per capita, etc.), all of which provide slightly different information about a country’s financial health.\nLaw of Supply and Demand\nThe law of supply and demand is an economic theory that defines the dynamic between the price of a good or service and a consumer’s willingness to purchase it. The theory posits that, all else being equal, the price of a good tends to increase when supply decreases or demand increases, and vice versa.\nInflation\nIn economics, inflation is a measurement of how much the prices of goods and services are rising within a specific economy. Inflation is intended to be reflective of the decreasing purchasing power of a specific currency for a diversified set of products and services.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measurement of the average change in how much consumers have paid for a basket of consumer goods and services within a specific time period. Reported on a monthly basis by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the CPI is one of the most popular tools for measuring inflation.4\nExplore Economics\nSwiftonomics: The Economic Influence of Taylor Swift\n‘Silver Tsunami’: Challenges & Opportunities of an Aging Population\nFood Insecurity: What It Is and How It Impacts the Economy\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nPublished Jan 05, 2024 \nFood Insecurity and Its Impact on the Economy \nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated Mar 19, 2024 \nGenerative AI and Its Economic Impact: What You Need to Know\nHistorical U.S. Unemployment Rate by Year\nHistorical U.S. Inflation Rate by Year: 1929 to 2024\nBullwhip Effect: Meaning, Example, Impact\nEconomic Sociology Definition\nDemand Destruction: Meaning, Overview and FAQs\nEfficiency Wages: Definition and Reasons Behind Them\nPerformativity: What It Is, How It Works, Evidence\nThe Great Gatsby Curve: What it Means, How it Works, Implications\nAre We Headed for a Hyperinflation?\nPositive Economics History, Theory, Pros and Cons, Example\nThe 7 Best Economics Books of 2024\nGeneration Z (Gen Z): Definition, Birth Years, and Demographics\nWhat Is Money?

The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. \nShares of Waters Corp. (WAT), a provider of analytical laboratory instruments and software, surged 19.8% on Friday to a 52-week high, delivering the top daily performance in the S&P 500. The gains for Waters stock came after the life, materials, food, and environmental sciences supplier reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings per share (EPS). \nCable TV, mobile, and internet service provider Charter Communications (CHTR) also topped sales and profit estimates with its third-quarter results, and its shares jumped 11.9%. The company posted a solid increase in mobile customers, and although Charter lost subscribers to its internet and video services, declines in those areas were less significant than analysts anticipated. Despite Friday's rally, Charter shares remain in negative territory for 2024. \nAlthough semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) posted a third-quarter loss, reflecting the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, its sales for the period came in ahead of forecasts, and its shares gained 7.8%. Intel also struck a positive tone regarding the future of its server and PC businesses, issuing better-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The company has benefitted from an uptick in PC demand driven by the launch of on-device AI features. \nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) shares dropped 10.5%, the heaviest loss of any S&P 500 constituent. Friday's plunge extended steep losses posted by the stock earlier this week as accounting firm EY resigned from its role as auditor for the server and data storage company. Questions about Supermicro's accounting practices came to the forefront over the summer when short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging manipulation by the company. \nPower generation company AES Corp. (AES) reported better-than-expected profits for the third quarter, boosted by increased utilities and renewables earnings, but its shares sank 9.9%. Although companies like AES are expected to benefit from increased power demand from AI data centers, the Virginia-based firm posted a year-over-year decline in revenue, dragged down by lower sales from its energy infrastructure unit. \nAmcor (AMCR) shares slipped 7.8% after the packaging provider missed quarterly sales estimates. Soft consumer demand weighed on Amcor's sales of cartons and containers to consumer goods companies. Destocking in health care packaging represents another headwind for the company. Amcor also announced that it would sell its 50% stake in Bericap North America, a joint venture focused on plastic closures for various packaging applications. \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Which Is Best for You?\nChecking Accounts\nFrequently Asked Questions\nEndorsing a check involves the named recipient of the check signing their name to the back of the check in the spot indicated for endorsement. The act of endorsement signifies receipt and acceptance of the funds transfer from one party to another and allows for deposit or transfer of funds. Check endorsement is also a fraud prevention measure required by banks, as it confirms the identity of the recipient.\nOpening a checking account online is a simple process that involves navigating to the website of the chosen financial institution and clicking on the button indicated for opening a new account. Once the type of account is selected then personal information is entered that includes name, address, phone number, age and social security number. An online account is typically funded by either direct deposit or electronic funds transfer, which can be facilitated at account opening.\nCanceling a check involves contacting the bank on which check was written by mail, in person or electronically and requesting a stop payment order which prevents the check from being honored or cashed. The stop payment order must be requested and received by the bank within 14 days of the date the check was written and typically stays in effect for six months.\nOnline checking accounts that pay interest typically offer higher interest rates than those offered by local brick and mortar banks. They are easy to set up and offer all the advantages of a traditional bank checking account. However, online checking accounts do not offer the in-person customer service of a physical bank in case of questions or issues with the account. They are also potentially more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.\nBanks will honor checks written within six months. After that date banks are not legally required to honor checks, requiring the original writer of the check to issue a new check if the party is willing. Travelers checks and money orders do not expire, however.\nKey Terms\nCheck\nA check is a financial instrument that can be written by the account holder to a merchant or individual to settle debts at the point of sale or transfer money to another person. Checks that are received by merchants or individuals are deposited with their financial institutions are processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system, an electronic funds transfer system that facilitates payment processing in the U.S.\nBounced Check\nA bounced check is a check that can not be processed for payment because the account from which the check is written has nonsufficient funds to cover the check. Bounced checks are also known as bad checks, which can be illegal. Bounced checks are not honored and incur bank penalty charges called NSF fees and are returned to the check writer.\nDebit Card\nA debit card is a card-based payment vehicle for use at merchants or ATMs that directly processes payments or withdrawals from a checking account. Debit cards eliminate the need to write physical checks or carry cash and do not involve interest charges like credit cards.\nCheckbook\nA checkbook is a small booklet of pre-printed paper documents that have the customer checking account number and bank routing number and the check number. Check numbers are sequentially printed on each check in the book. Checkbooks also include a small ledger to record information for checks written such as the check number, check amount, date and merchant or recipient name.\nOverdraft Protection\nOverdraft protection is a checking account feature that covers the amount of any non-sufficient funds on checks written from a customer account. Overdraft protection is usually offered as a credit feature that charges short term interest on the amount of any overdrafts until newly deposited funds within the checking account cover the shortfall.\nFloat Time\nFloat time is the period of time between when a check is written and when it is deposited in the recipient’s account and the amount of the check is transferred from the check writer’s account to the recipient’s account. While float time on checks historically averaged between 2 and 4 days it has been reduced to 1 day since the implementation of the Check 21 Act.\nBest Checking Account Bonuses for November 2024\nBest Checking Accounts for Teens\nBest Joint Checking Accounts for October 2024\nBest Debit Cards and Banking Apps for Kids and Teens for October 2024\nBest Checking Accounts With No ATM Fees\nBest High-Interest Checking Accounts for October 2024—Up to 6.25%\nBest Rewards Checking Accounts of 2024\nHow to Open a Checking Account Online\nHow Often Should You Monitor Your Checking Account?\nCashier’s Check vs. Money Order: What's the Difference?\nOverdraft Protection: Pros and Cons\nIBAN vs. SWIFT Code: What's the Difference?\nHow Do Netspend Cards Work?\nCanceled Check Definition and How To Get a Copy\nNon-Sufficient Funds (NSF): What It Means & How to Avoid Fees\nWhat Is Overdraft Protection?

  "text": "Personal Finance: The Complete Guide\nFrequently Asked Questions\nPersonal finance is about meeting your financial goals and understanding all the routes to do this, from saving and investing, and keeping debt under control, to buying a home to planning for retirement—and coming up with a plan to accomplish these goals.It’s also the name of the industry that provides financial products to meet these goals.\nNot getting control of your personal finances can leave you unprotected when a crisis comes along–whether it’s an illness, an unexpected job loss, or the death of the family breadwinner. The pandemic that began in March 2020 showed all of these issues in sharp relief and showed the importance of planning for emergencies.\nWhat the pandemic showed is that people are a lot more secure if they have an emergency fund, have learned to budget and have created a financial plan–one with a Plan B and Plan C. Those who haven’t done these things, should get busy doing them. It–and the war in Ukraine–are both wake-up calls that stock market crashes can happen abruptly in a crisis and that everyone needs a crisis investment plan.\nFor starters, you need to buy at least the minimum amount for your state. The two types of liability coverage for an auto accident are bodily injury liability (for injury to other people) and property damage liability (for property damage). Bodily injury liability specifies both a per-person liability and a total liability per accident. For any damage outside of that you will need to pay personally, unless you have an umbrella insurance policy to make up the difference.\nIt's certainly looking that way. Even Warren Buffett had to switch to one in 2020. Banking is increasingly done online, budgeting apps are more convenient to use with a phone than a desktop or laptop, and it’s easier to check on your investments. And at work and elsewhere, two-factor authentication pretty much requires having a phone. So goes getting an Uber or Lyft.\nIf you need to move large amounts of money, a wire transfer–either bank to bank or via an agent such as Western Union–is the safest way to go. Expect to pay a fee and review the fine print before you agree to the transfer. It may take a few hours or days, depending on the details. Note that a wire transfer is different from an Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer. Those are used to pay bills or move money between linked accounts.\nKey Terms\nPersonal Finance\nManaging your money—including saving, investing, and setting financial goals—are all part of personal finance. So are areas like budgeting, retirement planning, and saving for your children’s college educations.\nGoogle Stack\nThis free document-scanning and filing app from Google photographs documents like bills and receipts, and stores them as pdfs. It’s only available for Android phones and tablets, not Apple products.\nRoadside Assistance Insurance\nThis is the plan you need when your car breaks down on the road. You can get this coverage from your auto insurance company, or from AAA or your credit card. Even your cellphone provider might offer it. Your vehicle’s age and mileage might be an issue on the coverage you can get, and there will likely be limits on how far you can be towed and how many service calls you get per year. Your car warranty may also cover assistance for a newer car.\nPersonal Financial Statement\nYour assets and liabilities–summarized on a document or spreadsheet–are what constitute a personal financial statement. Subtracting your liabilities. from your assets will yield your net worth. You will need a personal financial statement if you are applying for a mortgage or other loan. It will also let you track your personal worth over time. Interestingly, personal property like jewelry and antiques aren’t generally included in a personal financial statement.\nTicket to Work Program\nPeople with disabilities who hope to return to work often worry that they will lose their Medicare disability coverage. This government program allows them to keep their coverage for at least 8½ years. Ticket Holders can receive employment and other services from qualified service providers.\nExplore Personal Finance\nFinancial Assistance for Native Americans\nBy\nDaniel Thomas Mollenkamp\nUpdated Sep 26, 2024 \nHow to Make Mobile Check Deposits\nWhat Is a Bank Sign-Up Bonus?\nVenmo, Apple Wallet, and Digital Money Guide for Parents\nLife Insurance for the Disabled\nHow Much Does It Cost to Charge an EV on a Road Trip?\nTicket To Work Program: What It Is and How It Works\nEligible Expenses for an ABLE Account\nBenefits for People With Disabilities and Their Parents\nHow Much Money Can You Make and Still Be Eligible for SSI?\nWhat Is a Banking Desert?\nSpecial Needs Trust vs. ABLE Account: What's the Difference?\nRepresentative Payee Bank Account: What It Is and How It Works\nWho Was Andrew W.

  "text": "The IRS Revealed 2025 Changes To Retirement 401(k) and IRA Contribution Limits\nKey Takeaways\nThe IRS announced cost-of-living adjustments for retirement plans and Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) Friday, revealing that the 401(k) limit has increased for 2025.\nIn 2025, workers can contribute up to $23,500 to their 401(k)s, up from $23,000 in 2024.\nStarting in 2025, people aged 60, 61, 62, or 63 who participate in workplace retirement plans can make even greater catch-up contributions of up to $11,250 instead of $7,500.\nRetirement savers can stash more money in their 401(k)s next year. \nFriday, the IRS announced cost-of-living adjustments for retirement plans and IRAs. The 401(k) contribution limit for 2025 is $23,500, up from $23,000 in 2024. However, individual retirement account (IRA) contributions will continue to be $7,000 in 2025, the same as in 2024. \nWorkers over the age of 50 are eligible to make additional contributions to \"catch-up\" as they approach retirement. The catch-up contribution limit for workplace retirement plans will also stay at $7,500 in 2025 for 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and other retirement plans. \nHowever, starting next year, older workers will be able to make even greater catch-up contributions than other workers because of a provision in Secure 2.0, a federal retirement law.1 Beginning in 2025, employees aged 60, 61, 62, or 63 who participate in workplace retirement plans can make catch-up contributions of up to $11,250. \nPhase-Out Ranges For Traditional IRAs Are Increasing In 2025 \nThe IRS has also made some changes to phase-out ranges for traditional and Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs). \nSome people can deduct traditional IRA contributions from their income. However, depending on if that person has a retirement plan at work and their income, that deduction may be phased out or reduced. \nFor individuals covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range has increased. In 2025, it will be between $79,000 and $89,000, up from between $77,000 and $87,000 in 2024. That means individuals making more than $89,000 would receive no deduction while those making between $79,000 and $80,000 would receive a partial deduction. \nFor married couples filing jointly in 2025, if the spouse who contributes to the IRA is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range in 2025 is up to $126,000 and $146,000. \nPeople With Higher Incomes May Be Eligible For Roth Contributions In 2025 \nAnd the income phase-out ranges for Roth IRAs are changing in 2025 too. \nIn 2025, the phase-out range for singles and heads of household is between $150,000 and $165,000, up from between $146,000 and $161,000. \nTherefore, in 2025, people making between $150,000 and $165,000 would be able to make reduced Roth IRA contributions, while those making above that amount would be ineligible to make any contributions. \nFor married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range for Roth IRAs increased to between $236,000 and $246,000.\nBuy, Trade, and Hold 350+ Cryptocurrencies\nJoin 120 million registered users exchanging the world's most popular cryptocurrencies.

  "text": "Markets News, Nov. 1, 2024: Nasdaq Snaps 7-Week Winning Streak Despite Rally After Big-Tech Earnings, Jobs Report\nStocks rose Friday as investors digested the latest results from large technology companies and labor market data that reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates. \nThe S&P 500 rose 0.4% Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite added 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Stocks recovered somewhat from sharp losses on Thursday that were led by a sell-off in tech stocks after a busy few days of earnings releases. \nThursday's downturn pushed the major indexes into negative territory for the month of October. It was the first time since July that the Nasdaq didn't record a monthly gain. The S&P 500 and Dow, meanwhile, had five-month winning streaks snapped. \nEven with Friday's gains, all three indexes finished the week lower. The Nasdaq snapped a seven-week winning streak, while the S&P and Dow suffered a second consecutive week of losses. \nThe October jobs report, released early Friday, showed that U.S. employers added far fewer jobs than expected last month, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%. The monthly report has taken on particular importance as the Fed has recently expressed concern about labor market weakening. The Fed, which cut its benchmark rate for the first time in four years in September, is scheduled to announce a decision on interest rates next Thursday. \nThe yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is sensitive to expectations around interest rates, was at 4.38% in recent trading, up from 4.28% on Thursday. The benchmark yield, which fell as low as 4.22% just after the labor market numbers were released Friday, has been rising in recent weeks as market participants have recalibrated their thinking about how aggressive the Fed will be in cutting rates in the months ahead. \nTech stocks spearheaded the move higher Friday, led by Amazon (AMZN), which gained more than 6% after the company reported strong results driven by growth in its cloud and advertising businesses. Shares of Intel (INTC) rose nearly 8% after the beleaguered chipmaker reported revenue that topped Wall Street expectations. AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) advanced 2%, while Microsoft (MSFT) ticked higher. \nApple (AAPL) was bucking the tech sector recovery after its quarterly earnings came in shy of expectations. Apple shares slid 1.3% on Friday. \nOutside the tech sector, Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3% after the plane maker reached a tentative deal with its machinists union on a new contract, potentially ending a crippling seven-week strike. ExxonMobil (XOM) slid 1.5% and Chevron (CVX) gained 3% after the oil majors released their quarterly results. \nGold futures were little changed at around $2,740 an ounce, after rising above $2,800 for the first time earlier this week. Bitcoin traded around $69,200, down from an earlier high around $71,500. \nBiggest S&P 500 Movers on Friday\n21 hr 31 min ago\nAdvancers \nShares of Waters Corp. (WAT), a provider of analytical laboratory instruments and software, surged 19.8% on Friday to a 52-week high, delivering the top daily performance in the S&P 500. The gains for Waters stock came after the life, materials, food, and environmental sciences supplier reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings per share (EPS).\nCable TV, mobile, and internet service provider Charter Communications (CHTR) also topped sales and profit estimates with its third-quarter results, and its shares jumped 11.9%. The company posted a solid increase in mobile customers, and although Charter lost subscribers to its internet and video services, declines in those areas were less significant than analysts anticipated. Despite Friday's rally, Charter shares remain in negative territory for 2024.\nAlthough semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) posted a third-quarter loss, reflecting the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, its sales for the period came in ahead of forecasts, and its shares gained 7.8%. Intel also struck a positive tone regarding the future of its server and PC businesses, issuing better-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The company has benefitted from an uptick in PC demand driven by the launch of on-device AI features.\nDecliners \nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) shares dropped 10.5%, the heaviest loss of any S&P 500 constituent. Friday's plunge extended steep losses posted by the stock earlier this week as accounting firm EY resigned from its role as auditor for the server and data storage company. Questions about Supermicro's accounting practices came to the forefront over the summer when short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging manipulation by the company.\nPower generation company AES Corp. (AES) reported better-than-expected profits for the third quarter, boosted by increased utilities and renewables earnings, but its shares sank 9.9%. Although companies like AES are expected to benefit from increased power demand from AI data centers, the Virginia-based firm posted a year-over-year decline in revenue, dragged down by lower sales from its energy infrastructure unit.\nAmcor (AMCR) shares slipped 7.8% after the packaging provider missed quarterly sales estimates. Soft consumer demand weighed on Amcor's sales of cartons and containers to consumer goods companies. Destocking in health care packaging represents another headwind for the company. Amcor also announced that it would sell its 50% stake in Bericap North America, a joint venture focused on plastic closures for various packaging applications.\n-Michael Bromberg\nFive Stocks To Watch in November—and What To Watch For\n23 hr 15 min ago\nThe stock market kicked off November on a high note after slumping to close out last month, while uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve's next moves on interest rates hang over the market. \nThird-quarter earnings season will wind down in November with some big names including Nvidia (NVDA) and Home Depot (HD). But the presidential election on Nov. 5 is likely to dominate headlines and move markets most profoundly this month. \nSee here for more on five stocks that are likely to be in the spotlight this month. \n-Colin Laidley \nWhat to Expect from Berkshire Hathaway Earnings Saturday\nNovember 01, 2024 02:41 PM EDT\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) is set to report its third-quarter earnings on Saturday morning. \nMarket watchers will also look out for how Buffett's portfolio changed, given the very public trimming of Bank of America (BAC) shares. \nDespite citing a lack of new investment opportunities, Buffett increased the firm's stake in Sirius XM last quarter. \nOperating income in the second quarter was driven by gains in the insurance business as claim costs eased. The health of the insurance business will be in focus for the third quarter. \nRead the full preview here. \n-Mrinalini Krishna \nAtlassian Leads Nasdaq Gainers as AI Demand Boosts Results\nNovember 01, 2024 01:56 PM EDT\nAtlassian (TEAM) shares skyrocketed Friday after the business-software company posted better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its guidance as demand for artificial intelligence technology sent subscriptions surging. \nThe company behind project-tracking tool Jira reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings per share of $0.77, with revenue jumping 21.5% to $1.19 billion. Both exceeded estimates. Subscription revenue rose 33%. \nAtlassian now projects full-year revenue growth of 16.5% to 17% and a cloud revenue rise of 24%. That’s up from its earlier projection of a revenue gain of 16% and cloud revenue rise of 23% for the year. \nCFO Joe Binz added the company continues to focus its investment and execution “against our key strategic priorities of serving the enterprise, delivering AI innovation, and further bringing together technology and business teams.” \nTradingView\nShares of Atlassian were up 20% in recent trading, leading Nasdaq gainers, at their highest level since February. The stock is still down 5% in 2024.\n-Bill McColl \nSpectrum Parent Charter Surges After Strong Earnings\nNovember 01, 2024 01:09 PM EDT\nCharter Communications (CHTR) shares jumped Friday after the cable TV, mobile, and internet services provider reported better-than-anticipated results as it lost fewer subscribers than expected. \nThe Spectrum parent posted third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $8.82, with revenue up 1.6% to $13.8 billion. Both figures were above analysts' forecasts compiled by Visible Alpha. \nCharter's internet customers declined by 110,000 to 30.3 million, and video customers slid 294,000 to 13.2 million. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for 30.1 million and 12.9 million, respectively. \nThe communications giant also posted a big jump in mobile customers, as those using Charter’s mobile lines jumped 26% to 9.4 million, more than anticipated. \nCharter shares were up about 13% in intraday trading Friday, though even with Friday's gains, they've lost close to 5% of their value since the start of the year. \n-Bill McColl \nAmazon Soars on Optimism About AI Growth\nNovember 01, 2024 12:29 PM EDT\nAmazon (AMZN) shares jumped Friday as multiple analysts raised their price targets for the e-commerce giant following third-quarter results that topped expectations. \nWedbush upped its price target to $250 from $225, pointing to Amazon's surging artificial intelligence (AI) business. \nOn the company's earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon's AI business is growing three times faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division, did at the same stage in its development. \nCloud revenue jumped 19% year-over-year to more than $27 billion amid surging demand for AI. In terms of investment, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, the majority of which will go toward technology infrastructure to support AI demand, according to a transcript of the earnings call provided by AlphaSense. \nJPMorgan analysts are \"comfortable\" with the increase in expenditures given Amazon's \"very clear path to AI monetization through AWS,\" the firm said, raising its price target to $250 from $230. \nTradingView\nShares of Amazon were up nearly 7% at around $200 in recent trading, not far from their all-time high. The stock has now gained than 31% year-to-date. \n-Andrew Kessel \nAbbott Shares Jump After Baby Formula Legal Ruling\nNovember 01, 2024 11:21 AM EDT\nShares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) surged Friday, a day after a jury cleared infant formula makers of liability for a boy's debilitating intestinal disease. \nThe ruling by a Missouri state court jury Thursday is a rare legal win for Abbott Laboratories, maker of the Similac formula, and British-Dutch company Reckitt Benckiser, which produces the Mead Johnson formula, following their losses in similar trials involving necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening disease that affects the colon and intestine. \n\"The decision reinforces what we, the medical community and regulatory bodies have said: that preterm infant nutrition products are safe, and there is no reliable scientific evidence that they cause or contribute to cause NEC,\" Abbott said in a statement to Investopedia. \n\"This is the first victory for the two companies in a NEC state case after Abbott was ordered to pay $495m in July in the Gill case and Reckitt's Mead Johnson $60m in March in the Watson case,\" UBS analysts wrote Friday. \nAbbot shares were up more than 5% in recent trading. \n-Nisha Gopalan \nIt's Been a Wild Week for Trump Media Stock\nNovember 01, 2024 10:28 AM EDT\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), majority owned by former President Donald Trump, were recently down slightly at around $35. This week the stock has risen as high as 40% above last Friday’s close near $39 and slid nearly 15% below it. That's meant big swings in the market value of the Republican presidential nominee's majority stake, which nevertheless is worth billions of dollars. \nAnd that’s on little in the way of actual news about the company, which operates the Truth Social platform. Instead, traders have seized on the story as a way to wager the outcome of the presidential election, seen broadly as a race between Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \nPolls generally point toward a close contest ahead of Election Day. \nOn some prediction markets, speculators seem to more strongly believe in the likelihood of a Trump win: On Polymarket, for example, traders have generally backed a more-than-60% likelihood of a Trump victory for most of this week; those odds were a bit lower on some other platforms. (Here's Investopedia's guide to elections betting,) \nMeanwhile, Trump Media shares have moved dramatically, with trading in the stock subjected to volatility-based halts multiple times this week. At one point, the shares traded at levels not seen since the high-flying days after their debut on public markets earlier this year. \nFor now, they’re back around July levels after climbing off October lows. \nTradingView\n-David Marino-Nachison \nBoeing Shares Rise After New Deal With Union Reached\nNovember 01, 2024 09:15 AM EDT\nBoeing (BA) shares were gaining ground in premarket trading Friday after the plane maker reached a tentative deal with its machinists union on a new contract, potentially ending a crippling seven-week strike. \nThe International Association of Machinists (IAM) is asking its members to approve the sweetened offer from Boeing in a vote on Monday. Their members have been on strike since Sept. 13. \n\"In every negotiation and strike, there is a point where we have extracted everything that we can in bargaining and by withholding our labor,\" IAM District 751 said Thursday. \"We are at that point now and risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.\" \nWorkers picket outside a Boeing Co. facility during a strike in Everett, Washington, on Sept. 16, 2024. \nM. Scott Brauer / Bloomberg via Getty Images\nThe new offer includes a 38% general wage increase over four years, higher than the previous offer of 35%. That \"compounds to 43.65% over the life of the agreement,\" the union said. The new offer will also give workers the option of a $12,000 one-time ratification bonus; 401(k) contribution; or \"a combination of both,\" the union said. \nThe strike has been painful for Boeing, which is raising billions of dollars to stem a cash drain. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kelly Ortberg, who stepped into the role in August, said in a memo to employees last month that the plane maker plans to lay off about 10% of its workforce, or 17,000 workers, \"over the coming months\" and is postponing the launch of its first 777x jetliner. \nBoeing shares, which are up 2% in premarket trading, have lost more than 40% of their value this year through Thursday's close. \n-Nisha Gopalan \nAmazon Prices Levels to Watch After Post-Earnings Surge\nNovember 01, 2024 08:23 AM EDT\nAmazon (AMZN) shares were up more than 7% in premarket trading after the company surpassed Wall Street’s third-quarter earnings estimates. \nThe stock sits poised to break out from a symmetrical triangle following the company’s better-than-expected quarterly report. \nSource: TradingView.com. \nInvestors should watch key overhead price levels on Amazon's chart around $200, $242, and $273, while also monitoring an important support area during profit taking periods near $192. \nRead the full technical analysis piece here. \n-Timothy Smith \nStock Futures Higher Ahead of Jobs Report\nNovember 01, 2024 08:02 AM EDT\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.4%. \nTradingView\nS&P 500 futures were also up 0.4%. \nTradingView\nNasdaq 100 futures also gained 0.4%. \nTradingView\nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "What We Learned About AI From This Week's Big Tech Earnings\nKey Takeaways\nTech companies have dramatically increased their spending on infrastructure this year as they've raced to satisfy surging demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\nMost cloud providers said despite all that spending, they're struggling to keep up with demand.\nAI has boosted growth at cloud computing units and, according to executives, is lifting sales and metrics in other segments of their businesses.\nBig Tech's AI boom is still on. \nArtificial intelligence was the focus of the five tech giants, cumulatively valued at more than $10 trillion, that reported quarterly earnings this week. Executives at Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) touted the progress their companies have made incorporating AI into their operations and rolling out new AI features for customers. They also spoke to the strength of AI demand—and the challenges they've met trying to meet it. \nInvestors now turn their attention to the last of the Magnificent Seven companies to report: Nvidia (NVDA), whose results are due Nov. 20. Its stock surged to a record high last month as investors anticipated that this week’s earnings would contain evidence of booming demand for its AI chips. \nSpending on AI Infrastructure Is Surging... \nBig Tech’s spending on infrastructure has skyrocketed this year. Cloud providers have raced to build out their AI operations and meet surging demand for cloud computing. \nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta spent a cumulative $60 billion on property and equipment in the third quarter, a 60% increase from the same period last year, according to an Investopedia analysis. All four indicated that infrastructure investments would continue to increase next year. \nSurging infrastructure expenses hung over tech giants during their last round of earnings reports in July, when Wall Street was antsy to see evidence that investments were paying off. Those fears seem to have abated somewhat with this week’s reports. \n... But Clouds Can't Grow Fast Enough \nA common refrain from tech executives this week was that they can’t keep up with demand. \nMicrosoft on Wednesday warned that growth at its cloud unit could slow in its second fiscal quarter. AI demand “continues to be higher than our available capacity,” according to CFO Amy Hood. \nHer comments were echoed by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday, who said Amazon Web Services was also having difficulty meeting cloud computing demand. \nA shortage of the most advanced semiconductors, Jassy said, was the main bottleneck. \nAI's Growth Is Boosting Business \nDespite capacity constraints, AI is still driving growth for tech giants. \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company’s AI business was on track to reach an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion in the current quarter, making it “the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone.” Jassy on Thursday said Amazon’s AI business is growing by triple-digit percentages, three times faster than cloud computing grew in its early stages. \nAlphabet executives said they expected AI investments to “translate to revenue in the fairly short term.” AI Overviews in Google search were being monetized at “approximately the same rate” as older formats, he said, boosting confidence that AI can boost Alphabet’s core ad business as well as its cloud unit. \nMeta also touted the benefits it’s seeing from AI. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI-driven feed recommendations had increased the time users spent on Facebook and Instagram this year, and that businesses using Meta’s generative AI advertising tools had seen an increase in conversions. \nApple reported record September-quarter iPhone and total revenue on Thursday. CEO Tim Cook noted on a call with analysts that iPhone users were adopting Apple's newest operating system, the Apple Intelligence-enabled iOS 18.1, at twice the rate of its predecessor, which the firm took as an early indication of strong demand for its custom AI.",

(There was at least one interesting report Friday: The New York Post said some investors believe Tesla (TSLA) CEO and X owner Elon Musk might look to acquire the company.) \nPolls generally point toward a close contest ahead of Election Day.1 On some prediction markets, speculators seem to more strongly believe in the likelihood of a Trump win: On Polymarket, for example, traders have generally backed a more-than-60% likelihood of a Trump victory for most of this week; those odds were a bit lower on some other platforms.23 (Here's Investopedia's guide to elections betting,) \nMeanwhile, Trump Media shares have moved dramatically, with trading in the stock subjected to volatility-based halts multiple times this week. At one point, the shares traded at levels not seen since the high-flying days after their debut on public markets earlier this year. \nFor now, they’re back around July levels after climbing off September lows. \nUpdate: This article has been updated to reflect fresh share price information and to incorporate the New York Post article.",

  "text": "Five Stocks to Watch in November—and What to Watch For\nThe stock market kicked off November on a high note after slumping to close out last month, while uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve's next moves on interest rates hang over the market. \nA sharp downturn on Thursday, led by a sell-off in technology stocks, sent major indexes into negative territory for October. The S&P 500 and Dow snapped five-month winning streaks while the Nasdaq Composite failed to post a monthly gain for the first time since July. \nThird-quarter earnings season will wind down in November with some big names including Nvidia (NVDA) and Home Depot (HD). But the presidential election on Nov. 5 is likely to dominate headlines and move markets most profoundly this month. Below, we look at some stocks that could see big price movements. \nNvidia \nNvidia is scheduled to report its third-quarter results on Nov. 20, and investor attention will be squarely focused on the world’s largest chip company in the lead-up to those results.1 \nAnalysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the long-term potential for Nvidia’s stock, which nearly 4 in 5 analysts rate a “Buy,” according to Wall Street Journal data. Bank of America (BofA) analysts in a recent note called Nvidia “a generational opportunity,” citing its dominant position within an artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market that they expect to quadruple in size to $280 billion by 2027.2 \nU.S. cloud providers are expected to spend more than $200 billion on infrastructure this year, with much of that spending going toward the data centers and chips that train and run AI models. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% share of the AI chip market, is by far the largest beneficiary of that spending. \nNvidia stock has gained nearly 170% this year after surging more than 200% last year. But with the stock’s banner performance has come high expectations. Shares slumped more than 6% the day after Nvidia handily beat second-quarter earnings estimates in late August. \nTrump Media & Technology Group \nThe daily movement of Trump Media & Technology Group's (DJT) stock has effectively become a proxy for former president Donald Trump’s odds of returning to the White House in January. No other stock is so widely seen as an indicator of voter sentiment, nor does any other company’s fortunes hinge so directly on the outcome of November’s election. \nShares more than doubled in value in October as polls showed Trump closing the gap with Vice President Kamala Harris in national polls. In the lead-up to Nov. 5, DJT's share price will likely continue to mirror betting odds on popular platforms like PolyMarket, PredictIt, and, as of Monday, even Robinhood (HOOD). \nGiven how close polls suggest the election will be, DJT is likely to remain volatile, especially if legal challenges to the results play out in courts across the country. \nHome Depot \nHome improvement retailer Home Depot is due to report quarterly earnings mid-month, and investors will be hoping the results contain signs of a turnaround for the U.S. housing market. \nMortgage rates declined steadily throughout most of the third quarter, falling from around 7% on average in early July to as low as 5.9% in mid-September when the Federal Reserve began cutting its benchmark interest rate. \nNew home listings reached a three-year high in September 2024, according to data from Realtor.com, as rate cuts and optimism eased the “lock-in effect” of elevated interest rates. At the end of September, there were more homes for sale than at any other time since April 2020. That could bode well for Home Depot, the business of which depends in large part on homeowners making pre-listing improvements. \nThat said, a rising 10-year Treasury yield has nudged mortgage rates higher in recent weeks. Wall Street has tempered its expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue aggressively cutting rates this year and next. Uncertainty about the presidential election and the impact of each candidate’s policies on the economy have also contributed to the increase in yields. Rising yields could cloud Home Depot’s outlook, as they did for homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) whose stock sank when its earnings guidance fell short of estimates. \nHome Depot shares have risen about 15% so far this year. \nIntel \nNo company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has had a tougher year than Intel (INTC). The once-dominant U.S. chipmaker has struggled to maintain its technological edge over international rivals and is now in the middle of a massive turnaround effort. \nIntel shares have lost more than 50% of their value this year as the chipmaker has reported massive losses—$16 billion in the third quarter alone—stemming from sluggish demand for computer chips and big expenses at its chip foundry business. The firm’s limited exposure to artificial intelligence has also weighed on sentiment. \nCEO Pat Gelsinger has implemented a $10 billion cost-cutting plan, which includes laying off about 15% of the company’s employees and suspending its dividend. Intel's third-quarter results suggested that effort may be starting to bear fruit. The company beat estimates with its quarterly revenue and its sales outlook. \nStill, with the company appearing in dire straits, the vultures are circling. Qualcomm (QCOM) has reportedly considered making an offer to buy at least some of Intel’s assets. Alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management has reportedly offered the company a $5 billion investment. \nThe presidential election will have consequences for U.S. trade policy and Sino-American relations, both important to Intel insofar as they impact its chief rival, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Trump recently vowed to impose stiff tariffs on Taiwan-made semiconductors to support U.S. fabricators like Intel. \nBoeing \nBoeing’s (BA) 2024 has been nearly as rough as Intel’s. \nThe jet maker's stock has fallen 40% this year as it's dealt with the fallout from a door-plug blowout in early January. The company has burned through billions of dollars in its efforts to retool its operations and revive its public image. \nBoeing's problems were compounded in September when more than 30,000 union employees went on strike, a work stoppage that analysts estimate has cost Boeing as much as $100 million a day.3 Negotiators at the end of October reached a tentative contract deal that includes a 38% pay increase over the next 4 years, a boosted 401(k) match, and a $12,000 ratification bonus. The proposal does not reinstate Boeing's defined-benefit pension plan, a key worker demand.4 \nBoeing recently raised more than $21 billion through a public stock offering intended to help the company weather the strike, which has hamstrung manufacturing and, depending on the outcome of a union vote on Nov. 4, could stretch into its third month in November. \nAnalysts have called ending the strike “a clearing event” that could set the stage for Boeing’s turnaround.\nThis is how you can buy stocks with 0% commission\nDo you feel you are overpaying in commission when you trade and invest in stocks?

  "text": "An IRS Ruling Could Open Up 401(k) Matches for Student Loans, Medical Payments\nKey Takeaways\nThe IRS in August determined that a company could change its retirement plan to give employees the option of allocating their 401(k) matching contributions toward their student loan repayments or medical expenses.\nDuring open enrollment, employees would make an annual election for those matching contributions.\nThis ruling only applies to one company, but since the 2022 enactment of Secure 2.0 legislation, all employers have the option to give their employees the ability to use matching contributions to pay off their student loans.\nThe IRS has allowed workers at one company use to use 401(k) matching contributions to pay for medical and student loan expenses, indicating the possibility that others might someday be able to do the same. \nThe agency in an August ruling determined that a company, which it didn't name, could allow its workers to allocate matching contribution to their 401(k), retiree health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), health savings account (HSA), or an educational assistance program used to pay off student loans.1\nDuring open enrollment, employees would make an annual election for those matching contributions. If the employee doesn't make a choice, those contributions are allocated to their 401(k). \nWhile the private letter ruling only applies to one company, under the Secure 2.0 Act—a federal retirement law passed in 2022—all companies can now offer employees matching contributions to pay off student loans. This change went into effect at the beginning of 2024, but it's unclear how many employers currently offer the benefit or plan to in the future. (Private letter rulings often are made and released months after an entity makes a request.2) \nFlexibility Could Help Workers, But Can Come at a Cost \nThis move, if undertaken at the company that made the IRS request, would give employees the option to use matching contributions to pay off student loans or to stash money in an HSA, but could come at the cost of missed retirement savings down the road, according to Melissa Caro, a certified financial planner (CFP). \n\"Ultimately, the best approach is to contribute as much as possible to your 401(k), including the employer match,\" Caro said in an email. \"If debt needs attention, cutting back elsewhere may help you manage it better, rather than diverting from your retirement savings.\" \nShe does, however, note that an HSA can provide tax savings and be used to pay off health expenses in retirement. \nAnd some might benefit from using the match to pay off student loans: “For high-interest student loans [above 7%], using your match for repayment can make sense,\" wrote Priya Malani, founder of Stash Wealth, in an email. \nUpdate: This article has been updated to add the comment from Malani. \n10 years of crypto trading and counting\nTrade the world’s leading cryptoassets on a platform trusted by millions of traders worldwide. \nCryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries.

  "text": "Exxon and Chevron Report Sluggish Profits\nKey Takeaways\nExxon Mobil and Chevron saw significant declines in profit margins for refined products.\nConsumers benefited as fuel prices, which typically rise in summer, dropped this year.\nAs a result, earnings for both oil and gas conglomerates fell during the third quarter from the same period a year ago.\nOil-and-gas giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) surpassed subdued third-quarter earnings expectations Friday. But substantially weaker profit margins for refined products, reflecting lower summer fuel prices, dropped overall net income for both companies from a year ago. \nExxon reported net income of $8.6 billion, or $1.92 per share.1 That beat the consensus projection as tracked by Visible Alpha. But profits fell 5% from the same period a year ago and 7% from this year's second quarter. Year-to-year profits at Exxon have declined in five of the past six quarters. \nChevron suffered a steeper earnings hit from a year ago. The company reported net income of $4.5 billion, or $2.48 per share.2 Profits fell 31% from the same period a year ago, though they increased marginally from this year's second quarter. \nChevron's shares were 3% higher in afternoon trading, while Exxon's were off nearly 1%. \nFuel Price Impact \nExxon said its \"significantly weaker industry refining margins\" declined from historically high levels as \"supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand.\" \nIndeed, average U.S. prices for all gasoline grades fell to $3.48 per gallon during the quarter, down 10% from $3.87 in last year's third quarter. Average diesel prices dropped to $3.69 per gallon from $4.48, down 18%. \nU.S. fuel prices peaked late this winter and early this spring, a seasonal anomaly that helped consumers and the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. But for energy producers, falling prices of oil, natural gas, and fuel have reduced the historically strong profits they enjoyed in late 2022 and much of 2023.\nTrust TrustPilot: try 4.4/5 rated eToro\nThe app review platform rates eToro as an excellent trading and investing platform.

  "text": "Peloton Stock Price Levels to Watch After Upbeat Earnings, Naming of New CEO\nKey Takeaways\nPeloton shares were down sharply Friday, giving back a chunk of the near-30% gain recorded yesterday after the fitness equipment maker announced a new CEO and reported better-than-expected results.\nThe stock has trended higher after forming a double bottom, with the price staging a breakaway gap yesterday following the company’s upbeat earnings. However the relative strength index warns of extremely overbought conditions\nInvestors should watch important resistance levels on Peloton's chart around $9.50 and $13, while monitoring key support levels near $6.70 and $5.\nShares in Peloton Interactive (PTON) were down sharply Friday, giving back a chunk of the near-30% gain recorded yesterday after the fitness equipment maker announced a new chief executive officer and reported better-than-expected quarterly results.1 \nThe company said it had appointed Ford (F) and former Apple (AAPL) executive Peter Stern as its new CEO. Stern currently heads the legacy automakers’ digital business services, and while at Apple, oversaw a range a subscription services, including Apple Fitness+.2 \nOn the earnings front, Peloton posted a significantly narrower-than-expected loss during the quarter, indicating the company’s cost-cutting initiatives had begun to deliver results as it works on a turnaround effort to reinvigorate sales after a post-pandemic demand slump. \nPeloton shares were down 13% at $7.40 in mid-afternoon trading Friday, cutting the stock's year-to-date gain to around 22%. \nBelow, we navigate Peloton’s chart using technical analysis and identify key price levels worth watching out for. \nNews-Driven Breakaway Gap \nSince breaking out above the neckline of a double bottom pattern earlier this month, Peloton shares continued trending higher, with the stock’s price staging a breakaway gap yesterday following the company’s upbeat news events. \nImportantly, Thursday’s move occurred on the highest trading volume since late August, signaling buying participation by larger market players, such as institutional investors and asset managers. \nHowever, while the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, it also warns of extremely overbought conditions with a reading above the 80 threshold. \nLet’s take a look at important chart levels on Peloton’s chart that investors may be watching following yesterday's news-driven buying. \nImportant Resistance Levels to Monitor \nAmid a move higher, investors should monitor how the shares respond to the $9.50 level. This area on the chart could attract selling pressure near a trendline connecting the March trough and several peaks from June to August last year \nA close above this level could fuel a bullish move up to around $13, a location where investors may look to lock in profits near the prominent December 2022 swing high, which also corresponds with a range of similar trading levels on the chart between February and March 2023. \nKey Support Levels to Watch \nUpon an initial pullback, such as Friday's move lower, investors may look for buying opportunities near the stock's pre-breakout level around $6.70, a region on the chart that closely aligns with a range of peaks and troughs between May 2023 and January this year. \nFinally, a deeper retracement could see the shares revisit lower support around $5, where bargain hunters may seek entry points near the double bottom pattern’s neckline. \nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

  "text": "Best 6-Month CD Rates for November 2024: Up to 5.50%\nToday's best 6-month CD rate is 5.50% APY, available from Nuvision Credit Union for 8 months on deposits from $1,000 to $5,000. That's more than three times what you can earn with a CD paying the FDIC's national average rate of 1.75% for 6 months, and is one of more than 15 leading offers in our ranking below. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Nov. 1, 2024.1 \nCDs come with guaranteed returns, so you know what you'll earn at the end of the term. For example, if you deposit $20,000 in a CD with an APY of 5.00%, you'd earn about $494 after 6 months. \nEvery weekday since 2019, we review CD rates from hundreds of nationally available banks and credit unions. Our list of the top 6-month CDs below includes the best-paying options with terms of 5 to 9 months. In addition to rates, we also look at the minimum deposit and early withdrawal penalties for every ranked CD.\nIn the News\nIt's widely expected that the Fed will cut rates again by 25 basis points at its meeting on Nov. 6-7, which could mean lower CD rates are coming, too. At its September meeting, the Fed cut rates for the first time since 2020, reducing the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%–5.00%. The federal funds rate had been at a two-decade high after 11 increases from March 2022 through July 2023 in an effort to bring down inflation.234\nBest 6-Month CD Rates \nNuvision Credit Union – 5.50% APY*\nNewtek Bank – 5.25% APY\nDigital Federal Credit Union – 5.00% APY\nMills42 Federal Credit Union – 5.00% APY*\nVibrant Credit Union – 5.00% APY*\nValley Direct – 5.00% APY*\nPoppy Bank – 5.00% APY\nAlabama Credit Union – 5.00% APY\nAllegacy Federal Credit Union – 5.00% APY\nPrime Alliance Bank – 4.90% APY\nAdelfi – 4.86% APY\nBank5 Connect – 4.85% APY\nTotalBank – 4.85% APY\nTampa Bay Federal Credit Union – 4.85% APY\nHeritage Bank – 4.81% APY\nOur ranking of the highest CD rates includes terms of 5–9 months. In cases where more than one institution pays the same annual percentage yield, we've prioritized CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring a smaller minimum deposit, and if still a tie, alphabetically by institution name. \nHow to Find the Best CDs in Other Terms\nIf you're interested in CDs shorter or longer than 6 months, you may also like reviewing our overall ranking of the best nationwide CD rates.\nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia collects and analyzes CD rates from over 200 banks to identify the best deals available.

When choosing a CD, we always recommend looking for one with a high interest rate, a minimum deposit that you can afford, and a term that works for your timeline. If you can't find a top nationwide CD that meets your needs, you can look at a big-name banks and credit unions. Just be sure you have done your rate homework, so you know what's a reasonably competitive rate—and who is paying peanuts. \nHere are a few large banks and credit unions you may want to explore:\nChase Bank CD Rates\nBank of America CD Rates\nNavy Federal CD Rates\nWells Fargo CD Rates\nCiti CD Rates\nU.S. Bank CD Rates\nTD Bank CD Rates\nCapital One CD Rates\nPNC Bank CD Rates\nCharles Schwab CD Rates\nPenFed CD Rates\nWhat Is a 6-Month CD?\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) are financial products that provide a fixed interest rate on your deposit as long as you leave your money with the issuing bank or credit union for a specified period of time. Maturity periods range from as short as one month to as long as 10 years. However, terms between 6 months and 5 years are the most common. \nVirtually all CDs are offered by federally insured banks or credit unions, with bank deposits protected by FDIC insurance and credit union deposits guaranteed by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). This means that deposits up to $250,000 are secure, even if the institution itself falls into financial trouble.5 As a result, always check that any institution you're considering starting a relationship with is an FDIC or NCUA member. \nDepository institutions set their own interest rates for CDs, and those rates can differ dramatically from one bank or credit union to another. According to the data Investopedia compiles from about 200 CD-issuing institutions across the country, the top certificates pay three to five times more than the industry average for products of the same duration—and sometimes even eight to 10 times more. So it's always smart to shop around for a certificate that pays on the higher end of the rate spectrum.\nPros and Cons of 6-Month CDs\nPros\nOffers a locked rate for 6 months: Unlike a savings or money market account, whose rate can be reduced at any time, a 6-month CD is guaranteed to pay the agreed upon APY for the full six months.\nCan deter temptation to spend down savings: Since withdrawing funds from a CD will incur a penalty, it can be less tempting to withdraw CD funds for an unplanned purchase than it is to dip into a liquid savings account.\nMay pay more than a savings account: By agreeing to a 6-month CD term, you may be able to score a higher annual percentage yield (APY) than what you can earn on a savings or money market account.\nCarries almost no risk: CDs opened with an FDIC bank or NCUA credit union are federally insured against potential institution failure, meaning up to $250,000 of your deposits—per person and per institution—are protected.\nCons\nWithdrawing early will incur a penalty: Anytime you request to cash out a CD before its maturity date, the bank or credit union will hit you with an early withdrawal penalty, which will reduce the interest you earned and the balance you're paid out.\nOnly one deposit is allowed: The amount of your CD will be the amount of your initial deposit. Except for special \"add-on CDs,\" you cannot deposit additional funds in a CD after it's opened.\nIf rates rise, you'll be locked at a lower APY: If the economy is seeing rising rates, you may find you're locked into a 6-month rate that is worse than you can get with newer CDs.\nIf rates drop, you may regret not opening a longer CD: In a declining rate environment, you'll be happy to have your 6-month rate guaranteed, but may wish you had extended it further with a longer-term certificate.\nFast Fact\nWhen asked in September where they are investing their money, 13% of Investopedia readers said they are putting more into CDs, behind ETFs, individual stocks, index funds, and money market funds.\nHow Much Does $10,000 Earn in a 6-Month CD?\nHere's how much interest you'd earn if you deposited $10,000 in a 6-month CD, at a few different APYs. CD rates change often, and locking in a high interest rate today can pay off if rates drop. \nDeposit Amount APY Term Earnings \n$10,000\t5.00%\t6 months\t$253.15\t\n$10,000\t5.30%\t6 months\t$268.54\t\n$10,000\t5.55%\t6 months\t$281.39\t\nHow to Find the Best 6-Month CD Rates\nTo make it easy for you to find the best CD rates, Investopedia tracks over 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs. Like other CDs, the rates for 6-month CDs depend on the federal funds rate; as the federal funds rate goes up, CDs tend to, as well. If the fed rate goes up, it might be a good time to look for a new CD. \nThe list above features many internet-only banks and credit unions. Internet-only financial service companies tend to have lower operating costs than brick-and-mortar institutions, so they may offer better rates and lower fees. \nBefore deciding on one of the CDs above, you may want to explore local or regional banks and credit unions in your area. Our list of the top CDs only includes CDs that are available nationwide. Although the rates above are very good, you may find a better APY at a regional bank or credit union. \nAside from rates, here are some important CD features to look for: \nMinimum opening deposit: Banks and credit unions offer CDs with a variety of minimum opening deposit requirements.\nEarly withdrawal penalties: Different banks impose different withdrawal penalties; if you may need to withdraw money before the term is up, consider no-penalty CDs.\nCD type: CDs come in a variety of types, including promotional CDs, jumbo CDs, bump CDs, brokered CDs, no-penalty CDs, and IRA CDs. Some of these options may give you more flexibility than a conventional CD.\nMembership: Credit unions offer some of the best CDs, but they all have their own membership requirements. Many are inexpensive to join.\nFDIC insurance: Before you open a new account, check that the bank is FDIC-insured to protect your money.\nAlternatives to 6-Month CDs\nSix-month CDs are one of many savings vehicles you can choose from. Below are some other options which may suit you even better. \nShorter or Longer CDs: What CD Term Has the Best Rates? \nIf six months feels too long for you to give up access to your money, you could choose a shorter-term CD. Three months is a commonly offered term, and some institutions even offer 1- and 2-month CDs. Beware, however, that these ultra-short certificates often pay rates that are worse than a high-yield savings or money market account, making them a poor choice. \nIf instead you could stretch to a longer CD term, you may be able to snag a higher APY. But even if the APY is lower, it could be advantageous because it will be locked in for longer—which is useful if rates go down in the future. The market is full of competitive 1-year CD options, for instance, as it is one of the most popular certificate terms, but multi-year CDs will extend your rate guarantee far into the future. \nSee the best rates for a variety of CD terms to explore your options: \nBest CD Rates\nBest 3-month CD rates\nBest 1-year CD rates\nBest 18-month CD rates\nBest 2-year CD rates\nBest 3-year CD rates\nBest 5-year CD rates\nBest 10-year CD rates\nWhen your CD term comes to maturity, the deposit plus interest is released to you. Depending on the bank and the account, you have a few different options. You can keep the money, roll it into a new CD at the same bank, or deposit it into a new account at a different bank. If you don't make a decision, the money may be rolled into a new CD or sent to you. The bank or credit union will usually provide notice of the CD's maturity a month or two ahead of time.\nLiquid Accounts \nUnlike a CD, a liquid account allows you to freely deposit and withdraw funds as you like. Common types of liquid accounts include: \nSavings accounts: The best high-yield savings accounts often pay rates competitive with the best CDs.\nMoney market accounts: The best money market accounts may rival the best CDs, as well.\nCash reserve account: Provided by brokerage firms, these accounts hold your uninvested funds and can sometimes pay rates competitive with high-yield savings and money market accounts, although in many cases they pay much less.\nDepending on the rate environment, either liquid accounts or CDs may offer the best rates. Even if the savings rate you can earn is lower than the best 6-month CD, though, it comes with the no-strings-attached advantage of leaving your funds completely available. \nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"Keep in mind: All the interest you earn [in a CD] is fully taxable—something that can cut into your returns, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket,\" said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council. \"In that case, you may want to consider more tax-efficient options, like municipal bonds or U.S. Treasuries, which can help preserve more of your earnings.\"\nBonds or Bond Funds \nShort-term corporate bonds: Though you can certainly buy a bond mutual fund or ETF and exit whenever you like, keep in mind that unlike CDs, corporate bonds and bond funds can lose value. Bonds are generally less risky than stocks, but their value can still go down.\nU.S. Treasury I bonds: U.S. Treasury I bonds pay an interest rate pegged to beat inflation. However, these bonds are not suited to a six-month horizon as you cannot withdraw the funds for any reason during the first year.\nU.S. Treasury bill: T-bills allow you to lend money to the U.S. government for a short, fixed amount of time. Considered one of the safest investments in the world, T-bills offer durations ranging from 4 weeks to 1 year.6\nStocks\nStocks can be an alternative to a CD if you want to grow your money long-term. While not guaranteed, you may be able to invest in stocks and see returns worth the same or more than what you'd earn in a CD. The average annualized return in the S&P 500 between 1957 and 2023 was 10.26%, which is much higher than the 5% you can get with a 6-month CD.7 However, with stocks, you are not guaranteed returns like with a CD, and it may take years to see an average annualized return of over 10% in your portfolio. If you're interested in investing in stocks, find a brokerage firm or trading platform that meets your needs, and consider investing in both stocks and CDs to maximize your returns and diversify your income investments. \nHow Are CD Rates Determined?\nCD rates are determined by a number of factors, including: \nThe federal funds rate: CD rates (and rates on other interest-bearing deposit accounts) tend to follow the federal funds rate. As the federal rate goes up, CD rates tend to go up as well. This happens in part because when the federal rate goes up banks lend out money at higher interest, so they can pay more interest on deposit accounts.\nCD term length: Longer CD terms may offer better rates than shorter terms, because you're committing to keep the money with the bank longer, but this is not always true—depending on the current rate environment, financial prospects and predictability, and the issuing bank (which may offer promotional rates for certain terms), you may find shorter terms that are equal to or better than longer terms.\nIssuing bank or credit: Different banks have different operating expenses. Big banks like Citi, with massive expenses, tend to offer low rates on most of their CDs. Online banks with lower overhead, like Ally Bank, may offer better rates, and the same tends to be true of credit unions.\nCompetition between banks: Banks compete to attract customers, and higher APYs on CDs and deposit accounts are one way they do that.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre CDs Safe?\nCDs are virtually risk-free savings vehicles, and their safety has two distinct facets. First, a CD offered by an FDIC bank or an NCUA credit union is federally insured. That means even if the institution fails, your deposits up to $250,000 at that institution are protected.\nSecond, a CD's interest rate is locked. Since the bank or credit union cannot change your interest rate, you know exactly how much money you'll earn on your deposit with no surprises. And because this is a bank deposit that earns interest, you cannot lose value like a stock can in a market downturn.\nWhen Should You Get a 6-Month CD?\nCDs tend to offer higher yields than traditional savings and money market accounts, especially in a low-interest rate environment. A 6-month CD may be a good option if you know that you won't need access to your funds for at least six to nine months. That includes people saving for a down payment on a home or setting aside funds for a big trip.\nLike savings accounts, almost all CDs are FDIC- or NCUA-insured. So you can't lose your principal at one of these institutions as long as your deposit doesn't exceed $250,000. In contrast, investing in stocks and even corporate bonds can be risky in that short of a time window. Should they lose value over a six-month stretch, you'll have to incur a loss.\nChoosing a CD over a savings or money market account is also a good idea if you're worried you'll be tempted to spend some of your savings, rather than keep it in the bank, since CDs require you to keep your funds in the CD until maturity.\nWhat Happens If You Take Your Money Out Early?\nMost financial institutions will deduct some of the interest that's accrued in your account if you withdraw funds from a CD before the maturity date. Losing three, or even six, months' worth of interest is fairly typical in the case of a 6-month CD, so there's a strong incentive to leave your money untouched until the certificate reaches maturity.\nSome places offer \"no-penalty\" CDs, but there's a rub: They tend to offer lower yields than standard CDs. What's more, they often require that you pull out the entire balance and close the account if you make an early withdrawal.\nAll banks and credit unions charge an early withdrawal penalty if you opt to withdraw CD funds before maturity. But the penalties vary widely, so it's important to investigate whether an institution's penalty policy is mild, reasonable, or onerous before you commit.\nCan I Lose Money on a 6-Month CD?\nSince you can't lose money on a CD due to bank failure (unless you have more than $250,000 on deposit at a single institution), CDs are exceptionally safe. There is, however, one scenario in which you could lose some of the principal of your initial deposit, but it's fortunately preventable by doing your homework.\nMost bank and credit union policies on early withdrawal penalties will only reduce the interest earnings on your CD. But a small number of institutions have such harsh penalty calculations that the penalty can actually deduct from your principal. These CDs are to be avoided, as you never know if an emergency will require you to cash out your CD early.\nHow Do You Use a 6-Month CD in a CD Ladder?\nA CD ladder is an investing strategy that allows you to leverage high CD rates while maintaining ready access to your money, without paying early withdrawal fees. You divide the total amount of money you want to invest, and invest those amounts in individual CDs with different maturity dates. When a CD matures, you reinvest that money into a new CD. A 6-month CD can be used with a CD ladder in any way, depending on your needs; it could be the shortest-term account, the longest-term account, or somewhere in the middle.\nWhy Don't I See Any Bank Names I Recognize in Your Ranking?\nThe country's largest banks are often the worst payers when it comes to savings and CD interest rates. In fact, some of the biggest players pay essentially zero interest. The key is to shop around, and to be open to holding some of your savings at a different institution than where you do your primary banking. Electronic transfers between banks are very easy with online banking, so you can easily keep your checking account and a small reserve account at your primary bank, but then sock away much of your savings in a CD at another institution.\nOur rankings of the best CD rates will always list the best nationwide rates available that day, regardless of which institutions are advertisers or sponsors on our site.\nFinancial Institutions We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed over 250 banks, credit unions, and financial institutions to find the best CD rates you see above on this list.

Taxes on the Money in My CD?\nYou do not need to pay taxes on the money you deposit into a CD. However, the money you earn in interest is taxable if it's more than $10. The tax you pay will depend on your tax bracket, and the tax can eat into some of your earnings. Be prepared to file a statement of interest earnings with the rest of your documents come tax season.8\nHow We Pick the Best 6-Month CDs\nEvery business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000. \nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

  "text": "10 Investing Concepts Beginners Need to Learn\nGetting started as an investor can be a daunting task. According to the 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey, 57% U.S. adults are invested, but just one in three say they have advanced investing knowledge. Getting started can be especially daunting if you are a methodical person who is cautious about commencing such an important undertaking before you have acquired sufficient knowledge, expertise, and confidence. \nMeanwhile, creating a short list of everything that a beginning investor should know inevitably runs the risk of excluding many vital points. Indeed, successful investors are bound to differ widely on what they would include in their top ten lists if they were pressed to replicate this exercise. \nThat said, we offer what we hope is a useful checklist to help you get started as a successful investor. We have chosen to emphasize key personal attitudes and overarching strategic frameworks that, in our opinion, will help you to become an intelligent investor. \nKey Takeaways\nHave a plan, prioritize saving, and know the power of compounding.\nUnderstand risk, diversification, and asset allocation.\nMinimize investment costs.\nLearn classic strategies, be disciplined, and think like an owner or lender.\nNever invest in something you do not fully understand.\nSubscribe Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PlayerFM \n1. Have a Financial Plan \nThe first step toward becoming a successful investor should be starting with a financial plan—one that includes goals and milestones. These goals and milestones would include setting targets for having specific amounts saved by specific dates. \nThe goals in question might include, for example, having enough savings to facilitate buying a home, funding your children's education, building an emergency fund, having enough to fund an entrepreneurial venture, or having enough to fund a comfortable retirement. \nMoreover, while most people think in terms of saving for retirement, an even more desirable goal would be to achieve financial independence at as early an age as possible. A movement devoted to this goal is Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). \nWhile it is possible to create a solid financial plan on your own, if you are new to the process, you might consider enlisting professional help from someone such as a financial advisor or financial planner, preferably one who is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®). Finally, do not delay. Seek to have a plan in place as early as possible in your lifetime, and keep it a living document, updated regularly and in light of changed circumstances and goals.\nThe FIRE Movement\nThe FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement argues for rapid wealth accumulation far in advance of the traditional retirement age to give you more options in life, earlier on.\n2. Make Saving a Priority \nBefore you can become an investor, you must have money to invest. For most people, that will require setting aside a portion of each paycheck for savings. If your employer offers a savings plan such as a 401(k), this can be an attractive way to make saving automatic, especially if your employer will match all or part of your own contributions. \nIn setting up your financial plan, you also might consider other alternatives for making saving automatic, in addition to utilizing employer-sponsored plans. Building wealth typically has aggressive saving at its core, followed by astute investing aimed at making those savings grow. \nAlso, a key to saving aggressively is living frugally and spending with caution. In this vein, a wise adjunct to your financial plan would be creating a budget, tracking your spending closely, and regularly reviewing whether your outlays are making sense and delivering sufficient value. Various budgeting apps and budgeting software packages are available, or you can choose to create your own spreadsheets. \n3. Understand the Power of Compounding \nSaving and investing on a regular, systematic basis and starting this discipline as early as possible in life will allow you to take full advantage of the power of compounding to increase your wealth. The current protracted period of historically low interest rates has diminished the power of compounding to some extent, but it also has made starting early to build savings and wealth more imperative, since it will take interest-bearing and dividend-paying investments longer to double in value than before, all else equal.1 \n4. Understand Risk \nInvestment risk has many aspects, such as default risk on a bond (the risk that the issuer may not meet its obligations to pay interest or repay principal) and volatility in stocks (which can produce sharp, sudden increases or decreases in value). Additionally, there is, in general, a tradeoff between risk and return, or between risk and reward. That is, the route to achieving higher returns on your investments often involves assuming more risk, including the risk of losing all or part of your investment. \nAs a critical part of your planning process, you should determine your own risk tolerance. How much you can be prepared to lose should a prospective investment decline in value, and how much ongoing price volatility in your investments you can accept without inducing undue worry, will be important considerations in determining what sorts of investments are most appropriate for you. \nRisk\nAt its most basic level, investment risk includes the possibility of a complete loss. But there are many other aspects to risk and its measurement.\n5. Understand Diversification and Asset Allocation \nDiversification and asset allocation are two closely related concepts that play important roles both in managing investment risk and in optimizing investment returns. Broadly speaking, diversification involves spreading your investment portfolio among a variety of investments, in hopes that subpar returns or losses in some may be offset by above average returns or gains in others. Likewise, asset allocation has similar goals, but with the focus being on distributing your portfolio across major categories of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. \nOnce again, your ongoing financial planning process should revisit your decisions on diversification and asset allocation regularly. \n6. Keep Costs Low \nYou cannot control the future returns on your investments, but you can control the costs. Moreover, costs (e.g., transaction costs, investment management fees, account fees, etc.) can be a significant drag on investment performance. Similarly, taking mutual funds as just one example, high cost is no guarantee of better performance. \nThe Importance of Costs\nInvestment costs and fees are often a key determinant of investment results.\n7. Understand Classic Investment Strategies \nAmong the investment strategies that the beginning investor should understand fully are active versus passive investing, value versus growth investing, and income-oriented versus gains-oriented investing. \nWhile savvy investment managers can beat the market, very few do it consistently over the long term. This leads some investment pundits to recommend low-cost passive investing strategies, mainly those utilizing index funds, that seek to track the market. \nIn the realm of equity investing, value investors prefer stocks that appear to be relatively inexpensive compared to the market on measures such as price-earnings ratios (P/E), expecting that these stocks have upside potential as well as limited downside risk. Growth investors, by contrast, see greater opportunity for gain among stocks that are recording rapid increases in revenues and earnings, even if they are relatively expensive. \nIncome-oriented investors seek a steady stream of dividends and interest because they need the ongoing spendable cash, they see this as a strategy that limits investment risk, or both. Among the variations of income-oriented investing is focusing on stocks that offer dividend growth. \nGains-oriented investors are largely unconcerned about income streams from their investments and instead look for the investments that seem likely to deliver the most price appreciation in the long term. \n8. Be Disciplined \nIf you are investing for the long term, according to a well-thought and well-constructed financial plan, stay disciplined. Try not to get excited or rattled by temporary market fluctuations and panic-inducing media coverage of the markets that might border on the sensationalistic. Also, always take the pronouncements of market pundits with a grain of salt unless they have lengthy, independently verified track records of predictive accuracy. Few do. \n9. Think Like an Owner or Lender \nStocks are shares of ownership in a business enterprise. Bonds represent loans extended by the investor to the issuer. If you intend to be an intelligent long-term investor rather than a short-term speculator, think like a prospective business owner before you buy a stock, or like a prospective lender before you buy a bond. Do you want to be a part owner of that business, or a creditor of that issuer? \n10. If You Don’t Understand It, Don’t Invest in It \nGiven the proliferation of complex and novel investment products, as well as of companies with complex and novel business models, beginning investors today are faced with a vast array of investment choice that they may not fully understand. A simple and wise rule of thumb is never to make an investment that you do not fully understand, particularly when it comes to its risks. A corollary is to be very careful about avoiding investing fads, many of which may not stand the test of time. \nAvoid the Unknown\nAvoid investments you don't fully understand. They may present large hidden dangers.\nWhat Do I Need to Know Before Investing?\nBefore investing, it is critical to know what your goals and objectives are. Whether it be to fund retirement, purchase a home, or undertake a new business venture, knowing what you're working towards will help you choose an investment to help you meet your goals. It is also important to know the basics about investing—such as risks, fees and costs, and investment strategies—and understand the investment you're prospecting.\nWhat Are the 4 Main Types of Investments?\nWhile there are many investment categories, the four basic types are stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. Bonds are essentially loans made by the investor to the issuer, who promises to pay the principal at maturity and interest over the bond's term. Mutual funds are funds in which multiple investors pool their money together to purchase stocks or other securities, and ETFs are like mutual funds but are traded on national stock exchanges.\nIs $100 Enough to Start Investing?\nMany prospective investors believe they must have a lot of money to begin investing. However, many investments have low thresholds, giving new investors opportunities to start their journey. You can begin investing with $100 or less. For instance, you could purchase shares or fractional shares of stock, use a robo-advisor to invest based on your goals, contribute to a retirement plan, or invest in a mutual fund. The options are plenty.\nThe Bottom Line \nAs a new investor, choosing the right investments or investment strategy can be intimidating, and the advice on how to proceed is as diverse as the selection of investments from which to choose. Despite the innumerous recommendations, building your knowledge and having a solid understanding of investing and your goals is key to making informed decisions that will likely yield favorable results.\nAddendum: A Classic Reading \nIf there is one book you should read as a new investor, it is Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay. Written in 1841 by a Scottish journalist, it is a masterful early study of crowd psychology. The first three chapters, \"The Mississippi Scheme,\" \"The South-Sea Bubble,\" and \"The Tulipomania,\" all deal with financial crazes that ended up in disaster and that foreshadow many financial schemes, bubbles, and manias of today. As a result, these chapters have been cited by a number of present-day financial writers.2",

  "text": "A Beginner’s Guide to Asset Classes\nThe investment landscape can be extremely dynamic and ever-evolving. But those who take the time to understand the basic principles and the different asset classes stand to gain significantly over the long haul. \nThe first step is learning to distinguish different types of investments and what rung each occupies on the risk ladder. \nKey Takeaways\nInvesting can be a daunting prospect for beginners, with an enormous variety of possible assets to add to a portfolio.\nThe investment risk ladder identifies asset classes based on their relative riskiness, with cash being the most stable and alternative investments often being the most volatile.\nSticking with index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the market is often the best path for a new investor.\nStocks tend to have higher yields than bonds, but also greater risks. \nMany investment specialists recommend diversifying one's portfolio.\nUnderstanding the Investment Risk Ladder \nInvestopedia / Joules Garcia\nHere are the major asset classes, in ascending order of risk, on the investment risk ladder. \nCash \nA cash bank deposit is the simplest, most easily understandable investment asset—and the safest. It not only gives investors precise knowledge of the interest that they’ll earn but also guarantees that they’ll get their capital back. \nOn the downside, the interest earned from cash socked away in a savings account seldom beats inflation. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are less liquid instruments, but they typically provide higher interest rates than those in savings accounts. However, the money put into a CD is locked up for a period of time (months to years), and there are potentially early withdrawal penalties involved.1 \nBonds \nA bond is a debt instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower. A typical bond will involve either a corporation or a government agency, where the borrower will issue a fixed interest rate to the lender in exchange for using their capital. Bonds are commonplace in organizations that use them to finance operations, purchases, or other projects.2 \nBond rates are essentially determined by interest rates. Due to this, they are heavily traded during periods of quantitative easing or when the Federal Reserve—or other central banks—raise interest rates.3 \nMutual Funds \nA mutual fund is a type of investment where more than one investor pools their money together to purchase securities. Mutual funds are not necessarily passive, as they are managed by portfolio managers who allocate and distribute the pooled investment into stocks, bonds, and other securities.4 Most mutual funds have a minimum investment of between $500 and $5,000, and many do not have any minimum at all. Even a relatively small investment provides exposure to as many as 100 different stocks contained within a given fund's portfolio. \nMutual funds are sometimes designed to mimic underlying indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. There are also many mutual funds that are actively managed, meaning that they are updated by portfolio managers who carefully track and adjust their allocations within the fund. However, these funds generally have greater costs—such as yearly management fees and front-end charges—that can cut into an investor’s returns.5 \nMutual funds are valued at the end of the trading day, and all buy and sell transactions are likewise executed after the market closes.6 \nMany investment specialists advise their clients to diversity into a wide range of securities rather than focusing on just a few stocks.\nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) \nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become quite popular since their introduction back in the mid-1990s. ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they trade throughout the day, on a stock exchange. In this way, they mirror the buy-and-sell behavior of stocks. This also means that their value can change drastically during the course of a trading day.7 \nETFs can track an underlying index such as the S&P 500 or any other basket of stocks with which the ETF issuer wants to underline a specific ETF. This can include anything from emerging markets to commodities, individual business sectors such as biotechnology or agriculture, and more. Due to the ease of trading and broad coverage, ETFs are extremely popular with investors.8 \nStocks \nShares of stock let investors participate in a company’s success via increases in the stock’s price and through dividends. Shareholders have a claim on the company’s assets in the event of liquidation (that is, the company going bankrupt) but do not own the assets. \nHolders of common stock enjoy voting rights at shareholders’ meetings. Holders of preferred stock don’t have voting rights but do receive preference over common shareholders in terms of the dividend payments.9 \nSome investments, such as hedge funds, are only permitted to wealthy investors.\nAlternative Investments \nThere is a vast universe of alternative investments, including the following sectors: \nReal estate: Investors can acquire real estate by directly buying commercial or residential properties. Alternatively, they can purchase shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs act like mutual funds wherein a group of investors pool their money together to purchase properties. They trade like stocks on the same exchange.10\nHedge funds: Hedge funds may invest in a spectrum of assets designed to deliver beyond market returns, called “alpha.” However, performance is not guaranteed, and hedge funds can see incredible shifts in returns, sometimes underperforming the market by a significant margin.11 Typically only available to accredited investors, these vehicles often require high initial investments of $1 million or more. They also tend to impose net worth requirements. Hedge fund investments may tie up an investor’s money for substantial time periods.12\nPrivate equity fund: Private equity funds are pooled investment vehicles similar to mutual and hedge funds. A private equity firm, known as the \"adviser,\" pools money invested in the fund by multiple investors and then makes investments on behalf of the fund. Private equity funds often take a controlling interest in an operating company and engage in active management of the company in an effort to bolster its value. Other private equity fund strategies include targeting fast-growing companies or startups. Like a hedge fund, private equity firms tend to focus on long-term investment opportunities of 10 years or more.13\nCommodities: Commodities refer to tangible resources such as gold, silver, and crude oil, as well as agricultural products.14 There are multiple ways of accessing commodity investments. A commodity pool or \"managed futures fund\" is a private investment vehicle combining contributions from multiple investors to trade in the futures and commodities markets. A benefit of commodity pools is that an individual investor's risk is limited to her financial contribution to the fund. Some specialized ETFs are also designed to focus on commodities.\nHow to Invest Sensibly, Suitably, and Simply \nMany veteran investors diversify their portfolios using the asset classes listed above, with the mix reflecting their tolerance for risk. A good piece of advice to investors is to start with simple investments, then incrementally expand their portfolios. Specifically, mutual funds or ETFs are a good first step, before moving on to individual stocks, real estate, and other alternative investments. \nHowever, most people are too busy to worry about monitoring their portfolios daily. Therefore, sticking with index funds that mirror the market is a viable solution. Steven Goldberg, a principal at the firm Tweddell Goldberg Wealth Management and longtime mutual funds columnist at Kiplinger.com, further argues that most individuals only need three index funds: one covering the U.S. equity market, another focused on international equities, and the third tracking a broad bond index.15 \nMore hands-on investors, however, may want to choose their own asset mix when crafting a diversified portfolio that fits their risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. This means that you can try to capture excess returns by tilting your portfolio weights to favor certain asset classes depending on the economic environment. \nAsset Class Expectations Given the Economic Environment \nLet's first consider the relative performance of stocks and bonds, which historically have shown somewhat of an inverse correlation: \nWhen the economy is strong and growing, with low unemployment, stocks tend to perform well as consumers spend and corporate profits rise. At the same time, bonds may underperform as interest rates rise to keep track with economic growth and inflation. When inflation is high, fixed-rate bonds may also fare comparatively worse if the coupon rate is below the rate of inflation.\nWhen the economy is turning sour and recession hits, unemployment rises and people stop spending as much, hurting corporate profits. This, in turn, can weigh down on stock prices. But, as interest rates fall in response to a sagging economy, bonds may outperform.\nMost financial professionals recommend a portfolio mix consisting of stocks and bonds, as described above. Other asset classes, too, may favor certain economic conditions; however, not all asset classes are suitable for investors. \nReal estate: A strong economy and low unemployment can lead to a robust housing market, which may benefit real estate investments. However, rising interest rates can put a damper on mortgage borrowing.\nCommodities: Inflationary environments can lead to an increase in the prices of certain commodities, making them a favorable asset class to use as an inflation hedge.\nAlternative investments: Private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, and other non-traditional investments may outperform in an environment of low interest rates and high liquidity. These types of investments, though, are not always available to individual investors and may require a significant outlay of cash and feature lower levels of liquidity.\nGold: Gold is considered as a safe haven asset and it performs well in times of economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and during inflationary environment. This was especially the case during the COVID19 pandemic, which saw gold rise to all-time highs during the Spring of 2020.\nCash and cash equivalents, (e.g. money market funds and CDs): These also tend to perform relatively well in uncertain or volatile economic environments is because they, too, are considered to be a safe haven. Investors may turn to cash as a way to preserve their capital and limit downside exposure to risk during bear markets. However, in a stable and low-inflation environment, cash will not usually provide returns as high as other asset classes such as stocks or bonds - but the stability and the low risk make a small allocation to cash an attractive option for investors seeking preservation of capital or for short term liquidity needs.\nWhat Are the Different Asset Classes?\nHistorically, the three main asset classes are considered to be equities (stocks), debt (bonds), and money market instruments. Today, many investors may consider real estate, commodities, futures, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies to be separate asset classes.\nWhich Asset Classes Are the Least Liquid?\nGenerally, land and real estate are considered among the least liquid assets, because it can take a long time to buy or sell a property at market price. Money market instruments are the most liquid, because they can easily be sold for their full value.\nWhat Asset Classes Do Well During High Inflation?\nReal estate and commodities are considered to be good inflation hedges, because their value tends to rise as prices increase. In addition, some government bonds are also indexed to inflation, making them an attractive way to store excess cash.\nThe Bottom Line \nInvestment education is essential—as is avoiding investments that you don’t fully understand. Rely on sound recommendations from experienced investors, while dismissing “hot tips” from untrustworthy sources. When consulting professionals, look to independent financial advisors who get paid only for their time, instead of those who collect commissions. And above all, diversify your holdings across a wide swath of assets.",

  "text": "How to Start Investing in Stocks in 2024\nInvesting in stocks can be a powerful way to grow your wealth over time. It involves buying shares in a company with the hope that the company will grow and perform well in the stock market over time, resulting in gains on your investment. \nIt's important to start by setting clear investment goals, determining how much you can invest and how much risk you can tolerate. Then pick a broker that matches your trading style, fund your account, and buy stocks. \nThis beginner’s guide explains the essential steps to invest in stocks, whether you have thousands set aside or can invest a more modest $25 a week.\nKey Takeaways\nInvesting in stocks and letting your money work for you is one way to grow your wealth.\nInvesting involves a chance of losses. However, there are ways to lower your risk, though you can't eliminate it altogether.\nNew investors have never had so many resources for expert advice.\nFollowing these seven essential steps, you’ll learn how to set clear investment goals, choose the right stocks, and understand the basics of stock investing.\nHow to Invest in Stocks: A 7-Step Guide \nInvesting in stocks involves purchasing shares of ownership in a public company in the hopes of seeing the company perform well in the stock market, leading to a share price increase that makes your investment more valuable. \nInvesting in stocks can lead to positive financial returns if you own a stock that grows in value over time. But you also face the risk of losing money if a share price falls over time. \nStep 1: Set Clear Investment Goals \nBegin by specifying your financial objectives. Clear goals will guide your investment decisions and help you stay focused. Consider both short-term and long-term goals, as they will affect your investment strategy. \nYou might have short-term goals like saving for a home or a vacation or have long-term objectives like securing a comfortable retirement or funding a child’s education. Your objectives depend on your life stage and ambitions. Younger investors tend to focus more on growth and long-term wealth accumulation, while those closer to retirement typically prefer generating income and capital preservation. The more precise you are, the better. \nTips for Setting Investment Goals: \nBe precise about your objectives: Instead of vague goals like “save for retirement,” aim for specific targets like “accumulate $500,000 in my retirement fund by age 50.”\nDetermine your investment horizon: Assess how long you have to achieve each goal. Longer time horizons often allow for more aggressive investment strategies, while shorter ones may require more conservative approaches. The longer you give yourself, the less conservative you'll need to be early on.\nEvaluate your finances: Be realistic about how much you can put toward your investment goals, considering your savings, regular income, and any other financial resources. \nRank your goals: Most of us balance several goals at once, and we have to prioritize saving for a home down payment, paying for a wedding next year, or preparing for retirement based on urgency and importance. For example, saving for a down payment on a house might take precedence over planning a vacation.\nAdapt as life changes: The phrase financial planning is best taken as a verb, not a noun. It's an ongoing process that should evolve with your needs and aspirations. You might fall in love or out of it, have many children or none of them, or realize your life’s work means moving cross country. Regularly review and adjust your goals as your life circumstances change.\nThe first step in any venture is the biggest, but by setting clear and precise investment goals, you'll lay a strong foundation for building your investments. This clarity will help you navigate the stock market with confidence and purpose. \nStep 2: Determine How Much You Can Afford To Invest \nPinpointing how much you can afford to put in stocks requires a clear-eyed assessment of your finances. This step helps ensure that you are investing responsibly without endangering your financial stability.\nTips for Determining Your Investment Amount: \nReview your income sources: Begin by listing all your sources of income. Check if your employer offers investment options with tax benefits or matching funds to amplify your investments.\nEstablish an emergency fund: Ensure you have a solid financial foundation before investing. Solid does not mean perfect. This fund should cover a few months' worth of major expenses, such as mortgage or rent payments and other essential bills.\nPay off high-interest debts: Financial planners typically recommend paying down high-interest debts, such as credit card balances. The returns from investing in stocks are unlikely to outweigh the costs of high interest accumulating on these debts. Thus, scrutinize each of your debts similarly, weighing the interest payments against potential investment returns. Likely, your debts will have to come first.\nCreate a budget: Based on your financial assessment, decide how much money you can comfortably invest in stocks. You also want to know if you're starting with a lump sum or smaller amounts put in over time. Your budget should ensure that you are not dipping into funds you need for expenses.\nDon't worry if your funds are less than you would wish. You wouldn't berate yourself for not being ready for a race on your first day of training; so, too, with investing. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and the journey is still ahead. \nTwo crucial points: \nOnly invest money you can afford to lose.\nNever put yourself in a financially vulnerable position for the sake of investing.\nTaking these seriously is what separates investing from gambling.\nStep 3: Determine Your Risk Tolerance and Investing Style \nUnderstanding your risk tolerance is a cornerstone of investing. It helps you align your comfort level with the inherent uncertainties of the stock market and financial goals. \nTips for Assessing Your Risk Tolerance \nSelf-assessment: Reflect on your comfort level with the ups and downs of the stock market. Are you willing to accept higher risks for potentially greater returns, or do you prefer stability even if that means potentially less in the end?\nConsider your time horizon: Your risk tolerance often depends on your investment timeline. Longer horizons allow for more risk since you have time to recover from potential losses. Shorter timelines typically require more conservative investments.\nGauge your financial cushion: Assess your finances, including your savings, emergency fund, and other investments. A solid financial cushion can help you take on more risk.\nAlign investments with risk levels: Choose stocks and other investments that align with your risk tolerance. Examples:\nLower risk: Dividend stocks and bonds.\nModerate risk: Midcap and large-capitalization stocks, index funds, and exchange-traded funds.\nHigh risk: Small-cap stocks, growth stocks, and sector-specific investments.\nAdjust over time: Your risk tolerance may change as your finances and goals evolve. Regularly reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nBy accurately determining your risk tolerance, you can build a portfolio that reflects your financial goals and personal comfort level, helping you navigate the stock market with more peace of mind.\nTips for Identifying Your Investing Style: \nWhether you prefer a hands-on approach or a more passive strategy, understanding your investing style helps you choose the right investment methods and tools. Everyone has a different relationship with money. Some prefer an active role, meticulously pouring over every last cell on their portfolio's spreadsheets, while others opt for a set-it-and-forget-it approach. They trust their investments will grow over time if they just leave them alone. \nYour style might evolve, but you'll need to start somewhere, even if your choice isn't set in stone. \nBegin with a self-reflection on whether you enjoy researching and analyzing stocks or prefer a more detached approach. Here are your main choices:\n1. DIY investing: If you grasp how stocks work and have the confidence to head out with minimal guidance into the market, managing the trades yourself is one option. Even DIY, there are more and less active approaches: \nActive: You use your brokerage account to access various investments, including stocks, bonds, and other assets, and trade as you wish. You'll set your goals and choose when to buy and sell.\nPassive: You use your brokerage account to buy shares in index ETFs and mutual funds. You still control which funds you purchase, but fund managers do the trading for you.\n2. Professional guidance: For those who prefer a more personal approach and want more, an experienced broker or financial advisor is often invaluable. These financial professionals tailor their advice to your life experiences and goals, help you decide among the most promising stock choices, monitor your portfolio, and collaborate with you when things need changing. \nStep 4. Choose an Investment Account \nYou've figured out your goals, the risk you can tolerate, and how active an investor you want to be. Now, it's time to choose the type of account you'll use. Each has its own features, benefits, and drawbacks. In addition, the type of account you choose can greatly impact your tax situation, investment options, and overall strategy. You'll need to compare different brokers to find the investment account right for you. \nTips for Choosing Your Investment Account \n1. Understand the different account types: In the table below, we've listed the differences between regular brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and managed accounts. You'll want to choose one that'll work for you. We also list special accounts for education and health savings. \n2. Consider the tax implications: \nTaxable accounts: These are the most common if you're trading online. Brokerage accounts don’t offer tax benefits, but there are no restrictions on contributions or withdrawals.\nTax-deferred accounts: Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s cut taxable income, and taxes are deferred until you withdraw the money.\nTax-free accounts: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are funded with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.\n3. Evaluate your investment goals: Match your investment account type with your goals. For long-term retirement savings, consider tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals or flexible investing, a standard brokerage account might be better. \n4. Scrutinize account fees, commissions, and minimums: \nTrading commissions: These are fees brokers charge when you buy or sell securities. Many brokers now offer commission-free trades for particular investments, such as stocks and ETFs.\nAccount maintenance fees: Some brokerage accounts may charge annual or monthly maintenance fees, which depend on the account type and balance.\nInactivity fees: Brokers may charge fees if your account has little or no trading activity over a certain period.\nSubscription-based models: As Generation Zers and Millennials take up a larger share of the investment space, financial advisors, planners, and brokers are adjusting. Instead of paying per transaction or for specific services, you pay a flat monthly or annual fee. Your subscription may include commission-free trades, access to research tools, and other premium support.3\nAccount minimums: Momentous changes in recent years have resulted from immense competition among brokerages. Many online brokers have eliminated account minimums, making it easier for more investors to get started.4 If you have just a few dollars to invest, you can open a brokerage account and begin trading stocks.\n5. Check for added features: Some accounts offer additional features such as automatic contributions, access to financial advisors, educational resources, and more. Select an account that provides the features that fit your preferences. \nResearch and analysis: Choose a broker with robust research tools, market analysis, and educational resources to help you make informed decisions.\nUser-friendly trading platform: It shouldn't be glitchy or too difficult for you to use. It's best if it has real-time quotes, sophisticated charting tools, and mobile access.\nCustomer service: Look for brokers that offer several customer support options, including phone, email, live chat, and in-person support if needed.\nReputation and security: Avoid any platform that is not regulated by authorities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, check that the broker employs strong security measures, such as encryption and two-factor authentication, to protect your personal and financial information.\n6. Pick your broker: Brokers are full-service, discount, or robo-advisory. A good broker will offer the tools, resources, and support you need to make informed investment decisions and manage your portfolio effectively. \nFull-service brokers: These pack an array of financial services into one offering, including financial advice for retirement, healthcare, and educational products. They might craft financial plans to help you save for college, prepare for retirement, navigate estate transitions, and tackle other major life events. This personalized service explains their typically higher fees—usually a percentage of your transaction values and assets under management. Some firms bill a yearly membership fee. To access these services, you'll typically need to invest at least $25,000, and they have traditionally catered to high-net-worth individuals.\nDiscount brokers: These have much lower, if any, thresholds for access but have a typically more streamlined service that allows you to place individual trades (often for low or no commissions per trade). Most have educational materials on their sites and mobile apps. However, they may have other requirements and fees. Be sure to check on both and review our Best Online Brokers for Beginners of 2024.\nRobo-advisors: For an automated solution, robo-advisors save money and take little effort on your part. If you select one, you won't be alone. According to Charles Schwab, 58% of Americans say they will use some sort of robo-advisor by 2025.5 They tend to offer fewer trading options and lack the personal approach to financial planning that's often best for long-term investing. Want to know more? See our Best Robo-Advisors of 2024.\nStep 5: Fund Your Stock Account \nBy this step, you've picked a broker that aligns with your investment goals and preferences or is simply the most convenient. You've also decided whether you're opening a cash account, which requires you to pay for investments in full, or a margin account, which lets you borrow when purchasing securities. \nOnce you've chosen a brokerage and account type, you'll open your account. This involves providing your personal information: Social Security number, address, employment details, and financial data. This shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes. \nNow you'll have to fund it. Here are tips for doing so: \nTips for Funding Your Stock Account \n1. Choose how you'll fund it: \nBank transfer: The most common method is to transfer funds directly from your bank account. This can be done via electronic funds transfer or wire transfer.\nCheck deposit: Some brokers allow you to mail a check to fund your account. This method can take longer but is viable if you prefer not to use electronic transfers.\nTransfer from another brokerage: If you have an existing brokerage account, you can transfer assets directly to your new account. This process, known as an ACATS transfer, is usually straightforward but may take a few days to complete.\n2. Set up automatic contributions: Dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals over time, no matter what the market does. This cuts your risk of making bad decisions based on short-term market news. Most brokers let you customize the frequency and amount of your automatic contributions, making it easier to stay within your budget and keep on track with your investment goals. \n3. Start investing: Once you've verified the funds are in your account (don't worry: the brokerage won't let you trade otherwise), it's time to start choosing the stocks that best fit your investment goals. \nIf you plan to trade frequently, check out our list of brokers for cost-conscious traders.\nStep 6: Pick Your Stocks \nEven experienced investors grapple with choosing the best stocks. Beginners should look for stability, a strong track record, and the potential for steady growth. Resist the temptation to gamble on risky stocks, hoping for a quick windfall. Long-term investing is mostly slow and steady, not fast and rash. \nHere are the types of stocks more likely to be solid bets when starting off: \nBlue chips: These are shares of large, well-established, and financially sound companies with a history of reliable performance. Examples include companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. They are typically industry leaders and offer stability during market fluctuations.\nDividend stocks: Companies that regularly pay dividends can be a good choice for beginners. Dividends give you a regular income, which can be reinvested to buy even more stock. See How to Buy Dividend Stocks to learn more.\nGrowth stocks: The greater the chances for outsized growth in a stock, the riskier investing in it will be. Beginners interested in growth stocks should target industries with long-term potential, such as technology or healthcare.\nDefensive stocks: These are in industries that tend to do well even during economic downturns, such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer goods. They will give you a buffer against market volatility as you start.\nETFs: Traded like stocks, these track market indexes like the S&P 500, and offer instant diversification, reducing the risk associated with individual stocks. As you gain experience, you can look at funds for sectors that pique your interest, themes that meet your investment goals, or funds pooling environmental, social, and governance stocks.\nIt's prudent to begin with a conservative approach, focusing on stocks or funds that offer stability and a good track record. This will give you confidence and returns to trade with as you advance in your investing knowledge.\nStep 7. Learn, Monitor, Review \nSuccessful investors discover tips and strategies each passing day. As the stock market changes, staying up to date, going back to Step 1, reviewing your goals, etc., will be key. Here are tips on learning about, monitoring, and reviewing your accounts with an eye toward your goals and risk tolerance. \nTips for Learning and Monitoring Your Stocks \nRead widely and regularly: Read reputable financial news sites. Keep informed about the global economy, industry trends, and the companies you are invested in. Avoid sites and books promising easy returns or tricks, not tips, likely to redound to their benefit when you buy their courses or apps. Books on investment strategies, stock market fundamentals, and diversification are essential.\nUse stock simulators: These are platforms that enable you to practice trading stocks risk-free using virtual money. They are excellent for applying investment theories and testing strategies without risk. Investopedia's simulator is entirely free to use.\nLearn about diversification: Having taken your beginning steps here, you'll next want to spread your investments across diverse asset classes to cut down on risk and improve your potential for returns. When you're ready, we can help you learn how to diversify your portfolio beyond stocks.\nYou now need to monitor your stocks and other investments. Regular reviewing and staying informed will help you adjust when necessary to keep on track with your financial goals.\nBest Investments and Stocks for Beginners to Buy \nPicking the right stocks can overwhelm those starting to navigate the investing world—you're starting with a blank slate, and the options are endless. Here are ideas that aren't only the best for beginners but are many times the choice of the experts managing their own portfolios: \nIndex funds: These are not technically stocks but funds that trade shares like them. They are passively managed funds that track the performance of a particular market index, like the S&P 500, a collection of 500 major publicly traded American companies. \nThese might not come with the excitement of picking a stock and seeing it take off, but index funds take what would be impractical or too expensive for a beginner and let you invest in a whole pool of them. And they do well: According to the S&P Indices Versus Active score cards, a widely respected benchmark, about 90% of actively managed funds didn't match the returns of the S&P 500 over 10 and 15-year periods.6 This is simple but winning information: the most effortless route might be the most profitable. \nBlue chip stocks: Classic investing advice has been to buy shares of well-established, stable companies with a history of consistent growth and dividend payments. The blue chips—named for the traditional color of the highest-value poker chips—have strong brand recognition, a solid market position, and a track record of weathering economic downturns. Investing in them can provide you with stability and the potential for steady, long-term returns. \nExamples include Apple (AAPL), known for its ubiquitous technology products and loyal customer base; JP Morgan & Chase Co (JPM), the banking giant; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a healthcare giant that also owns manufacturers of many consumer goods; and Coca-Cola (KO), the soft drink maker that has distributed dividends each year since 1893. \nDividend aristocrats: Coca-Cola is not just a blue-chip stock but also belongs to a select group that has distributed and increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. By investing in dividend aristocrats, beginners can benefit from the potential for rising income and the chance to reinvest the dividends for compound growth. \nExamples include ExxonMobil (XOM), one of the world's largest oil and gas companies with a history of solid cash generation; Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the consumer products multinational; and Walmart (WMT), the retail behemoth. \nLow-volatility stocks: These companies' shares have historically had fewer price swings, providing more solidity to portfolios and, not for nothing, calm for investor heart rates. They often belong to \"defensive sectors\" (recession-proof parts of the economy) such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. \nExamples include companies we've mentioned already (Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, etc.), as well as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Brystol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY), Duke Energy (DUK), and the Hershey Company (HSY), whose stability even during financial storms shows that the love of chocolate doesn't go away when the economy hits some bumps. \nQuality factor ETFs: These invest in companies with solid balance sheets, consistent growth in earnings, and other measures of good financial health. Quality factor ETFs take a rules-based approach to selecting stocks with low debt levels, stable earnings, and high returns. \nExample funds include the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, which holds large- and midcap U.S. stocks with solid quality characteristics, and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF, which focuses on high-quality stocks within the S&P 500 index. \nThe potential drawback for each of these investments is that you might not see the outsized growth that riskier stocks could provide. In addition, past performance does not determine future results. If you have limited funds, this could be unappealing: more modest returns won't seem to add much when you don't have much to begin with. \nHowever, reinvested dividends and compound growth add up. Investing is not gambling, and the reason to invest rather than go to a casino is that prudent, patient, and disciplined investing is how most investors get ahead.\nHow Much Money Do I Need To Start Investing in Stocks?\nThe amount needed depends on the brokerage firm and the investments you're interested in. Some online brokerages have no minimum deposit requirements, allowing you to start investing with a small amount of money. However, the price of individual stocks and the minimum investment for certain mutual funds or ETFs might require you to start with more of an initial investment. That said, there are many brokerages and investment options now for those starting with less to invest than there were a decade or two ago.\nAre Stock Funds Good for Beginner Investors?\nStock funds, including mutual funds and ETFs that invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, are a good option for beginner investors. They offer diversification, which helps spread risk across different stocks, and are managed by professional fund managers. In addition, stock funds allow beginners to invest in a broad range of stocks with a single investment, making it easier to get started without having to pick individual stocks. While you watch your mutual fund or ETF investment over time, you will also gain experience about the ebb and flow of the stocks these funds hold, good knowledge that will help you when investing later.\nWhat Are the Risks of Investing?\nInvesting is a commitment of resources now toward a future financial goal. There are many levels of risk, with certain asset classes and investment products inherently much riskier than others. It is always possible that the value of your investment will not increase over time. For this reason, a key consideration for investors is how to manage their risk to achieve their financial goals, whether short- or long-term.\nDo I Have To Live in the U.S. To Open a Brokerage Account?\nTo open a brokerage account, you don't have to live in the U.S. Many U.S. brokerage firms accept international clients. However, the application process and requirements will differ, including the need for additional documentation, such as proof of identity and residence. There are also some investments and services regulations curtailed for those who aren't U.S. citizens, but the experience is very similar. Most major online brokerages in the U.S. accept international clients.\nHow Do Commissions and Fees Work?\nMost brokers charge customers a commission for every trade. Due to commission costs, investors generally find it prudent to limit the total number of trades they make to avoid spending extra money on fees. Certain other types of investments, such as exchange-traded funds, may carry additional fees to cover fund management costs.\nThe Bottom Line \nBeginners can start investing in stocks with a relatively small amount of money. You'll have to do your homework to determine your investment goals, risk tolerance, and the costs of investing in stocks and mutual funds. You'll also need to research brokers and their fees to find the one that best fits your investment style and goals. Once you do, you’ll be well-positioned to take advantage of the potential stocks have to reward you financially in the coming years.",

  "text": "What Are Stock Fundamentals?\nWhat Are Stock Fundamentals? \nStock fundamentals are key metrics for a company, such as cash flow and return on assets (ROA). Analysts often perform fundamental analysis to analyze a stock by looking at its fundamentals. This involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or perceived value of a stock. \nKey Takeaways\nFundamental analysis involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or perceived value of a stock.\nSome of the fundamentals of stocks include cash flow, return on assets, and conservative gearing.\nPerforming fundamental analysis can be challenging because it requires digging through financial statements to know when the stock price is wrong.\nHow Stock Fundamentals Work \nIn the broadest terms, fundamental analysis involves looking at any data which is expected to impact the price or perceived value of a stock. This is, of course, anything aside from the trading patterns of the stock itself, As the name implies, it means getting down to basics. \nFundamental analysis focuses on creating a portrait of a company, identifying the fundamental value of its shares, and buying or selling the stock based on that information. Some of the indicators commonly used to assess company fundamentals include:1 \nCash flow\nReturn on assets\nConservative gearing\nHistory of profit retention for funding future growth\nThe soundness of capital management for the maximization of shareholder earnings and returns\nFundamental analysts have a staid approach to analyzing stock performance. They look at a variety of factors that they believe influence a stock's performance. These include the industry as a whole, the competition, a company's management structure, its income and revenue, as well as its growth potential. \nExample of Stock Fundamentals \nAll of the data is public and readily available, generally through a company's financial statements. The goal is to ultimately identify which stocks are priced correctly—and incorrectly—by the market. \nTo help you visualize it, let's use the following analogy. Think of the stock market as a shopping mall, where stocks are the items for sale in the retail outlets. Their sights are set solely on the products in the mall. Shoppers are dismissed as an unreliable, emotional herd with no inkling of the real value of the goods for sale. \nFundamental analysts move slowly through the stores seeking the best deals. Once the crowd moves on from, say, the personal computers (PCs), they will take a closer look at the ones that were passed over. \nFundamental analysts may take a stab at determining the scrap value of the PC stripped down to its hard disk, memory cards, monitor, and keyboard. In the stock market, this is akin to calculating the book value, or liquidation price, of a company. \nThese analysts also take a very close look at the quality of the PC. Is it going to last or will it break down within a year? The fundamental analysts will pore over the specifications, scrutinize the manufacturer's warranty, and consult consumer reports. Similarly, equity analysts check a company's balance sheet for financial stability. \nThen, the fundamental analysts may try to understand the performance of the PC in terms of, say, processing power, memory, or image resolution. These are like the forecast earnings and dividends identified from a company's income statement. \nFinally, the fundamental analysts will put together all the data and come up with the intrinsic value, or value independent of the current sale price. If the sale price is less than the calculated intrinsic value, the fundamentalists will buy PCs. If not, they will either sell the PCs they already own or wait for prices to fall before buying more. \nSpecial Considerations \nPerforming fundamental analysis can be a lot of hard work. But that is, arguably, the source of its appeal. By taking the trouble to dig into a company's financial statements and assessing its future prospects, investors can learn enough to know when the stock price is wrong. \nThese conscientious investors are able to spot the market's mistakes and make themselves money. At the same time, buying companies based on intrinsic, long-term value protects investors from the dangers of day-to-day market fluctuations. \nHowever, the fact that fundamental analysis shows that a stock is undervalued does not guarantee it will trade at its intrinsic value any time soon. Things are not so simple. In reality, real share price behavior relentlessly calls into question almost every stock holding, and even the most independently-minded investor can start doubting the merits of fundamental analysis. There is no magic formula for figuring out intrinsic value. \nJust because fundamental analysis shows that a stock is undervalued doesn't guarantee it will trade at its intrinsic value in the near future.\nWhen the stock market is booming, it is easy for investors to fool themselves into thinking they have a knack for picking winners. But when the market falls and the outlook is uncertain, investors cannot rely on luck. They actually need to know what they're doing. \nFundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis \nFundamental analysis is much different from its cousin, technical analysis.2 Where fundamental analysis focuses on measuring a stock's intrinsic value, technical analysis concentrates solely on the trading and price history of a stock by looking at trading signals and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength or weakness of a stock. \nTechnical analysts believe that a stock's past performance—its price and trading activity—can help determine where it will go in the future. In essence, the theory of technical analysis is rooted in the fact that the movement in price is not random. Instead, it believes that patterns and trends are identifiable and repeat over time. \nTo demonstrate, let's go back to the analogy above. Technical analysts ignore the goods for sale. Instead, they keep an eye on the crowds as a guide for what to buy. So, if a technical analyst notices shoppers congregating inside a computer shop, they will try to buy as many PCs as possible, betting that the growing demand will push PC prices higher. \nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

  "text": "7 Ways to Invest $1,000\nInvesting is an incremental game, and building a solid portfolio takes time. Here are seven ways to invest $1,000 to help you get started. \nKey Takeaways\nPaying down debt or creating an emergency fund is a way to invest $1,000.\nInvesting $1,000 in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) allows investors to diversify and save on transaction costs.\nDebt instruments like bonds and Treasury bills are low-risk investments that may offer a steady yield.\nInvesting $1,000 in individual stocks is risky but offers potentially higher returns, especially over longer time horizons.\n1. Pay Down Debt \nPaying off debt ensures a guaranteed return. The interest you save is essentially a risk-free investment. Once debt-free, you will be able to target your $1,000 toward an emergency fund into an account that earns interest, such as a savings account or money market account. \n2. Invest in an ETF or Index Fund \nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds are a way to invest in the market with a small amount of money. These funds are transparent investments offered by financial institutions, and information is readily available for ETFs and index funds, including their holdings, commissions, and expense ratios. Pick the best broker for buying ETFs from our list of Best Brokers for ETFs. \nIndex funds are a passive, broad market investment through the major indexes, while ETFs offer more choices to customize a portfolio. With $1,000, you can choose multiple ETFs with different risk profiles. For example, you might invest $250 in a higher-risk, growth-oriented ETF, $250 into a dividend ETF, and $500 into a bond ETF. \n3. Use Target-Date Funds \nTarget-date funds offer similar diversity to ETFs, but they require less effort when choosing. A target-date fund may have a higher expense ratio than your basic ETF, but in return, the fund will allocate and rebalance the account for you over time based on the target date. \n4. Try a Robo-Advisor \nRobo-advisors like Betterment, Acorns, and AssetBuilder use artificial intelligence (AI) and offer active management at lower expense ratios than the prices of human fund managers.123 This has prompted traditional advisors like Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab to use AI for some of their offerings.45 \n5. Low-Risk Debt Instruments \nETFs, index funds, and mutual funds are commonly stock funds with higher risk and return profiles than investments in debt instruments. U.S. Treasuries and savings bonds may carry competitive yields comparable to funds but at a lower risk. \nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley expects inflation to be around 3.5% by the end of 2023, with Treasuries offering modest inflation-adjusted returns.6 Treasury bond income is also exempt from state and local taxes.7 \n6. Buy a Single Stock \nStock investment commonly requires a higher risk tolerance, but may garner higher potential returns for your $1,000. Over the last decade, an investment in Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), or Alphabet (GOOGL or GOOG) would have doubled or tripled $1,000. Stock investment requires research and timing. According to Morgan Stanley, stocks are priced to return 1.8% more than Treasuries in 2023, below the average spread of 3.5% over the last decade.6\n7. Trade Options and Forex \nOptions trading and foreign exchange (forex) trading are very high-risk investments and are commonly used by experienced investors. Options are a form of derivative contract that gives buyers of the contracts the right to buy or sell a security at a chosen price at some point in the future. The forex market is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies. Many traders lose more than $1,000 as they spend years learning this trading craft and making consistently profitable trades. \nWhat Is an Emergency Fund?\nAn emergency fund is the money set aside as a financial safety net for unexpected expenses. Emergency funds should typically have three to six months’ worth of expenses.\nHow Do I Balance My Portfolio?\nEach investor has different financial goals and objectives. It’s always advisable to pay down outstanding debt or build an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. If you plan on putting the money to work in the markets, consider spreading it across several different asset classes, such as stocks, ETFs, and bonds to start building a balanced and diverse portfolio.\nWhen Is the Best Time to Invest?\nHistory shows that time in the market rewards investors over the long term. Although there may be short-term fluctuations, stocks generally trend higher over time. Significant market downturns during the 2007–08 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic turned out to be buying opportunities for those prepared to wait patiently for returns. As investor Warren Buffett famously said, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.”89\nThe Bottom Line \nWith many available options, investors can use $1,000 to purchase ETFs, stocks, or bonds. Simply paying off outstanding debt may save money in interest payments over time and prove to be a wise investment. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "Best Investment Accounts for Young Investors\nWhat are the best investment accounts for young investors? Though encouraged to invest for their future, which is good advice, the big question for young investors is how to get started. The types of investment accounts to consider can be particularly confusing. \nTax-Deferred Accounts \nRetirement accounts can be tax-deferred. This means that the money invested in the account grows and compounds free of taxation year to year. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and company-sponsored retirement accounts, such as 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans, are examples of tax-deferred retirement accounts, meaning that the money is not taxed until it is withdrawn for retirement. Remember that the money has to be from employment. You can't invest other money you might have, from an inheritance perhaps, into a retirement account.1 \nIn many cases, there is a tax break upfront when the money is contributed to these accounts. Workplace retirement plans allow you to make contributions from each paycheck. The contribution amount is withdrawn, leaving less income to be taxed. \nIn the case of a traditional IRA, contributions are made in a similar fashion to a 401(k), with pre-tax dollars, and can be tax-deductible. An IRA or a 401(k) contribution might be one of the few tax breaks available for a younger worker, an added benefit for doing something you should do anyway.1 \nRoth Accounts \nA contribution to a Roth IRA is made with after-tax employment income—in other words, money on which you've already paid taxes. As with a traditional IRA or 401(k), the money grows free of taxes while invested. However, at retirement, the money can be withdrawn completely tax-free if certain rules are followed.2 \nNote that you can only open a Roth IRA account if your income is below a certain level.3 That makes these a good option for younger investors, as their income may be lower and the benefit of the current-year tax breaks is not as valuable as it will be down the road when their income rises. \nTaxable Accounts \nTaxable accounts can include brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit (CD), higher-interest depository accounts, and accounts with mutual fund companies. Gains and interest from these accounts are taxable each year as incurred. Losses can also be deducted in many cases.45 With a taxable account, you generally have greater access to your money without worrying about the taxes and potential penalties that can come with a tax-deferred or Roth account. \nWhere to Open an Account \nYour 401(k) plan will not offer you a choice of where to open an account and will come with a set investment menu through your employer. As for other types of accounts, you have a lot of choices. \nTaxable accounts and IRAs can be opened at many popular investment custodians, such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, and a host of others. Additionally, many mutual fund companies offer account options as well. Robo advisors such as Betterment, Ellevest, Titan, Acorns, SoFi, and Wealthfront are also an option. These technology-based advisors invest your money in low-cost investment options, such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), based on computer algorithms tied to your specific needs and goals. This can be a great option for someone just starting out, with little money to invest and with a preference for a mobile-based service with no human interaction. \nIn today’s online world there are many new types of accounts and account providers. There is even an app called Acorns that rounds up the amount from purchases from linked accounts and invests your “spare change.” Technology can enable many wonderful twists on basic savings and brokerage accounts, for example by using personal finance apps to manage your accounts. As with any type of financial account or transaction, be sure you understand how the account and its technology works, who is behind it, and if it is right for you. \nCDs and other vehicles for saving are available at banks and many brokerage firms. In fact, the lines separating traditional financial service providers are blurring as more firms attempt to offer a full range of accounts and services. \nThe Bottom Line \nInvesting is a lifelong activity, and getting started is sometimes the hardest part. Understanding the different types of accounts available to you is a good first step in this process. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "How to Buy Fractional Shares on Webull\nIf you are looking to start investing in the market but don’t feel like you have enough money to buy enough shares to fully diversify your portfolio, fractional shares are a great solution. This strategy allows you to invest in stocks based on a specific dollar amount rather than buying a specific number of shares. This allows you to diversify your funds and start investing at a lower threshold. Buying fractional shares on Webull’s platform is streamlined and easy. You simply open and fund an account to access fractional shares from an approved list of thousands of stocks and ETFs. We’ll take an in-depth look at how to buy fractional shares through Webull and cover the basics to help you decide if fractional share trading is the right fit for your portfolio needs. \nHow to Buy Fractional Shares on Webull \nBuying fractional shares on Webull is a very simple process. To open an account, you have to provide some basic personal information as well as details on your employment, financial status, and what type of securities you want to invest in. Once the application has been filled out, most investors will receive an email with account approval within minutes. Once the account has been approved, you merely need to fund the account and you will be ready to start investing. \nStep 1: Open a Webull account. Opening an account with Webull is straightforward.1 Users can sign up using their phone number and verification code, or sign up using their Facebook or Google profile. You will then have the option to select “open an account.” Next you will be asked to verify your identity by uploading a photo of your driver’s license or another form of identification. From there, you will enter in your basic personal information, employment information, financial information, and the type of account you want to open. Once all this is filled out, you will enter your email address for verification of account application approval. When you receive the email letting you know your account is approved, you are ready to fund your account and start investing. You can fund the account via an ACH transfer with a linked bank account using the “make your first deposit” button. \nIt is important to note that you can choose between a cash account and a margin account. With the cash account, you can purchase stocks with whatever funds you deposit. A margin account requires an account balance above $2,000 and unlocks the ability to use leverage beyond your balance to increase your buying power.2 \nStep 2: Log in to your Webull account. Once you have opened a Webull account, you can login and search for the stock or exchange traded fund (ETF) that you’d like to buy fractional shares of. If fractional share trading is available for that particular stock, there will be a green diamond icon on the stock.3 \nStep 3: Click the “Trade” tab. After deciding on the stock that you’d like to buy and determining that it can be traded in fractional shares, you will click the “trade” button at the bottom of your screen. From there, switch the order type to “market,” as fractional share trading at Webull can only take place currently as a market order during market hours.4 \nStep 4: Change setting from “Shares” to “Dollars.” You will then need to change the setting from “share” to “USD” in order to buy fractional shares. Enter the dollar amount that you’d like to invest and review all order information for accuracy.3 \nStep 5: Submit your order. Once you have verified your order information, click the “buy” button at the bottom of the screen to place your order. You will want to carefully review your order before clicking the “buy” button because once an order is placed, Webull does not have the option to modify an open order.4 \nCompare Some Top Online Brokers \nWhat You Need to Open a Webull Brokerage Account \nTo open your new account at Webull, you will need to provide your basic personal and financial information. \nPersonal Information \nWhen opening your account online, you will be asked to provide personal and contact information: \nName\nAddress\nSocial Security number \nDate of birth\nPhone number\nEmail address\nDriver’s license or other valid form of government ID\nFinancial Information \nIn addition to providing your personal information, you will be asked to provide your employment and basic financial information. After your account application has been approved, you will then have the option to fund your account via ACH transfer from your current U.S. bank account or wire transfer from U.S. or foreign banks (fees may apply for wire transfers). \nUnlike a full service brokerage, Webull does not ask you about your financial goals or long-term financial planning. The platform currently offered is transactional in nature only. If you are looking for a low-cost, no-commission platform that is easy to use for placing trades, Webull is a good option. However, if you are looking for a more comprehensive platform–offering account consolidation, goal planning, or research–you may need to look elsewhere. \nThe Benefits of Trading on Webull \nThe most obvious benefit of opening an account and trading fractional shares at Webull is the speed of the process. You can literally open an account within minutes and start trading. Webull offers thousands of U.S. stocks and ETFs for fractional share trading. However, you can really only determine which stocks and ETFs are currently on the list by searching in your account dashboard and seeing if the green diamond icon that indicates fractional share availability is by the stock or ETF. \nIn terms of the quality of the trading platform, Webull offers a decent selection of charting tools and a basic stock screener. Webull may not be as full-featured as larger brokers, but for a streamlined, no-fee brokerage, it is more than adequate for fundamental stock research and basic technical analysis. Webull also offers access to other assets, including options that will appeal to more active traders. \nAnother differentiating factor is that Webull offers margin trading. Because of the volatility of the market and the fact that trading on margin is actually borrowing money from Webull that you must pay back with interest, this option may be best suited for a more seasoned investor. It is important to remember that when investing using a margin account that you will still have to pay back the original amount borrowed plus interest even if the stocks lose value. \nAll that said, buying fractional shares with a cash account is quick and easy, and funding your Webull account can be done via either ACH funds transfer or wire transfer. \nInvestopedia Gives Webull Top Ratings For: \nBest Broker for Low-Cost Options Trading\nBest Low-Cost Day Trading Platform\nBest Low-Cost Options Broker\nFactors to Consider When Investing in Fractional Shares \nSelection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Webull offers thousands of stocks and ETFs for fractional share investing. However, in order to find which stocks or ETFs are approved, you must search the specific stock from your Webull account dashboard and look for the green diamond icon to determine if the stock can be traded in fractional shares or not. \nFees and commissions: Getting started at Webull is simple with $0 commissions for online U.S. stock and ETF trades. There are also no account management fees or inactivity fees to buy and sell fractional shares. \nAccount minimums: Investors at Webull can buy fractional shares for as low as $5; there is no minimum to open an account. \nResearch amenities: Once you open an account with Webull, you will have access to limited research amenities from your account dashboard. Investors can go to the “markets” tab and search any stock or ETF to see the current market price and basic information. The “news” tab is another resource that compiles articles from multiple sources across the internet on trending financial topics. \nEducational content: The educational content provided by Webull is basic information on how to invest, what investment products the brokerage offers, and how to use the Webull app. Investors can access this library of videos from the “learn” tab. \nFAQs \nWhat Are Fractional Shares?\nFractional shares allow investors to buy a fraction, or portion, of a whole share of a stock. Investing in fractional shares helps you to easily diversify your portfolio and invest in companies that you may otherwise not be able to easily buy shares of. For instance, if you want to invest in a company, but the stock price is $100 per share, you don’t need to have $100 to buy a full share. At Webull, you can invest in this company for as little as $5. In this case, your stake in the company will be 0.05 of a full share (5/100). With this strategy, you are investing based on a specific dollar amount that you set, not an individual stock’s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing themto gain market entry sooner into expensive stocks. Moreover, with fractional shares of ETFs, investors can diversify their portfolio at smaller account values than would otherwise be possible. \nWhat Is Webull?\nWebull, founded in 2017, is a Chinese-owned company headquartered in New York. Webull is a discount broker that offers limited services and a straightforward, no-frills platform. Offering commission-free trades, no fees, and no account minimum requirements, Webull has positioned itself to serve newer and more active traders. Currently, the company offers standard brokerage accounts, which provide the choice to invest in: \nStocks\nETFs\nOptions\nFractional share trading is currently offered on thousands of stocks and ETFs at Webull, but it is only available for the latest version of the mobile app. Keep in mind that only stocks and ETFs from an approved list are available for fractional share trading, so while you may want to invest in options or crypto, that cannot be done fractionally at this time.5\nDo Fractional Shares Make You Money?\nInvesting in fractional shares is a good way to dollar-cost average your money into the market. \nWhen utilizing this strategy on a regular basis, you will be buying fractions of several stocks over the course of time, which will accumulate into a portfolio that includes full shares of multiple stocks. Buying shares of a stock over time reduces the effect of market timing where you may be paying a premium or getting a discount on a transaction based on market factors. Lowering the total cost paid for an asset can make you money, provided that the asset appreciates over time. Over time, diversified portfolios are more likely than not to appreciate.\nCan You Buy Fractional Shares on Charles Schwab?\nWebull is not the only option when it comes to fractional share trading. Charles Schwab is an excellent online platform to buy fractional shares of stocks. Investors can choose from any stock listed on the approved list of S&P 500 stocks for an investment as low as $5.6 Schwab also allows investors to choose up to 30 “slices” each time they place an order, so diversifying your portfolio is quite easy to do. As many options as investors have when buying fractional shares at Charles Schwab, ETFs are one product that is not currently available. Webull offers fractional shares on select ETFs, as do other Schwab competitors like Fidelity. \nAre Fractional Shares Harder to Sell?\nNot owning a full share of a company can make it more complicated when you want to sell it. Webull offers investors fractional share trading as market orders only. When selling, there is a minimum of 0.00001 shares per order for closing fractional share positions. It is also noted on the website that “the rule of $5 minimum doesn't work for closing fractional share positions.” Fractional shares are not able to be transferred, so any fractional share would need to be sold prior to a transfer taking place.7\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "6 Best Investment Accounts for Handling Uninvested Cash\nWe independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. \nWhen you hold uninvested cash in your brokerage account, this is money that’s not earning a return in the market. This can feel like a wasted opportunity, especially at a time when banks are paying some of the highest interest rates in over a decade. \nFortunately, some investment platforms offer features where your uninvested cash earns interest. The broker itself doesn’t pay interest. Instead, it puts idle cash from investors into an FDIC-insured bank account. This system, known as a cash sweep program, can allow you to still earn a decent interest rate while keeping your money available to invest. Ideally, a sweep program is convenient, doesn’t charge you a fee, and has simple account requirements. If you expect to hold uninvested cash, here are the best investment accounts worth considering. \nBest Investment Platforms for Handling Uninvested Cash \nBetterment \nKey Specs \nAccount Minimum: $0, $10 minimum to start investing\nFees: 0.25% (annual) for investing plan accounts with at least $20,000 or at least $250 per month in recurring account deposits ($4/month for smaller balances); optional 0.65% (annual) fee on accounts with at least $100,000 in assets in investment and cryptocurrency accounts unlocks premium with unlimited access to certified financial planners (for accounts with at least $2 million, there is a fee discount of 0.10%)\nOverview \nIf you’d like help with your portfolio, Betterment is a robo-advisor that takes care of the investment decisions for you. You simply pick a type of portfolio strategy, then Betterment’s robo-advisor will build a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets to meet these goals. In exchange, it charges a flat fee: $4 per month or 0.25% of accounts worth at least $20,000.1 This is considerably less than the 1% or more per year charged by a human advisor. \nTo go with its robo-advisor, Betterment offers a high-yield cash account called Cash Reserve. The Cash Reserve account earns a very high annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.50% APY on all balances, as of October 2024. There’s no minimum balance required to earn interest and the rate applies to all accounts, and your balance receives FDIC insurance up to $2 million.2 \nOnce you’re ready to invest, you can then transfer the cash to your Betterment portfolios. Alternatively, Betterment offers a no-fee checking account.3 You could transfer cash to this account to spend on a debit card or make ATM withdrawals. However, it doesn’t earn interest like the Cash Reserve account. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nPays an excellent cash interest rate\nNo account minimum to earn interest\nRobo-advisor automatically manages investments\nGood selection of investment portfolios\nEasy-to-use accounts \nCons\nNo investment options beyond the robo-advisor\nPortfolios only use ETFs as investments\nDoesn’t allow margin trading\nNo weekend live customer service\nInteractive Brokers \nKey Specs \nAccount Minimum: $0\nFees: $0 commissions for equities/ETFs available on IBKR’s TWS Lite, or low costs scaled by volume for active traders that want access to advanced functionality such as order routing; $0.65 per contract for options on TWS Light; $0.65 base rate for TWS Pro users, with scaled rates based on volume; $0.85 per contract for futures\nOverview \nInteractive Brokers is one of the best options for serious traders and investors. Its platform offers a wide range of investment technology, advanced research, and access to over 150 markets. Interactive Brokers offers commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs through its IBKR Lite program. It does charge low commissions for its more advanced IBKR Pro platform in exchange for more trading capabilities and better order execution. \nInteractive Brokers offers a program for uninvested cash that should be highly appealing for serious investors. As of October 2024, it pays an interest rate of 3.33% for IBKR Lite accounts and 4.33% for IBKR Pro accounts on balances above $10,000.4 As rates change over time, IBKR Lite accounts earn one percentage point less than IBKR Pro. You don’t need to opt in to earn interest. However, you can join an additional sweep program to get more FDIC insurance on your cash balance: $2.5 million of coverage on top of the normal SIPC coverage of $250,000.5 \nThe drawback with Interactive Brokers is you need a large account balance to earn its best rate. If your total brokerage account balance is over $100,000, you earn interest on all your uninvested cash. However, if your account value is less than $100,000, Interactive Brokers will not pay interest on your first $10,000 of uninvested cash. On an $11,000 cash balance, only $1,000 would earn interest. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nHigh interest rate on uninvested cash\nPowerful, customizable brokerage platform\nSuperior order execution\nVast range of markets and investment options\nLow margin rates\nCons\nRestricts interest payments for accounts less than $100,000\nPlatform can be overwhelming to learn\nComplicated fee structure\nCharges commissions for IBKR Pro trades\nSmartRouting not available for IBKR Lite accounts\nWealthfront \nKey Specs \nAccount Minimum: $500 for the robo-advisor, $1 for stocks\nFees: 0.25% for most accounts; no trading commission or fees for withdrawals, minimums, or transfers\nOverview \nWealthfront is another highly rated robo-advisor.

You start by answering a few questions about your investment goals, and the robo-advisor goes to work to build you a suitable portfolio.6 You can also make zero-commission trades in stocks with Wealthfront. \nAs of October 2024, Wealthfront’s Cash Account pays a highly competitive APY of 4.50%.7 The high interest rate applies to all your uninvested cash. There is no minimum or maximum balance. You just deposit cash and earn interest until you’re ready to invest. Your cash receives up to $8 million in FDIC insurance (and $16 million for joint accounts) thanks to the banks Wealthfront works with.8 \nThere are no account fees or restrictions for the Cash Account. You can transfer money in and out as often as you want. You also receive a debit card to make purchases. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nExcellent interest rate for uninvested cash\nNo fees or account requirements for earning interest\nGood range of robo-advisor investment options\nOffers free financial planning tools\nAutomatic, daily tax-loss harvesting\nCons\nNo human advisors available\nLimited investments besides stocks and the robo-advisor\nLimited chat and customer service\nNo fee reduction or extra support for larger accounts\nEmpower \nKey Specs \nAccount Minimum: $100,000 for wealth management, $0 for individual investment accounts\nFees: 0.89% to 0.49% for accounts over $1 million\nOverview \nEmpower combines the technology and convenience of a robo-advisor with the support of traditional financial advisors. Its platform offers ongoing portfolio allocation recommendations, rebalancing, tax optimization, and unlimited access to speak with a human advisor. To use this service, though, you need an account balance of at least $100,000.9 If you invest on your own, Empower’s investment accounts do not have an initial balance requirement. \nEmpower’s Personal Cash account also does not have a minimum account balance requirement. As of October 2024, the account earns a high APY of 4.20%, and there are no balance requirements or fees to earn this interest rate.10 However, you do need to transfer your cash out of any Empower investment account into the cash account to earn interest; it doesn’t happen automatically. \nEmpower offers aggregate FDIC insurance up to $5 million on your balance. While you can transfer money out of the cash account as often as you want, Empower does set a daily withdrawal limit of $100,000.

It does not require a minimum account balance, charges no fees or commissions on stock and ETF trades, and has low administrative fees.11 Its platform is user-friendly for beginners, yet offers plenty of screeners, portfolio analysis tools, and other features for serious investors. For this reason, it ranked as the best overall broker in our review of Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms. \nFidelity’s program for uninvested cash is also simple and competitive, offering 4.52% on uninvested cash through a sweep into money market funds.12 Fidelity's cash management program operates more like a bank account, offering bill pay, an ATM card, and mobile check deposit. The cash management program earns an APY of 2.47%, as of October 2024.13 If you have both types of Fidelity accounts, you can transfer cash back and forth. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nAutomatically pays a high interest rate on cash\nAll sized accounts earn interest\nLow costs and trading commissions\nUser-friendly, powerful investment platform\nHigh quality research tools and educational materials\nCons\nCharges fees for international stock and currency trades\nNo commodities or futures trading\nHigh fees for broker-assisted trades\nAbove-average fees for options \nRobinhood \nKey Specs \nAccount Minimum: $0\nFees: $0 commissions for stock, ETF, options, and cryptocurrency trading (small markup is priced in)\nOverview \nWhen it first hit the scene, Robinhood made a big splash in the investment world. Robinhood’s app made investing incredibly easy—some might say even too easy. Robinhood’s trading app offers zero-commission trades for stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies. Its investment research tools are a little limited compared to major desktop platforms, but are enough for casual investors. \nRobinhood does have a competitive program for uninvested cash, but there’s a catch. You must have a Robinhood Gold account to qualify for its highly advertised rate. Robinhood Gold offers premium features like Morningstar research, a larger limit for instant deposits, and lower rates for margin investing at a cost of $5 per month.14 \nIf you pay for Robinhood Gold, you earn 4.50% on all your uninvested cash. However, if you just have a free Robinhood account, you only earn 0.1%. Whether the $5 monthly fee is worth it depends on the size of your cash balance and whether you want the other Gold benefits. To use Robinhood’s program, you must opt in to use cash sweep on the app. This makes you eligible to earn interest and increases the FDIC coverage of your cash balance to $2.25 million. There’s no minimum or maximum balance requirement to earn interest.15 \nPros & Cons \nPros\nHigh interest rate for Robinhood Gold users\nZero commission trades \nApp is very easy to use\nFractional share trading available\nNo minimum balance requirements\nCons\nMust pay $5 monthly for Robinhood Gold for highest APY\nFree accounts earn a moderate interest rate\nOnly basic research tools\nLimited asset selection\nResearch Insights\nWhen evaluating investment accounts for uninvested cash, accessibility is crucial to ensuring that investors can easily access their cash when needed without facing unnecessary restrictions or penalties. Additionally, safety is paramount, with investors seeking accounts that offer FDIC insurance to safeguard their uninvested cash against the loss of their deposits in an FDIC-insured bank or savings association that fails. The APY earned is another critical consideration, as investors aim to maximize the return on their uninvested cash while maintaining liquidity and safety. \nMoreover, investors should also assess any associated fees or account minimums when comparing investment accounts for uninvested cash. Minimizing fees and meeting any required minimum balances can help investors optimize their cash management strategy and maximize the return on their uninvested cash. By prioritizing liquidity, safety, yield, and cost-effectiveness, investors can select an investment account that aligns with their cash management needs and helps them achieve their financial goals effectively. - Amrut Deshmukh, Investopedia Research Analyst\nFinal Verdict \nAll the brokers on this list offer excellent programs for uninvested cash, assuming you can qualify for the best rates. The right fit depends on your investment goals as well as expected account balance. Interactive Brokers makes sense for serious investors who want the most investment capabilities, but it is actually Fidelity with the highest interest rate and an amazing platform of its own.\nBetterment and Wealthfront are both solid if you want a robo-advisor. They are quite similar and the right fit depends on which platform you prefer. Empower’s cash account is also very good. There’s no minimum account balance to use it, plus you get access to free financial planning tools. However, you need $100,000 to invest through Empower’s robo-advisor. Last, Robinhood’s program is very competitive if you’re willing to pay $5 monthly for Robinhood Gold. Otherwise, its rate is mediocre compared to the others. \nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow Else Can You Earn Interest on Cash?\nOutside of the brokerage accounts, the simplest way to earn interest on cash is by keeping it in a high-yield savings account or money market account. There are online banks paying interest rates far above what you would earn from the major brick-and-mortar banks. With savings and money market accounts, you also keep instant access to your cash.\nIf you’re willing to lock your money up temporarily, you could put it in a bank certificate of deposit (CD). These can pay a higher interest rate, but you need to keep the money in for a set number of months or years. If you withdraw it early, you must pay a penalty. Bonds are another option. They pay interest, but there can be a risk of nonpayment, like if the bond issuer goes bankrupt. Generally, the higher the bond risk, the higher the interest rate. Rating agencies give companies, governments, and other bond issuers a letter grade showing how safe they are.\nWhat Are Some Risk-Free Areas for Investing Your Cash?\nSavings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are a risk-free way to invest your cash. These accounts receive FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. Even if the bank goes bankrupt, the government promises you’ll get your money back. Cash in a brokerage account is also very safe as it is insured by the SIPC up to $250,000.\nU.S. government bonds are also considered risk-free because of the stability of the United States. The federal government promises to make these payments and return your principal. Treasuries, I-Bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a few possibilities. A fixed annuity is one more very safe option. These contracts pay a set interest rate, guaranteed by an insurance company. You do agree to keep the money in the annuity for a set number of years, though, or you’ll owe a penalty for canceling.\nWhat Is the Cash Earnings Interest on Robinhood?\nAs of September 2024, the cash earnings interest rate on Robinhood was 0.1% APY for free accounts and 4.50% for Robinhood Gold accounts. You do need to pay $5 a month for Robinhood Gold to get the higher rate. The interest rates also change based on market conditions.\nTo start earning interest on your Robinhood balance, you must enroll in its cash sweep program. Then the app automatically places your uninvested cash in banks to earn the high interest rate. This program gives you additional FDIC protection, insuring your balance up to $2.25 million for uninvested cash.16\nJose Luis Pelaez Inc / Getty Images\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

  "text": "How to Invest in Commodities\nAdding commodities to a portfolio, either through physical ownership or investment brokers, provides diversification and can even offer a hedge against price exposure further up the value chain of certain industries. Energy products like oil, gas, and coal; agricultural products like corn, soy, canola, pork, and beef; and metals like gold, silver, copper, and platinum all have well understood market dynamics and relatively simple financial instruments to act as trading vehicles. Many commodities are priced according to the market demand and the need for further processing. In a world where many financial assets are derivatives, trackers, and derivatives of derivatives, with layers of market sentiment influencing their performance, commodities can offer a more direct experience. We will take a look at the major commodities and how you can use them to fit your investment needs. \nHow to Invest in Commodities \nInvestors can access commodities in a few different ways. \nPhysical Ownership \nOwning physical commodities mainly applies to precious metals. Gold and silver are two of the best-known commodities that are used as physical stores of value. Investors can purchase these metals formed into bullion, with standard size and purity. Bullion bars are the closest in value to the melt price (the market price for the metal if you melted it down). Owning precious metals in physical form comes with issues of storage, insurance, and liquidity. Commodities beyond precious metals have further storage issues in that the quantities are often larger and there is a shelf life, so they must be sold within a given timeframe. This is why most commodities investors do not pursue physical ownership. To trade physical commodities, you need to find a reputable dealer and, most likely, a storage facility for your holdings. \nFutures Contracts \nFutures contracts are direct plays on commodity prices. Futures contracts are an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of a commodity at a specified price and date in the future. Investors use leveraged margin accounts to allow them to take larger positions with their existing capital. In the vast majority of trades, the contracts are cash settled. This saves an investor from having to take delivery of hundreds of thousands of pounds of sugar or figure out how to market a thousand head of cattle. Opening an account to trade futures contracts will often require some additional paperwork to enable margin trading as well as a higher account minimum. The specific maintenance margin needed in an account varies with the value of the contract being traded. \nIndividual Securities \nIndividual securities related to commodity processing or production can be accessed through a regular brokerage account. You can find the companies using a stock screener and looking for basic materials or energy sector companies. Investors looking for commodity exposure through company shares generally have to gain some industry-specific knowledge to be successful. For example, extraction companies in mining and energy have well-developed systems for feasibility studies on reserves that, in turn, drive the stock value. Larger companies will have reserves in different parts of the world and in different stages of development, meaning the impact of any one feasibility study is not a big deal as long as overall operations are profitable. A smaller company, however, may experience heightened price volatility based on the findings of a single feasibility study. \nMutual Funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) \nProducts traded on exchanges include commodity-based mutual funds, ETFs, and exchange-traded notes, which can provide exposure to commodities. There are exchange-traded products that are specific to individual commodities. These pool investor funds to combine capital in a commodity pool. The actual mechanism for investment depends on what is outlined by the fund. The fund managers could buy futures, options on futures, shares in companies in the sector, or even purchase and store physical goods. Some funds are leveraged, meaning they are attempting to provide double or triple the price movement of the commodity they are tracking. This is why it is important to read the fund disclosures prior to investing to ensure the exposure being offered matches your investment needs. \nAlternative Investments \nCommodities are considered an alternative investment along with things like real estate that don’t trade in the conventional style of stocks and bonds. Within precious metals, however, there is a subcategory of alternative investments that are closer to collectibles than they are to investments. Bullion coins and jewelry have an aesthetic and historical value that generally sees them trade at a premium compared to the melt price of the metals they contain. While these are still physical investments that can appreciate in value, their prices are less connected to market prices. You can buy jewelry from stores and coins directly from the Mint or from dealers, but they are more of a collectible than they are a commodity investment. \nCompare Top Investment Platforms \nWhat Do You Need to Open a Commodities Investing Account? \nOpening a commodities investing account is the same process as opening a regular brokerage account. If you are just looking to invest in commodities through companies and funds, it literally is a regular brokerage account as these two investment classes do not require anything special. If you will be trading futures and options, however, you first need to confirm your broker provides these options. Then you will usually have to make some additional disclosures to ensure you understand the risks and have enough capital so that it will not be wiped out in a single trade. \nWhat You Need to Open a Brokerage Account \nTo open a brokerage account, you need to provide some personal and financial information and answer some basic questions. \nPersonal Information \nThe personal and financial information includes: \nName, address, and telephone number\nTax identification number (usually your Social Security number)\nDate of birth and government ID \nBanking information for funding the account\nLevel of investment experience and risk tolerance (the know your client (KYC) questions)\nWith online brokerages, the first step is usually to set up an account (email and password) with the broker and then provide these further details as part of the onboarding process. \nMinimum Deposits \nWhile there are many brokerage accounts with zero account minimums, enabling futures trading in a margin account will generally require that at least a few thousand dollars be held with the broker. Depending on the contracts you are looking to trade, the actual amount of capital required to trade will be more than whatever the minimum deposit is to enable the account. Both the initial margin and the maintenance margin for futures accounts may be influenced by the account type (individual retirement account vs. non-IRA account). \nWhat You Need to Open a Gold IRA \nGold individual retirement accounts (gold IRAs) are a type of commodity investing for retirement purposes. Unlike a regular IRA, you will have to find a custodian to hold the physical assets. You set up a gold IRA by first establishing a self-directed IRA, selecting a custodian to administer the account, selecting an approved depository to hold the gold, and then choosing a broker/dealer to buy the gold through. Some gold IRA providers have these services integrated or will refer clients to providers in their network. \nPersonal Information \nThe documents and information required are the same as those for investment accounts: \nName, address, and telephone number\nTax identification number (usually your Social Security number)\nDate of birth and government ID \nAdditional KYC questions \nMinimum Deposits \nMinimum deposits for a gold IRA are high. This is partially owing to the fact that an ounce of gold is worth over $1000 and even smaller coins are worth several hundred dollars. The IRS rules state that only approved coins and bars of gold can be used for a gold IRA, but they do not set a minimum. While not all gold IRAs advertise a minimum, a practical amount would be at least $2000. Other gold IRAs have minimums of $10,000, $25,000, and even $60,000. \nBest Gold and Silver IRAs \nPros and Cons of Commodity Investing \nCommodity investing, like any other type of investing, comes with advantages and disadvantages. \nPros \nInvestors are attracted to commodity investing for its ability to provide an inflation hedge, diversify a portfolio, and unlock potentially large returns. \nInflation hedge: The prices of commodities tend to rise with inflation. In fact, commodity prices are often watched as indicators of an inflationary environment. While there can be commodity-specific market conditions that counter overall inflation, such as a bumper crop, in general commodities move with inflation and can balance out the dampening effect that inflation may have on other assets in an investor’s portfolio. \nDiversification: Even outside of an inflationary environment, commodities provide portfolio diversification due to a low correlation with financial assets. Commodities are influenced more by basic factors like supply and demand rather than employment numbers or central bank policies.\nPotential for large returns: Commodities like oil, gold, and soft commodities with cyclical production can experience large price movements. Commodities are sensitive to production forecasts and global events that impact supply chains. These opportunities for profit are what attracts investors to the commodities market. \nCons \nThe downsides to commodity investing are a lack of income, high volatility, and external risks. \nLack of income: Investing in commodities doesn’t generate yield income like a bond or a dividend-paying stock. All of the return on a commodities investment depends on correctly predicting the price movements. \nHigh volatility: Commodities can see their market dynamics shift wildly based on global events. Wheat prices, for example, shot up in 2022 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and this price movement impacted the futures and options market around wheat. There were similar impacts in the oil and gas markets due to Russia’s position as a major supplier, but these were not quite as sharp. \nExternal risks: When it comes to commodities, there are many risks that an investor simply has no control over. In addition to regional conflicts taking supply offline, there are climate risks with the wrong weather at the wrong time, regulatory risks and political risks that can hinder the flow of goods, supply chain risks, and so on. All of these risks are, of course, the main reason for the volatility and the opportunity for large returns. \nFactors to Consider When Opening an Investment Account \nCommodities investing is not available through every broker. This is especially true for digital investment managers that limit their investing to ETFs and stocks. Larger brokers and trading-focused platforms generally do offer futures trading. This includes brokers like Schwab, Interactive Brokers, and E*TRADE, as well as more focused platforms like NinjaTrader and TradeStation. Below are the main factors to consider when opening an investment account for commodities trading. \nCustomer Support \nCustomer support can vary widely between brokers. Most brokers still offer phone and email support, while some have added in-platform chat and social media channels for customers to reach them. A handful of brokers have gone the other way, with digital-only customer service offerings via FAQs and email contact forms. When it comes to customer service, you want to make sure the broker can be reached via your preferred method. \nFees \nFees have become much more competitive for stocks and ETFs, with most brokers charging nothing at all. When it comes to futures, however, fees are calculated on a per-contract basis and can vary from mere cents to a few dollars. While the temptation is to find the lowest fee broker for futures, it is important to consider it in the context of the quality of the overall trading platform. \nAvailable Assets \nWhile most brokers offer both ETFs and stocks, futures is more of a niche offering. If you are looking to invest in commodities, you are probably going to want access to the major futures exchanges unless you plan on solely working through ETFs. \nSecurity and Reputation \nGenerally speaking, you want to know that your broker is keeping your portfolio safe and has your best interests at heart. At a minimum, you want to see security protocols that are up to industry standards with two-factor authentication and plans in place to prevent outages and data breaches. \nMinimum Deposit \nOverall we like to see brokers with low minimum deposits to encourage people to invest. When it comes to futures, however, an investor should have a sizable amount of capital both to enable the margin account and ensure they can handle potential swings without devastating their portfolios. Commodities investing is definitely a risk capital activity and shouldn’t make up the majority of your investment portfolio. \nResearch Tools \nResearch tools can be important in helping you understand and visualize market dynamics when investing in commodities. Robust trading platforms can help by pulling quotes into charts and analyzing volume and volatility along with other important information like headlines and calendar events. Some brokers charge for extra data feeds, but this is another area where competition has lowered the overall costs. \nFAQs \nWhat Are Commodities?\nCommodities are the raw, or simplest, form of inputs that go into processing that turns them into energy, food, consumer products, and so on. \nMetals are an example of a commodity and encompasses a group of commodities with more complicated dynamics. Many metal commodities are well known. Gold is traded as a commodity and is often used as a hedge or safe haven against downturns in the financial markets. Silver has a similar hedge angle to it and shares some common traits with gold in terms of collectibility and jewelry, but it also has industrial applications that play a role in its demand. More common metals like copper see their demand rise with basic economic activity, as they are primarily destined for further applications in industry. Steel is also traded as a commodity even though it is a value-added form of iron. The many, many applications of steel make it a commodity in terms of the type of hedging and financial exposure market participants are looking for. \nMetals aren’t the only commodities where the market holds different forms of the same input. Sugar, which is considered a soft commodity on account of being perishable, is traded as Sugar No. 11, Sugar No. 16, and White Sugar. Sugar No. 11 is the raw product benchmark with Sugar No. 16 having a market nuance in being meant for U.S. consumption, and White Sugar referring to the more refined product that goes into yet other products. \nAlthough many commodities travel the globe, like metals and sugar, the actual volume of trading will vary significantly and may also have seasonal trends. The volume on copper commodity contracts, for example, is often many times that of an agricultural soft commodity like soybean oil. Commodities that are less widely traded often require a bit more work to understand in terms of the market dynamics and pricing pressures, but acquiring this specialized knowledge can make a big difference for investors and traders looking to profit from the global trade of inputs.\nWhat Is Commodities Investing?\nCommodities investing is simply adding exposure to commodities as an asset class. This could be directly, as with physical assets like gold or silver bullion, or through financial derivatives that trade on exchanges. Financial derivatives include options and futures, as well as commodity tracking funds and shares in companies that are directly involved in producing or processing a commodity. The main reasons for commodity investing are the potential for large returns, the inflation hedge, and the diversity it brings to a portfolio due to a low correlation with the rest of the financial markets. \nWhat Are Some of the Most Popular Commodities to Invest In?\nSome of the most widely traded commodities include:\nPrecious metals (gold, silver, platinum, etc.)\nOil\nNatural gas\nGasoline\nCorn\nWheat\nSoybeans\nCattle\nHogs\nSugar\nLumber\nIt is noteworthy that the actual volume of futures trading is now dominated by futures on financial assets rather than raw commodities. Equity index, interest rates, and currencies all generate more contract volume than agriculture, energy, or metals.1\nHow Do Leveraged Commodity ETFs Work?\nCommodities are also traded by leveraged commodity funds that, in turn, trade as fund shares. These are often split into bull and bear funds, making it clear which market position they are taking. Unlike a direct futures or options position, an investor in a bear or bull fund is buying shares in the fund that is using its available capital to make direct and indirect trades related to the underlying commodity. For example, a leveraged fund can hold futures, options, shares, and other financial instruments like contracts for difference (CFD) with the goal of delivering some multiple of the reference indices performance. So a leveraged oil fund looking to provide two times West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI), for example, is aiming to give you two times whatever the change is in WTI short-term price.",

  "text": "How to Invest When You're Broke\nThe old saying that it takes money to make money is true. For those living paycheck to paycheck, there often isn't enough money left over to put toward investing. When you need the money now, finding a broker for an individual retirement account (IRA) and investing in the stock market might be far down on your priority list. However, by reading this article and gaining knowledge, you are taking one of the necessary first steps in building a retirement nest egg. \nKey Takeaways\nSetting aside small amounts of money can help you save even if the idea of investing is daunting.\nDividend reinvestment plans allow you to buy small amounts of dividend-paying stocks straight from the company while reinvesting the dividends.\nYou can buy one ETF share at a time through a broker.\nAlthough target-date funds divvy up your investment based on your target retirement date, they often have large minimums to initially invest and may have substantial fees.\nA 401(k) with matching funds is essentially free money and therefore should take priority over outside investments.\nInvestors who are in debt need to understand what kind of debt they are in and may need to prioritize paying off the debt over investing for a period of time.\nYou Need Money \nThe fact remains that you must put money away for later years or face a possible catastrophic situation. Someday, you won't be able to work and Social Security won't be enough to live on—assuming the fund is around in 20 or 30 years. You can start investing now with less money than you think it will take. \nFirst, we have to solve the problem of limited funds and the advice isn't new or revolutionary. Something in your life has to go, but it doesn't have to be a big life change. Simple changes that save $1 here and $5 there can add up to make a big impact. \nWe've put together a few ideas for those people who don't see any available funds for investing. \nNote\nAs with anything else, make sure you consult a financial professional about your investment options. This is especially important if you're trying to juggle saving while paying off your debts.\nDividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPS) \nDividend reinvestment plans (DRIPS) allow you to invest small amounts of money into a dividend-paying stock, by purchasing directly from the company. \nCompanies like GE, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson are just a few of the companies that allow you to make regular purchases of very small amounts of stock, and reinvest the dividends.12345 \nThis can add up to a big investment over time and, as you gain a larger balance, you may consider diverting some of these funds into other investments. \nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) \nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are financial products that track the performance of a certain sector of the investment market. You can buy as little as one share of an ETF through a broker, and some of these ETFs track the performance of the total stock market, the bond market, and many others. \nMany ETFs also pay a dividend, so purchasing a fund like the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) will bring exposure to an instantly diversified portfolio that also pays a dividend.6 \nTarget-Date Funds \nTarget-date funds, as the name implies, target your retirement date by changing the percentage of stocks and bonds to ensure that your money remains safe as you approach retirement age. \nSome of these funds require a minimum investment of $1,000, but they may serve as great products for investors who don't want to manage their portfolios on their own. But make sure you use caution when picking a target-date fund because of the high fees that some of these vehicles charge.7 \nThe 401(k) \nThe 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows you to put away a portion of your paycheck into an investment account. The plan comes with tax savings depending on the type of plan you have: \nIf you invest in a traditional 401(k), you can set aside pre-tax dollars, which lowers your taxable income and, therefore, your tax liability.\nIf you invest in a Roth 401(k), any withdrawals you make during retirement are tax-free.\nIf you have a 401(k) that will match your contributions, invest there first. Since your company is giving you free money to invest, you should consider funding your 401(k) before outside investments. \nInvesting While in Debt \nIf you have some money saved or invested, you want to see it grow over time. Many factors can prevent this from happening. Debt is one of the biggest obstacles for some people. If you have a sizable amount of debt to deal with, whether it's a mortgage, line of credit (LOC), student loan, or credit card, you can still learn how to balance your debt with saving and investing. \nHaving debt can make it very difficult for investors to make money. In some cases, investing while in debt is like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a coffee cup. For instance, if you owe money on a LOC with 7% interest, the money you put aside will have to make more than 7% (after taxes and fees) to make it more profitable than paying down the debt. Some investments deliver such high returns, but you have to be able to find them, knowing you are under the burden of debt. \nIt is important to briefly distinguish between the different kinds of debt that may be incurred. \nHigh-Interest Debt \nHigh interest is relative, but anything above 10% is a good candidate for this category. Having said that, you can probably count your credit card as a high-interest debt. Carrying any kind of balance on your credit card or similar high-interest vehicle makes paying it down a priority before starting to invest. \nLow-Interest Debt \nThis type of low-interest debt may often be a car loan, a line of credit, or a personal loan from a bank. \nThe interest rates are usually described as a prime plus or minus a certain percentage, so there is still some performance pressure from investing with this type of debt. It is, however, much less daunting to make a portfolio that returns 12% than one that has to return 25%. \nOne thing to keep in mind, though, is that your credit score determines your interest rate. The better your score, the lower your rate. But if you have a less-than-stellar credit history, the chance of obtaining a low-interest loan may be small. \nTax-Deductible Debt \nIf there is such a thing as good debt, this is it. Tax-deductible debts include mortgages, student loans, business loans, investment loans, and all the other loans in which interest paid is returned to you in the form of tax deductions. Since this debt is generally low interest as well, you can easily build a portfolio while paying it down. \nThe types of debt we focus on here are long-term low-interest and tax-deductible debt, such as mortgage payments. If you do have high-interest debt, you'll likely want to focus on paying it off before you begin your investing adventure. \nNot all interest-bearing loans are tax-deductible. Be sure to check with your lender or a financial professional whether you can deduct the interest on your loan.\nCompounding to Grow Money \nDebt elimination, particularly of something like a loan that will take long-term capital, robs you of time and money. In the long term, the time (in terms of the compounding time of your investment) that you lose is worth more to you than the money you actually pay (in terms of the money and interest that you are paying to your lender). \nYou want to give your money as much time as possible to compound. This is one of the reasons to start a portfolio despite carrying debt, but not the only one. Your investments may be small, but they will pay off more than investments you would make later in life because these small investments will have more time to mature. \nCreating a Plan to Invest \nInstead of making a traditional portfolio with high- and low-risk investments that are adjusted according to your tolerance and age, the idea is to make your loan payments in place of low-risk and/or fixed-income investments. \nThis means that you will be seeing returns from decreasing your debt load and interest payments rather than the 2% to 8% return on a bond or similar investment. \nThe rest of your portfolio should focus on higher-risk, high-return investments like stocks. If your risk tolerance is very low, the bulk of your investing money will still be going toward loan payments, but there will be a percentage that does make it into the market to produce returns for you. \nEven if you have a high-risk tolerance, you may not be able to put as much as you'd like into your investment portfolio because, unlike bonds, loans require a certain amount in monthly payments. Your debt load may force you to create a conservative portfolio with most of your money being invested in your loans and only a little going into your high-risk and return investments. As the debt gets smaller, you can adjust your distributions accordingly. \nHow Do You Invest With Little Money?\nBefore you start investing, it is wise to have your finances in as much order as possible. The first step would be to save up cash in an emergency fund, usually three to six months of your salary. The next would be to start paying down high-interest debt, such as credit card debt. Once that is resolved, it is wise to start putting money in a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) at work or an IRA. This should be a monthly contribution and is investing. From there, you can start investing outside of retirement plans, even if it is a small amount of money. A simple way to start investing is to choose an ETF, such as one that tracks the S&P 500, which will give you exposure to the broad market.\nHow Much Do You Need to Start Investing?\nYou do not need a lot of money to start investing. You can start investing in a retirement plan with any amount of money. If you have a 401(k) at work or your own IRA, putting any amount of money into the accounts will count as investing. If you want to invest in the stock market, having enough money to buy one share of a company's stock that you like will also be enough to get you started.\nHow Should a Beginner Invest?\nA beginner should start investing with contributions to a retirement plan. They should then choose index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A good way to start is also by choosing a robo-advisor that will make investment decisions for you based on the criteria you decide.\nThe Bottom Line \nYou can invest despite debt. The important question is whether or not you should. The answer to this question is personalized to your financial situation and risk tolerance. There are certainly benefits from getting your money into the market as soon as possible, but there is also no guarantee that your portfolio will perform as expected. These things depend on your investing strategy and market timing. \nThe biggest benefit of investing while in debt is psychological. Paying down long-term debts can be tedious and disheartening if you are not the type of person who puts your shoulder into a task and keeps pushing until it is done. For many people who are servicing debt, it seems like they are struggling to get to the point where their regular financial life—that of saving and investing—can begin. \nDebt becomes like a limbo state where things seem to be happening in slow motion. By having even a modest portfolio to track, you can keep your enthusiasm about the growth of your personal finances from ebbing. For some people, building a portfolio while in debt provides a much-needed ray of light.",

  "text": "Why Should I Consider Investing?\nInvesting is an effective way to have your money work for you and build wealth. Holding cash and bank savings accounts are considered safe strategies, but investing your money allows it to grow in value over time with the benefit of compounding and long-term growth. \nWhether you invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, futures, precious metals, real estate, or small businesses, investing is important to generate future income, increase value and equity, and build wealth. \nKey Takeaways\nInvesting is an effective way to have your money work for you and build wealth. \nInvestments may include a range of choices, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and real estate.1\nAn individual's investment goals depend on their income, age, and risk tolerance.\nWhy Investing Is Important at Any Age \nAn individual's goals depend on a host of factors that may include age, income, and risk profiles. Age can be further subdivided into the following three categories: \nYoung and starting in a career\nMiddle-aged and family-building\nRetirement age and self-directed\nThese segments often miss their marks at the appropriate age, with middle-aged folks considering investments for the first time or the elderly forced to budget, employing the discipline they lacked as young adults. \nIncome provides the natural starting point for investment planning because you can’t invest what you don’t have. A young adult's first job issues a wake-up call, forcing decisions about IRA contributions, savings, or money market accounts, and the sacrifices needed to balance growing affluence with the desire for gratification. Don't worry too much about setbacks during this period, like getting overwhelmed by student loans and car payments, or forgetting that your parents no longer pay the monthly credit card bill. \nOutlook defines the playing field on which we operate during our lifetimes and the choices that impact wealth management. Family planning sits at the top of this list for many individuals, with couples figuring out how many kids they want, where they want to live, and how much money is needed to accomplish those goals. Career expectations often complicate these calculations, with the highly-educated enjoying increased earning power while those stuck in low-level jobs are forced to cut back to make ends meet. \nIt’s never too late to become an investor. You may be well into middle age before realizing that life is moving quickly, requiring a plan to deal with old age and retirement. Fear can take control if waiting too long to set investment goals, but that should go away once you set the plan into motion. Remember that all investments start with the first dollar, whatever your age, income, or outlook. That said, those investing for decades have the advantage, with growing wealth allowing them to enjoy the lifestyle that others cannot afford. \nWhether your goal is to send your kids to college, build wealth to hand down, or to retire on a yacht in the Mediterranean, investing is essential in reaching your financial objectives in life.\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "Investing vs. Speculating: What's the Difference?\nInvesting vs. Speculating: An Overview \nInvestors and traders take on calculated risk as they attempt to profit from transactions they make in the markets. The level of risk undertaken in the transactions is the main difference between investing and speculating. \nWhenever a person spends money with the expectation that the endeavor will return a profit, they are investing. In this scenario, the undertaking bases the decision on a reasonable judgment made after a thorough investigation of the soundness that the endeavor has a good probability of success. \nBut what if the same person spends money on an undertaking that shows a high probability of failure? In this case, they are speculating. The success or failure depends primarily on chance, or on uncontrollable (external) forces or events. \nThe primary difference between investing and speculating is the amount of risk undertaken. High-risk speculation is typically akin to gambling, whereas lower-risk investing uses a basis of fundamentals and analysis. \nKey Takeaways\nThe main difference between speculating and investing is the amount of risk involved.\nInvestors try to generate a satisfactory return on their capital by taking on an average or below-average amount of risk.\nSpeculators are seeking to make abnormally high returns from bets that can go one way or the other.\nSpeculative traders often utilize futures, options, and short selling trading strategies.\nInvesting \nInvesting can come in many different forms—through monetary, time, or energy-based methods. In the financial sense of the term, investing means the buying and selling of securities such as stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and a variety of other financial products. \nInvestors hope to generate income or profit through a satisfactory return on their capital by taking on an average or below-average amount of risk. Income can be in the form of the underlying asset appreciating in value, in periodic dividends or interest payments, or in the full return of their spent capital. \nMost often, investing is the act of buying and holding an asset for the long-term. To classify as a long-term holding, the investor must own the asset for at least one year.1 \nLet's consider a large stable multinational company as an example of investing. This company may pay a consistent dividend that increases annually, and it may have a low business risk. An investor may choose to invest in this company over the long-term to make a satisfactory return on their capital while taking on relatively low risk. Additionally, the investor may add several similar companies across different industries to their portfolio to diversify and further lower their risk. \nAnalysis and research is a key part of the investment process. It involves evaluating different assets, sectors, and patterns or trends that occur in the market. Investors can use tools like fundamental or technical analysis to choose their investment strategies or design their portfolios. By using fundamental analysis, investors can determine what factors affect the value of securities, from microeconomic to macroeconomic factors. Technical analysis, on the other hand, uses statistical trends such as security prices and volumes to find opportunities in the market. \nInvestors have many options available for them to invest their money. Brokerage accounts give investors access to a variety of securities. By opening an account, an investor agrees to make deposits and then places orders through the firm. The assets and income belong to the investors, while the brokerage takes a commission for facilitating the trades. With new technology, investors can now invest with robo-advisers, too. These are automated investment companies that use an algorithm to come up with an investment strategy based on investors' goals and risk tolerance. \nSpeculating \nSpeculating is the act of putting money into financial endeavors with a high probability of failure. Speculating seeks abnormally high returns from bets that can go one way or the other. While speculating is likened to gambling, it is not exactly the same, as speculators try to make an educated decision on the direction of their trades. However, the inherent speculative risk involved in the transaction tends to be significantly above average. \nThese traders buy securities with the understanding that they will be held for only a short period before selling. They may frequently move into and out of a position. \nAs an example of a speculative trade, consider a volatile junior gold mining company with an equal chance over the near-term of skyrocketing from a new gold mine discovery or going bankrupt. With no news from the company, investors would tend to shy away from such a risky trade. However, some speculators may believe the junior gold mining company will strike gold and may buy its stock on a hunch. This hunch and the subsequent activity by investors is called speculation. \nSpeculative trading does have its downfalls. When there are inflated expectations of growth or price action for a particular asset class or sector, values will rise. When this happens, trading volume increases, eventually leading to a bubble. This happened with the dotcom bubble. Investment in Internet companies grew exponentially in the late 1990s, with valuations rising rapidly. The market crashed after 2001, causing major tech companies to lose a big chunk of their value, with many others being wiped out.2 \nTypes of Speculative Traders \nDay trading is a form of speculation. Day traders don't necessarily have any specific qualifications, rather, they are labeled as such because they trade often. They generally hold their positions for a day, closing once the trading session is complete. \nA swing trader, on the other hand, holds their position up to about several weeks hoping to capitalize on gains during that time. This is accomplished by trying to determine where a stock's price will move, taking a position, and then making a profit. \nTrades and Strategies \nSpeculators can make many types of trades and some of these include: \nFutures Contracts: Buyers and sellers agree to the sale of a specific asset at an agreeable price at a predetermined point in the future. The buyer agrees to buy the underlying asset once the contract expires. Futures contracts are traded on exchanges and are commonly used when trading commodities.\nPut and Call Options: In a put option, the owner of the contract has the right, but not the obligation, to sell any part of security at an agreed-upon price at a specified period of time. A call option, on the other hand, allows the contract owner to buy the underlying asset prior to the contract expiration date at a specified price.\nShort Selling: When a trader short sells, they speculate that the price of a security will drop in the future and then take a position.\nPopular strategies speculators use range from stop-loss orders to pattern trading. With a stop-loss order, a trader tells a broker to buy or sell a stock when it reaches a specific price. By doing this, the investor is able to minimize their loss on the stock. Meanwhile, pattern trading uses trends in prices to identify opportunities. Used in technical analysis, investors employ this strategy by looking at past market performance to make predictions about the future of an asset; a feat which is generally very challenging. \nSpecial Considerations \nBoth investors and speculators put their money into a variety of different investment vehicles including stocks and fixed-income options. Stocks or equities represent a certain percentage of ownership in a company. These are purchased on exchanges or through a private sale. Companies are ranked by market capitalization or the total market value of their outstanding shares. \nMutual funds and ETFs are also popular investment options. A mutual fund is managed by a fund manager who uses the pool of money from investors to purchase various assets and securities. ETFs hold a basket of underlying assets, and their prices change throughout the trading day just like those of stocks. \nFixed-income assets include bonds, bills, and notes. These can be issued by corporations or various levels of government. Many fixed-income assets are used to fund projects and (business) ventures, and pay interest before they mature, at which time the vehicle's face value is paid back to the investor. For example, a bond issued by the U.S. Treasury mature at 20 or 30 years and pays investors interest bi-annually.3 \nInvestors may want to consider the holding period for their investments and their tax implications. The holding period determines how much tax is owed on the investment. This period is calculated from the day after the investment is purchased until the day it is sold or disposed of. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers holdings of one-year or more to be long-term. Anything below this is considered a short-term investment. Long-term gains are generally taxed more favorably than short-term ones.1 \nAdvisor Insight\nStephen Rischall CFP®, CRPC\nNavalign Wealth Partners, Encino, CA\nIn general, the difference between investing and speculating is a long-term versus short-term time horizon.\nInvesting is synonymous with having the intention to buy an asset that will be held for a longer period. Typically, there is a strategy to buy and hold the asset for a particular reason, such as seeking appreciation or income.\nSpeculating tends to be synonymous with trading because it is more focused on shorter-term moves in the market. You would speculate because you think an event is going to impact a particular asset in the near term.\nSpeculators often use financial derivatives, such as options contracts, futures contracts, and other synthetic investments rather than buying and holding specific securities.\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "A Beginners' Guide to Managing Your Money\nThe internet has changed the way we live our lives. Not long ago purchasing stock was not as easy as it is now. The order went through a complex network of brokers and specialists before the execution was completed. In 1983, that all changed with a dentist in Michigan who made the first online stock transaction using a system developed by what is now E*TRADE Financial.1 \nOnline brokers and easy access to financial data make investing your money as simple as starting a savings account. But in an internet-driven, do-it-yourself world, is investing also a do-it-yourself activity? If so, why not just fire your financial advisor, pay fewer fees to your mutual funds, and set up a portfolio of your own? We look at some of the basics of managing your own money before you actually become your own financial manager. \nKey Takeaways\nThe wealth of information available online may offer inexperienced investors with a false sense of security.\nIt's important to understand modern portfolio theory and risk.\nWatch the market first in order to learn how it works and how it reacts to daily events. \nSet up a virtual paper trading account so you don't lose more money than you should.\nShould You Manage Your Own Money? \nThat first trade, made by William Porter, changed the way investment products are researched, discussed, bought, and sold. Computerized trading has resulted in highly liquid markets, making it easy to buy and sell most securities quickly. The do-it-yourselfer now has access to the same free financial data professionals use. Websites like StockTwits set up entire communities of investors and traders who exchange information in real time.2 \nBut just because it's possible, does that mean managing your own money is a good idea? Professional investors have a saying: \"The stock market is an expensive place to learn how to invest.\" They understand that it's easier to lose money than it is to make money, and because of that, some argue that the wealth of information available to people with an inexperienced financial background may offer a false sense of security. \nTools are only as good as the knowledge and experience of the person using them. Does a high-priced software package used by the world's best composers result in beautiful music? Does the newest innovation in surgical technology make a person with no prior training in the field a top-performing surgeon? \nThere's no doubt that the internet has given the retail investor the tools that they need to effectively manage their own money, but what about the knowledge and experience to use the tools effectively? For an investor who wants to manage their own money, what types of fundamental knowledge should they have before firing their financial adviser? \nModern Portfolio Theory \nIt's important to get a grasp of the modern portfolio theory (MPT) and gain an understanding of how asset allocation is determined for an individual based on their individual factors. In order to gain a true understanding of these principles, you'll have to dig deeper than the top-level internet articles that tell you that MPT is simply understanding allocation. MPT is not just about the allocation, but also its efficiency. The best money managers understand how to position your money for maximum return with the least amount of risk. They also understand that efficiency is highly dynamic as the person ages and their financial picture changes. \nAlong with efficiency comes the dynamic nature of risk tolerance. At certain points in our lives, our risk tolerance may change. Along with retirement, we might have intermediate financial goals like saving for college or starting a new business, the portfolio has to be adjusted to meet those goals. Financial advisors often use proprietary software that produces detailed reports not available to the retail investor. \nUnderstanding Risk \nIn the plethora of free resources available, risk is treated too benignly. The term risk tolerance has been so overused that retail investors may believe that they understand risk if they understand that investing may involve losing money from time to time. But it's not really that simple. In fact, it's much more than that. \nRisk is a behavior that is hard to understand rationally because investors often act against their best interests. A study conducted by Dalbar showed that inexperienced investors tend to buy high and sell low, which often leads to losses in short-term trades.3 \nRisk is hard to understand rationally because investors often act against their best interests.\nSince risk is a behavior, it's extremely difficult for an individual to have an accurate, unbiased picture of their true attitude towards risk. Day traders, often seen as having a high-risk tolerance, may actually have an extremely low tolerance because they're unwilling to hold an investment for longer periods. Great investors understand that success comes with fending off emotion and making decisions based on facts. That's hard to do when you're working with your own money. \nCan You Beat the Market? \nDo you know how likely you are to outperform the overall market? What is the likelihood of any one football player being better than most of the other NFL players, and if they are better for a season what is the likelihood that they will be the best of the best for decades? \nEfficient market hypothesis (EMH) might contain the answer. EMH states that everything known about an investment product is immediately factored into the price. If Intel releases information that sales will be light this quarter, the market will instantly react and adjust the value of the stock. According to EMH, there is no way to beat the market for sustained periods because all prices reflect true or fair value. \nFor the retail investor who tries to pick individual stock names in the hopes of achieving gains that are larger than the market as a whole, this may work in the short term, just as gambling can sometimes produce short-term profits. But over a sustained period of decades, this strategy breaks down, at least, according to the proponents of EMH. \nEven the brightest investment minds employing teams of researchers all over the world haven't been able to beat the market over a sustained period, according to famed investor Charles Ellis in his book, \"Winning The Loser's Game: Timeless Strategies For Successful Investing.\"4 Critics of this theory cite investors like Warren Buffett who consistently beat the market, but what does EMH mean for the individual investor? Before deciding on your investing strategy, you need the knowledge and statistics to back it up. \nIf you're going to pick individual stocks in the hopes that they'll appreciate in value faster than the overall market, what evidence leads you to the idea that this strategy will work? If you're planning to invest in stocks for dividends, is there any evidence that proves that an income strategy works? Would investing in an index fund be the best way? Where can you find the data needed to make these decisions? \nLearning to Invest \nWhat do you do for a living? If you have a college degree, you might be one of the people who say that you didn't become highly skilled as a result of your degree, but instead because of the experience you amassed. When you first started your job were you highly effective from the very beginning? \nBefore managing your own money, you need experience. Gaining experience for investors often means losing money, and losing money in your retirement savings isn't an option. \nExperience comes from watching the market and learning first-hand how it reacts to daily events. Professional investors know that the market has a personality that is constantly changing. Sometimes it's hypersensitive to news events and other times it brushes them off. Some stocks are highly volatile while others have muted reactions. \nThe best way for the retail investor to gain experience is by setting up a virtual or paper trading account. These accounts are perfect for learning to invest while also gaining experience before committing real money to the markets. \nThe Bottom Line \nMany people have found success in managing their own money, but before putting your money at risk, become a student in the art of investing. If somebody wanted to do your job based on what they read on the internet, would you advise it? If you were looking for a financial advisor, would you hire yourself based on your current level of knowledge? \nYou may answer in the affirmative, but until you have the knowledge and experience as a money manager, managing a brokerage account with money that you could stand to lose might be okay, but leave your retirement money to the professionals. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "How to Buy Fractional Shares\nIf you’ve ever wanted to invest in a particular company’s stock, but didn’t have enough money to buy even one share, or you want to effectively diversify your funds, investing in fractional shares through online brokers or robo-advisors might be an affordable way to get started. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a portion, or fraction, of a stock based on a dollar amount that the investor can afford–not based on a particular number of shares. Implementing this type of strategy is propitious for investors who may be starting out with a limited amount of money, but still want to build a diversified portfolio. We’ll take an in-depth look at how investing in fractional shares works and answer the basic questions that investors need to know to get started. \nHow to Buy Fractional Shares \nIn order to buy fractional shares, you will need to open an investment account through either an online broker or a robo-advisor. The main difference between the two is whether you want to have full control over which fractional shares you are investing in, or if you want to have a more hands-off approach. With a robo-advisor, you will be able to set your dollar amount to invest and your investment goals, and based on that, the robo-advisor will choose your fractional share investments and automatically rebalance to keep you within your investment goal range. \nStep 1: Research the fractional shares you want to buy. Fractional share offerings will differ between brokerages, so knowing which stocks you want to be able to invest in via fractional shares can also help determine which brokerage you may want to use. \nStep 2: Open an online broker or robo-advisor account. Not all online brokers or robo-advisors offer fractional shares, so you will need to make sure the company you want to go with offers that service. It is also important to remember that every brokerage has slightly different nuances to the way they offer fractional shares, such as: \nWhich stocks can be bought in fractional shares\nHow trades are executed and settled\nFees\nStep 3: Fund the account. You will need to fund the account once you open it. Many online brokers can be funded via electronic funds transfer, but it still may take a few days for the funds to settle, so you may not be able to invest right away. \nStep 4: Complete and monitor your investment. Most online accounts make it very easy to monitor your portfolio using the main dashboard. Typically, you are able to see all of your account holdings at a glance, but you may also be able to utilize more advanced options, such as setting up stock alerts or automatic rebalancing, depending on what is offered by your particular online brokerage. \nCompare Top Platforms for Investing in Fractional Shares \nIs There a Downside to Fractional Shares? \nWhile there are several benefits to investing in fractional shares, the following drawbacks are also worth considering: \nLimited stock selection: Just because a stock is publicly traded does not mean that you will be able to buy fractional shares of it. Each brokerage has its own curated list of stocks that investors can buy fractional shares of. \nPotential problems transferring fractional shares to a different broker: If you want to transfer your account to another brokerage, you may not be able to transfer the fractional shares. You may need to liquidate any fractional shares in order to transfer. \nProxy voting may not be an option: Again, each firm also handles proxy voting differently regarding fractional shares. Make sure you know your company’s policy on this ahead of time. \nAdditional fees: Some brokerages charge additional fees for fractional share investing. This can potentially decrease profits, especially for low-dollar investment amounts. Find out if there are fees associated with fractional shares and if they are flat fees or a percentage. \nTrade execution may not take place in real time: If the brokerage that you are investing with does not settle your trade in real time, that could affect your cost basis. Some firms will settle all the fractional shares in one or more bulk orders rather than settling each order individually. Obviously, prices can fluctuate throughout a trading day, so understanding how this will be settled is important. \nCan complicate tax returns: Because you are buying fractional shares, and may buy several fractional shares throughout the year, depending on your investment strategy, you may end up holding several different tax lots that may be difficult to match up at tax time. If a stock you own has a dividend that you automatically reinvest, you will have additional tax lots to deal with. \nFactors to Consider When Investing in Fractional Shares \nSelection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Because each online brokerage has its own select list of stocks or ETFs that they offer for fractional share investing, it is important to know this ahead of time. Some firms will offer ETFs, others will not. One company may offer fractional shares of an individual company, while others may not. Be sure to check out each brokerage’s list of fractional share stocks and ETF offerings before opening an account. \nFees and commissions: Some brokerages will be commission-free when it comes to investing in fractional shares, while others may charge additional fees. It is important to find out the brokerage’s policy on this prior to opening an account. \nAccount minimums: Many companies have no account minimum to open or maintain the account. Often, investors can buy fractional shares for as low as $1. Balance and investment minimums will differ from broker to broker. \nResearch amenities: Once you open an account with an online broker or robo-advisor, you will have access to research amenities. Brokers will provide analysts’ assessments of companies, which can help you determine which stocks you’d like to invest in. \nEducational content: Knowing how to invest, what to invest in, and how to reach your financial goals are important. Educational content provided by your brokerage can help you to better understand which investments will help you reach your goals, and even how to better utilize your account amenities to track and monitor your investment. \nFAQs \nWhat Are Fractional Shares?\nFractional shares are very simply a portion, or fraction, of a whole share. When investing in fractional shares, you will buy a portion of a stock share. With this strategy, you are investing based on a dollar amount, not an individual stock’s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing investors to gain market entry sooner. \nWhile the concept of trading in fractional shares has been around since 1999, the strategy really wasn’t widely available—or financially feasible—until 2019. A few low-fee companies offered fractional shares at that time, but this didn’t last very long.1 Around 2019, online brokers cut fees drastically to offer low fees or no monthly fees, thus creating a path for investing in fractional shares to become advantageous. Prior to 2019, your portfolio may have had fractional shares, but it was most likely due to a few, limited circumstances: owning mutual funds, stock splits, dividend reinvestment programs, or company mergers or acquisitions.\nHow Does Fractional Share Investing Work?\nYour experience with investing in fractional shares will differ depending on which brokerage you decide to invest through. Each brokerage has its own guidelines, so finding out exactly what is offered will be important before deciding to invest. \nFor example:\nThe list of stocks will differ from broker to broker, as well as whether it offers EFTs for fractional share investing.\nSome brokers charge additional fees for fractional shares.\nSome brokers may offer fractional share trading in real time, others may settle all fractional share trades in one or more large orders–which could affect share price, depending on how much the stock price fluctuated throughout the day between order time and trade execution time.\nIf you are only buying a fraction of a share, you will also only get a fraction of the dividend, if the stock receives one. For example, if you want to invest in a stock that is trading at $100 per share, you don’t need to have $100 to buy a full share, you can instead invest $25 and own one-fourth of a share. If this same stock happens to get a dividend that is $0.40 per share, you would likewise get one-fourth of the dividend, or $0.10. \nOne online brokerage that offers fractional shares is Charles Schwab. Schwab refers to a fractional share as a “slice.” When buying a Schwab stock slice, investors have the choice to buy slices of 30 stocks in companies on the S&P 500 in one transaction.2 These shares can then be held and sold independently. One way to think of it is like investing in a mutual fund, but you have the flexibility to trade the individual stocks, or stock fractions.\nAre Fractional Shares a Good Idea?\nBuying fractional shares can be beneficial in several ways: affordability, diversification, and dollar cost averaging.\nAffordability: You don’t have to wait until you have hundreds or thousands of dollars in order to buy enough shares of a stock. You can start investing with many online brokerages in fractional shares with only $1. \nDiversification: Investing lower dollar amounts and being able to diversify used to only be available in mutual funds. However, now that many brokerages offer fractional shares, investors can choose which companies they want to invest in, and can trade the fractional shares at any time—unlike a mutual fund, which is bought and sold as a “basket” of stocks. Having the option to only invest in a fractional share allows investors to choose several stocks rather than putting all of their money into just one company in order to purchase a certain amount of whole shares.\nDollar cost averaging: Because investing in fractional shares is an option, investors can choose to pick a specific dollar amount to invest each month, for instance. By investing on a regular basis, investors can take advantage of price fluctuations in the market while also hedging against risk. \nCan You Buy Fractional Shares Through Fidelity?\nYes, you can buy fractional shares through Fidelity. With a minimum account balance of $0, and fractional share investing starting at only $1, Fidelity makes it easy to open an account and start investing in fractional shares. In fact, Investopedia ranks Fidelity as the Best Online Broker for ETFs, so if investing in fractional shares of ETFs is important to you, this company may be a great option. In all, Fidelity offers over 7,000 US stocks and ETFs in which investors can buy fractional shares.3\nDo Fractional Shares Make You Money?\nInvesting in such small dollar amounts may not seem like a way to make money. If you treat this like contributing to an IRA or 401k on a monthly basis, though, your multiple, small investments will add up over time and create a very nice savings account. While one individual purchase is only buying a portion of a stock, or portions of several stocks, investing over months or years will allow those fractional shares to keep building, potentially into several full shares of several stocks.\nCan You Buy Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) as Fractional Shares?\nYes, some companies will offer ETFs as fractional shares. Because each brokerage has different fractional share offerings, it is important to find out if the firm you want to invest with offers ETFs as fractional shares and what other stocks are on its fractional share list.\nAre Fractional Shares Harder to Sell?\nThe answer to this will depend upon how your brokerage handles the selling of fractional shares. Some brokerage firms do not guarantee liquidity of fractional shares. This will differ from broker to broker, so it is something to consider when choosing which firm you want to invest with. Liquidity refers to the ability to easily sell a stock or security and convert to cash. Even though you can buy fractional shares, you may not be able to sell fractional portions as easily as whole shares.4\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "5 Advantages of Investing in Your 20s\nFor many young adults, it seems easier to put off any investing decisions until their financial situation becomes, at least theoretically, more stable. Twenty-somethings, however, are actually in a prime position to enter the investing world, even with college debt and low salaries. \nTime \nWhile money may be tight, young adults do have one thing going for them: time. There is a reason that compounding—the ability to grow an investment by reinvesting the earnings—was referred to by Albert Einstein as \"the eighth wonder of the world.\" The magic of compounding allows investors to generate wealth over time and requires only two things: the reinvestment of earnings and time. \nA single $10,000 investment at age 20 would grow to over $70,000 by the time the investor was 60 years old (based on a 5% interest rate). That same $10,000 investment made at age 30 would yield about $43,000 by age 60, and made at age 40 would yield only $26,000. The longer money is put to work, the more wealth it can generate. \nTake on More Risk \nAn investor's age influences the amount of risk they can withstand. Young people, with years of earning ahead of them, can afford to take on more risk in their investment activities. While individuals reaching retirement years may gravitate towards low-risk or risk-free investments, such as bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs), young adults can build more aggressive portfolios that are subject to more volatility and stand to produce larger gains. \nLearn by Doing \nYoung investors have the flexibility and time to study investing and learn from their successes and failures. Since investing has a fairly lengthy learning curve, young adults are at an advantage because they have years to study the markets and refine their investing strategies. As with the increased risk that can be absorbed by younger investors, so too can they overcome investing mistakes because they have the time needed to recover. \nTech Savvy \nThe younger generation is a tech-savvy one, able to study, research, and apply online investing tools and techniques. Online trading platforms provide countless opportunities for both fundamental and technical analysis, as do chat rooms and financial and educational web sites. Technology, including online opportunities, social media, and apps, can all contribute to a young investor's knowledge base, experience, confidence, and expertise. \nHuman Capital \nHuman capital, from an individual's perspective, can be thought of as the present value of all future wages. Since the ability to earn wages is fundamental to investing and saving for retirement, investing in oneself—by earning a degree, receiving on-the-job training, or learning advanced skills—is a valuable investment that can have strong returns. Young adults often have many opportunities to increase their ability to earn higher future wages, and taking advantage of these opportunities can be considered one of the many forms of investing. \nThe Bottom Line \nSaving for retirement is not the only reason to make well-planned investments. Many investments, such as those made in dividend stocks,1 can provide an income stream throughout the life of the investment. Twenty-somethings have some definitive advantages over those who wait to begin investing, including time, the ability to weather increased risk, and opportunities to increase future wages. Even if you have to start small, it's in your advantage to start early! \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "Defining Your Basic Investing Objectives: What to Factor in\nBasic Investment Objectives: An Overview \nThe options for investing your savings are always increasing but they can all still be categorized according to three fundamental characteristics: safety, income, and growth. The first task of any successful individual investor is to find the correct balance among these three worthy goals. The success of one can come at the expense of the others. \nKey Takeaways\nAn investment can be characterized by three factors: safety, income, and capital growth.\nEvery investor has to select an appropriate mix of these three factors. One will be preeminent.\nThe appropriate mix for you will change over time as your life circumstances and needs change.\nThe best choice is often a mix of all three that meets your needs.\nSafety \nIt's said that there's no such thing as an absolutely safe and secure investment but you can get pretty close. Investing in government-issued securities in stable economic systems is one. U.S.-issued bonds remain the gold standard. You have to envision the collapse of the U.S. government to worry about losing your investment in them. \nAAA-rated corporate bonds are also considered safe. They're issued by large, stable companies. These securities are arguably the best means of preserving your principal while receiving a pre-set rate of interest.1 \nThe risks are similar to those of government bonds. IBM or Costco would have to go bankrupt to warrant worrying about losing money investing in their bonds.\nExtremely safe investments are also found in the money market. Because of increasing risk, these securities include Treasury bills (T-bills), certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper, or bankers' acceptance slips. \nBut safety comes at a price. The returns are very modest compared to the potential returns of riskier investments. This is referred to as \"opportunity risk.\" Those who choose the safest investments may be giving up big gains. \nThere's also interest rate risk to some extent. You could tie your money up in a bond that pays a 1% return then watch as inflation rises to 2%. You've just lost money in terms of real spending power. The very safest investments are short-term instruments, such as three-month and six-month CDs, for this reason. The safest investments pay the least of all in interest.2 \nIncome \nInvestors who focus on income may buy some of the same fixed-income assets that are described above but their priorities shift toward income. They're looking for assets that guarantee a steady income supplement and they may accept a bit more risk to get there. Income is often the priority of retirees who want to generate a stable source of monthly income while keeping up with inflation. \nGovernment and corporate bonds may be in the mix, and an income investor may go beyond the safest AAA-rated choices and go longer than short-term CDs. The ratings are assigned by a rating agency that evaluates the financial stability of the company or government issuing the bond. Bonds that are rated at A or AA are only slightly riskier than AAA bonds but they offer a higher rate of return. BBB-rated bonds carry a medium risk but more income.3 \nYou're in junk bond territory beyond these ratings and the word \"safety\" doesn't apply.\nIncome investors may also buy preferred stock shares or common stocks that historically pay good dividends. \nCapital Growth \nBy definition, capital growth is achieved only by selling an asset. Stocks are capital assets. Barring dividend payments, their owners have to cash them in to realize gains. \nThere are many other types of capital growth assets as well, from diamonds to real estate. They all share some degree of risk to the investor. Selling at less than the price you paid is referred to as a capital loss. \nThe stock markets offer some of the most speculative investments available because their returns are unpredictable. Blue chip stocks are generally considered to be the best of the bunch because many of them are reasonably safe. They offer modest income from dividends and the potential for capital growth over the long term. \nGrowth stocks are for those who can tolerate some ups and downs. These are the fast-growing young companies that may grow up to be Amazons, or they might crash spectacularly. \nThe dividend stars are established companies that may not grow in leaps and bounds but pay steady dividends year after year. \nProfits on stocks offer the advantage of a lower tax rate if they're held for a year or more.4\nMany individual investors avoid stock-picking and go with one or more exchange-traded funds or mutual funds that can give them stakes in a broad selection of stocks. \nOne built-in bonus of stocks is a favorable tax rate. Profits from stock sales are taxed at the capital gains rate if the stocks are owned for at least a year and this is less than the income tax rates paid by most investors. \nSecondary Objectives \nSafety, income, and capital gains are the big three objectives of investing but there are others that should be kept in mind as well. \nTax Minimization \nSome investors pursue tax minimization as a factor in their choices. A highly-paid executive may seek investments with favorable tax treatment to lessen the overall income tax burden. Contributing to an individual retirement account or any other tax-advantaged retirement plan is a highly effective tax minimization strategy. \nLiquidity \nInvestments such as bonds or bond funds are relatively liquid. They can be converted into cash quickly in many cases and with little risk of loss. Stocks are less liquid because they can be sold easily but selling them at the wrong time can cause a serious loss. \nMany other investments are illiquid. Real estate or art can be excellent investments unless you're forced to sell them at the wrong time. \nWhen Do Treasury Bills Mature?\nThe maturity terms of Treasury bills (T-bills) range from four weeks to a maximum of one year. This makes them essentially short-term investments if your goal is to make some money by a time on the near horizon.5\nWhat Is a Junk Bond?\nJunk bonds come with low scores from the primary raters: S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. These scores are typically less than BBB. Junk bonds are inherently risky for investors. They can be tempting because they often pay high interest but they run the risk of default so you could end up losing money despite the interest rate.6\nWhat Are the Capital Gains Tax Rates?\nCapital gains tax rates are favorable if you hold an asset for at least one day more than a year. These are classified as long-term gains and most are taxed at rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%. These rates can be significantly less than your income tax bracket for the year but qualifying for each rate depends on your overall taxable income. Nonetheless, the IRS indicates that most taxpayers fall into the 15% category.4\nYou can be liable for a capital gains tax when you sell an asset for more than you invested in it. You'll want to hold onto a profitable asset for at least one year and one day for more favorable long-term tax treatment. Otherwise, capital gains are taxed along with your other income according to your marginal tax bracket.\nThe Bottom Line \nThe answer doesn't lie in a single choice among safety, growth, or capital gains for most investors. The best choice is a mix of all three that meets your needs. And it will most likely change over time. Your appetite for capital gains may be highest when you're at the start of your career, and you can withstand a lot of risks, but you might prioritize holding onto that nest egg and dialing down the risk as you approach retirement. \nYour portfolio will probably reflect one pre-eminent objective at any stage in life, with all other potential objectives carrying less weight in the overall scheme. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "Trading Hours for the World’s Major Stock Exchanges\nA stock market exchange is a marketplace where stocks are bought and sold daily. It functions as an entity that ensures orderly trading and efficient dissemination of price quotes for the companies that list on the exchange. Trading is generally conducted from Monday through Friday, with exceptions. American investors can access international markets and exchanges online through a brokerage.\nKey Takeaways\nMost of the world’s stock exchanges are open during regular business hours, in local time.\nRegular trading hours for the NYSE and Nasdaq are Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nTrades entered with an online brokerage when the exchange is closed are executed at the open unless otherwise indicated.\nNorth American exchanges closely match the New York timeframe.\nWestend61 / Getty Images\nTrading Hours on Holidays \nHolidays depend on the local calendar, so they differ for every location. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closes on July 4 for U.S. Independence Day. The Singapore Stock Exchange closes in early February for the Chinese New Year.1 \nSome exchanges close for a half day from time to time. The NYSE is open only until 1 p.m. on Christmas Eve. The London Stock Exchange has a two-minute break at noon daily.23 \nNote\nWhile most exchanges operate Monday through Friday, the Saudi Exchange is open from Sunday to Thursday.4\nTrading Hours on North American Exchanges \nTrading in North America is generally based on the Eastern time zone no matter where the exchange is located. The exception is the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), which posts its hours in Central time but adjusts its hours to match those of the NYSE. \nThe headquarters of the trading exchanges are in New York City, Toronto, and Mexico City. The westernmost time zone is Mexico City, with the BMV trading within business hours of Central Standard Time (CST). However, even though the BMV trades on CST, the hours mirror those of the NYSE, so, all things considered, trading is open during the same time frame. \nRegular trading hours for the NYSE and Nasdaq are Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.52 \nAn alternative for investors in foreign stocks is to trade American depositary receipts (ADRs), which trade on U.S. exchanges and in U.S. dollars. \nTrading Hours in Asia and the Mideast \nThere are 11 time zones across Asia and its immediate neighbors, but fortunately, they roughly synchronize their exchange hours to create a good deal of overlap for the sake of trade and liquidity.6 \nSome Asian markets, including the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE/TYO), take a break for lunch.78 \nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange has numerous market holidays each year, including an extended hiatus for the Chinese New Year. \nOn Jan. 22, 2024, India’s stock market capitalization surpassed Hong Kong’s for the first time, making India the fourth-largest equity market globally. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the combined value of shares reached $4.33 trillion on the exchanges in India, beating the $4.29 trillion in Hong Kong.9\nTrading Hours in the U.K. and Europe \nEurope, like Asia, has many individual exchanges. The largest stock exchange organization in Europe is Euronext, a pan-European exchange that operates in seven countries and has its headquarters in Amsterdam.1011 \nTrading Hours in South America \nThe largest exchange in South America is in São Paulo, Brazil: B3 Brazil Bolsa Balcao. The exchange trades from 10 a.m. to 4:55 p.m., and as São Paulo is one hour ahead of New York City, it trades approximately the same hours as the NYSE and Nasdaq. Stocks, commodities, and options are traded on the São Paulo exchange.1213 \nTrading Hours in Africa \nThe largest stock exchange in Africa is in Johannesburg, South Africa. Egypt, Mauritius, and Nigeria have smaller exchanges.14 \nThe Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) acquired the South Africa Futures Exchange and the Bond Exchange of South Africa, so all of those assets are traded on the JSE.15 \nThe Johannesburg exchange is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. South African Standard Time (SAST), with no lunch break.16 \nTrading Hours in Australia/Oceania \nThe Sydney-based Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is roughly the same size as the South African exchange. The ASX merged with the Sydney Futures Exchange in 2006. Bonds and derivatives also are traded on the ASX. The market opens later than most, at 10 a.m. local time, and there is no lunch break.1718 \nWhat's the Difference Between a Stock Exchange and the Stock Market?\nA stock exchange is a marketplace or infrastructure that facilitates equity trading. The exchange is founded and managed by a corporation, private or public. It allows companies to list their stocks in its marketplace. The term “stock market” refers more generally to stocks, or a group of stocks in a particular region, industry, or sector.\nWhich Major Stock Exchanges Are Closed During Lunch?\nThe major stock exchanges with an official lunch close are the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE/TYO), the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK).192087\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) has a two-minute break at noon. Its traders don’t eat that fast. The mini-break protects institutional traders from high-frequency traders, whose split-second transactions can skew prices.3\nWhat Times Are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Open?\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq are open during the same hours, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time. Both publish annual calendars of their holidays and half days.25\nThe Bottom Line \nMost global stock exchanges are open during business hours Monday through Friday, except the Saudi stock exchange, which is open Sunday through Thursday. All exchanges publish a calendar of closures and breaks for holidays or lunch on their websites. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

They need access to high-quality stock screeners to do that. The best stock screeners combine ease of use with flexibility without sacrificing data accuracy or quantity. The best screeners have a broad range of stocks in their databases that can be filtered with precision using both preset and custom criteria. The interface should be intuitive, even for beginners. \nCompare the Best Stock Screeners \nGuide for Choosing the Best Stock Screener\nWhat Is a Stock Screener?\nA stock screener is an essential tool used by stock traders and investors to sift through thousands of stocks so they can find those that best meet their criteria. Users can apply any number of filters based on fundamental and technical metrics to narrow down their lists. The more robust the screening filters, the more quickly the screener can find you a match. \nUsers can also apply their own customized criteria to find a more precise match. The screener will instantly display the results in the categories you choose when criteria are applied. Stock screeners are used to identify stocks based on different investing scenarios, such as creating an asset allocation strategy, long-term buy-and-hold strategies, or day trading in and out of the market for quick returns. \nWhat Should You Look for in a Stock Screener?\nA good stock screener is well organized and easy to use, enabling you to find the filters you need and start the process with a few clicks. It's essential to use a stock screener with a wide range of filters and the ability to quickly sort through your results so you can drill down further. You should look for a stock screener most suited to your investing style. Some are ideally suited for day trading, while others are more appropriate for long-term investing. \nKeep in mind that some stock screeners only follow U.S. stock exchanges, while others have a global reach. Additional must haves include accurate data. Always check to ensure the data comes from a reputable and reliable source. Another feature to consider is ensuring the screener can save your screens. Otherwise, you'll have to continually re-enter your criteria, which can be time consuming. \nBest Free Stock Screeners \nUtilizing premium stock screeners can give investors a sizable edge when trading in the market. Premium stock screeners are the way to go when it comes to getting the most out of a larger selection of tools and data. However, some of these high-profile screeners come with a learning curve as well as costs that are simply too high for inexperienced traders to justify. Below are some of the best free screeners novice traders can use while learning the ropes of trading. \nZacks (Nasdaq) \nZacks is the best free option for stock screeners. Beginning traders will find that they will be equipped with everything they need to research the stock market and execute timely trades. When traders are ready to upgrade to the premium version, they can easily do so without changing to another platform. \nFinviz \nFinviz is an excellent stock screening platform, but there is a learning curve that traders must overcome. The platform is a good stepping stone for traders to understand how complex screeners operate and the amount of information that traders will need to cipher before spending money on a premium stock screener. \nTradingView \nTradingView is another excellent option that traders can use before committing to a premium stock screener. The free version of TradingView offers an exceptional stock screener and a wide range of free indicators and market analyses that traders will appreciate. However, this stock screener might also have a learning curve for newer traders, but once traders get the hang of the platform, they can start considering upgrading, which is easy to manage. \nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia collected vital data points for 30 companies offering stock screeners to identify the most essential factors. We used this data to review each screener for associated costs, functionality, available chart patterns, and other features to provide an unbiased, comprehensive review to ensure our readers decide on the right stock screener. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best best stock screeners since 2021. \nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow Do You Use a Stock Screener?\nStock screeners are relatively straightforward. After opening the screener, you choose the filters you want to use based on specific criteria, such as price, trading volume, price-to-earnings ratio, volatility, chart patterns, and other fundamental or technical metrics. You can layer on more filters until you get the results you want to further narrow down your choices.\nDoes Google Have a Stock Screener?\nGoogle removed its stock screener in 2022 and replaced it with a more basic tool, eliminating many key features. Investors needing a stock screener with advanced features will want to find one that aligns with their trading style and fits their budget.24\nWhat Are the Different Types of Stock Screeners?\nInvestors who actively trade on the market will find that there are several stock screeners to choose from. Although a good stock screener will be able to handle a wide range of demands, certain stock screeners are better equipped to handle different trading styles. For instance, there are stock screeners that focus on day trading, swing trading, and option trading. If traders do not adhere to a particular style, they can reap the benefits of a free stock screener either from an external screener or their preferred brokerage. \nBest Stock Screeners for Beginners\nStock screeners can be a complex tool to learn and understand, especially for new traders. While having the best and most up-to-date screeners in trading is always nice, that level of sophistication will require a high degree of comprehension for these tools to work as intended. Keep in mind that aside from the intricate nature of screeners, they are costly.\nA beginner will want to find a screener that is not only cost-effective but one that can gradually introduce the trader to how a stock screener works. The stock screener that we feel fits this criteria is Zacks. It offers a free stock screener with the option to upgrade to better versions when you are ready.\nDo Stock Screeners Work for ETFs?\nYes, most stock screeners can screen for Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), but if you are an investor and are focused solely on ETF investing, then you may want to look for an ETF screener designed specifically for ETFs; Finviz not only has such capabilities but also allows ETF investors to use its screener free of charge.25\nHow We Find the Best Stock Screeners \nOur initial search revealed 30 stock screeners for our consideration. We narrowed the list to 16 by running them through our criteria of ease of use, selection of fundamental and technical filters, depth of filter criteria, customization, and extra functionality. After a more rigorous comparison, we identified the best stock screeners in six distinct categories. \nLearn More About Stock Screeners \nWhat Is a Stock Screener?\nHow Stock Screeners Work?\nHow To Use a Stock Screener\nHow To Set Up Trading Screens\n4 Steps To Picking a Stock\nBest Stock-Picking Advice for New Investors\n4 Steps To Picking A Stock\nInvestopedia Trading Simulator\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

  "text": "How to Automate Your Investing\nAutomated investing might be the smartest way to simplify wealth-building. By automating your investing you’re less likely to miss funds as they are withdrawn from your paycheck and transferred directly into your 401(k) or an investment account. From beginners to sophisticated options traders, automated investing is a crucial strategy to compound investment growth. We’ve designed this guide to help you explore the ways to automate your investing from simply reinvesting dividends to regular transfers into a robo-advisor. \nHow to Automate Your Investing \nIt’s usually quick and easy to automate your investing. Before setting up the account, review the platform’s FAQ pages for the range of account minimums and potential approvals needed to open an automated investing account. Each platform will have its own process. Next, gather your bank account and personal information, such as your Social Security number. The investment account platform will walk you through the process step-by-step. \nHere’s what you can expect when setting up your automated investing account: \nCreate an investment account: Account setup involves choosing a user ID and password for the account. Then you’ll select the type of account you prefer, such as a taxable investment or IRA account. Advanced traders that look to use leverage in their swing trading may first need approval to open certain brokerage accounts.\nChoose your assets: With robo-advisors and micro-investing apps, you’ll answer several questions about your goals, comfort with risk, and time horizon, and the platform will select the assets for you. Workplace retirement accounts provide a list of investments from which to choose, while self-directed investment accounts offer thousands of stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. Frequently, you’ll find helpful articles to help you choose your investments on the website’s educational section. \nLink your funding account: This is where you choose the checking or savings account for the fund transfer. For this step you’ll need the name of the financial institution, your bank’s routing number, and your account number. With a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 account, this step is unnecessary, as money is automatically transferred from your paycheck into the retirement account. \nSet your funding schedule: For robo-advisors, round-up apps, and self-directed accounts, you’ll select how frequently and how much money you wish to transfer from your bank account into the automated investment account. With your workplace retirement account, make sure to set up a large enough transfer to receive the employer match. Also, understand the maximum contribution limit into your 401(k). \nBest Automated Investing Platforms \nUnderstand the Top Automated Investment Types \nYou can set up an automated investment plan in a variety of ways. From robo-advisors to your employer 401(k), we’ll give you the rundown. Choose one or more automated investment types to ensure that you are converting today’s earnings into wealth for tomorrow. \nRobo-advisors: Robo-advisors such as Wealthfront, Betterment, Fidelity Go, and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios provide a low-fee option for smart investing. You inform the robo-advisor of your goals and timeline and the digital investment manager will create an investment portfolio that meets your needs. Set up an auto transfer into the account, either taxable or retirement, and the robo-advisor keeps your investments allocated according to your preferences. Some robo-advisors offer other services, including access to human financial advisors.\nEmployer-sponsored retirement accounts: Most employers provide a way for you to save for retirement through a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 account. You choose a percentage of your paycheck to transfer into the account. Some employers also include an additional matching contribution, up to a specific percentage. The money is invested in stock, bond, or balanced funds that you select. While in the account, your money grows without being taxed. \nDividend reinvestment plans (DRIP): A DRIP is an option within your investment account to have all of your dividends and capital gains payments automatically reinvested in the same asset. By reinvesting your investment income into additional shares, your account value will compound more quickly. \nRecurring transfer: You can direct your bank to have a specific amount of money regularly transferred from checking or savings into your investment account. The funds can be automatically transferred into taxable investment, retirement, and any financial account on a daily, weekly, monthly, or other recurring schedule. Make sure to avoid overdrawing the linked account.\nRounding up: Acorns and other round-up micro saving and investing apps allow you to link a debit and/or credit card to the app. After linking, select a round-up amount from the next dollar, up to 10 times the original amount.1 Whenever you spend with that card, the round-up amount will automatically be transferred into your investment account. \nWhat You Need to Open an Automated Investing Account \nFirst, find out what information is required to open an automated investing account. \nPersonal Information \nThe personal information and documentation required to complete the onboarding process typically includes:2 \nName\nSocial Security number (or taxpayer identification number)\nAddress\nTelephone number\nEmail address\nDate of birth\nDriver's license, passport information, or information from other government-issued identification\nEmployment status and occupation\nWhether you are employed by a brokerage firm\nAnnual income\nNet worth\nInvestment objectives and risk tolerance\nMinimum Deposits \nFortunately for investors, there are many automated investment accounts with low-minimum deposit requirements. Minimum deposits can range from zero for many well-known investment brokerage firms up to $100,000 for the comprehensive Empower robo-advisor, which also includes access to certified financial planners.3 \nIf you are new to investing and just starting out, you might open your automated investing account at a major brokerage firm that doesn’t require a minimum investment, such as Fidelity Go. Or, if you’re seeking a robo-advisor with low minimums, SoFi Automated Investing, M1 Finance, Betterment, Ally, and Ellevest all require $100 or less to get started. \nFactors to Consider When Opening an Automated Investing Account \nWith so many choices about how to automate investing, it can be confusing to narrow down your selection. To make the decision easier, evaluate these factors: \nCustomer service: Phone customer service can be very important for both new and experienced investors. Be aware that some platforms do not offer live customer service. If talking to a human matters to you, then look into live customer service availability and contact times. \nFees and commissions: Research from Vanguard and other firms has shown a direct correlation between lower fees and higher investment performance.4 Before investing with any platform, understand the fees you’ll be paying, including management fees and fund expense ratios. Determine whether the services you’re receiving are worth the fees. \nAccount minimum: Investigate how much money you’ll need to open the account as well as maintain it. Determine whether there is a minimum balance requirement and if it is suitable for your financial situation. \nResearch tools: For self-directed investment accounts, carefully review the screeners, calculators, trading platforms, and research report availability. If you’re a self-directed investor, make certain, before opening an account, that the research tools match up with your needs. \nWhat Is Automated Investing?\nAutomated investing is a strategy to ensure that you regularly save and invest for the future. We all have the tendency to forget to implement our best intentions. New Year's resolutions are frequently forgotten by February. Automated investing pre-programs our behavior to put investing for the future first.\nAutomated investing is best for anyone interested in converting today's earnings into tomorrow's prosperity. This strategy works when saving for retirement, a child's college education, general wealth-building, and saving for any goal that is more than five years in the future. \nThe automated investment concept involves implementing a few simple steps. First, select a paycheck, personal checking, or savings account from which the investment funds will be drawn. Next, choose where you want to invest. The choices include your workplace retirement account, a self-directed investment account, a micro-investing app, or a robo-advisor. Reinvesting your dividends and capital gains within your brokerage account is also considered automated investing. Pick the specific investments, and then set up a regular transfer from the cash account into the investment account. \nFinally, you choose the amount and frequency of your auto investment strategy. Once the plan is enacted, your money will automatically transfer into the designated accounts and investments. That way, when markets go down, you’ll be less tempted to stop investing, because the entire process is automated. In fact, when markets go down, you’ll be set up to benefit from one of the best investment tenets: “Buy low.”\nHow Does Automated Investing Work?\nThink of automated investing like automated bill pay. You set up the parameters, such as amount to be invested, the investment vehicles, and the funding method. After setup, regular transfers from your bank account or paycheck go directly to your investment accounts. This automates the contributions to your investment account. If you have a self-directed account, you may have another step to them put that money to work. Often this can be eliminated if you are buying into pre-built portfolios offered by your brokerage. You can also automate the investment portfolio through a robo-advisor where the contributions will automatically be invested according to the allocations and rules that were created as part of your account setup.\nIs Automated Investing a Good Idea?\nAutomated investing is a good idea for nearly everyone. Behavioral finance research suggests that we are not always rational decision-makers.5 By helping you overcome less optimal investment behavior, such as irregular investing or avoiding investment, automated investing can improve your long-term financial success. Automated investing removes money from your account before you can spend it and diverts it into long-term financial assets, leading to wealth-building,\nIs Automated Investing Risky?\nInvesting in financial markets is risky in that the value of your initial investment can decline. In fact, automated investing might be considered less risky than do-it-yourself investing. By regularly deploying money into the financial markets during both up and down markets, you are practicing dollar-cost-averaging. This ensures that you will buy more shares when prices are lower and fewer shares when prices are higher. This is the “buy low” recommendation in action.\nAre Micro-Investing Apps a Good Choice?\nMicro-investing apps have their pros and cons. The benefit of these round-up investment apps is that you can get started and continue investing regularly. The disadvantage is that if you only invest your spare change and do not set up a larger automated deposit into the app, it will take you a long time to build a substantial account balance. \nFor example, assume that monthly, you invest $50 in spare change into your investment account, which earns an average 7% per year. After 10 years, that account will be worth $8,704. Now add in a $350 monthly auto deposit in addition to the $50 spare change investment and you’re investing $400 per month. With an average 7% annual return, your account will grow to roughly $69,637 in 10 years.\nShould I Use an Automated Investing Platform?\nYes, there are multiple reasons to use an automated investing platform.\nAutomated investing removes the tendency to under-invest for the future.\nAutomated investing saves time. \nRobo-advisors provide excellent pre-made, set-it-and-forget-it investment portfolios.\nWorkplace retirement accounts offer automated investment into a variety of assets and free money with the employer match.\nDividend reinvestment answers the question of what to do with capital gains and income payments.\nAnyone serious about planning for their future would be wise to consider setting up automated investment strategies. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "How to Invest in Web 3.0 in 2024\nThe internet has connected the world in more ways than any other technology. With people getting more concerned about their data and privacy, however, the internet in its current state seems inadequate. There are serious concerns over how big companies handle and monetize user data, creating the need for a better or alternative internet. Web 3.0 is an alternative that is becoming popular because it puts the internet's power back into the hands of end users. We’ve answered common questions around Web 3.0 investments in this guide, in a way any beginner investor can understand. \nHow to Invest in Web 3.0 \nWeb 3.0 offers investors different investment vehicles that can cater to different risk appetites. Nevertheless, just like every form of investment, investing in Web3 is risky and should only be done with adequate research and a good strategy. \nThe most common Web3 investment options are stocks, cryptos, and NFTs. However, there are also less popular investment methods you can consider, such as angel investing or buying into the IDO (Initial DEX Offering) or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of a crypto company. In both methods, you invest in a company by participating in a seed round or buying its coin before launch. \nOne thing to note is that most of Web3 investing is based on narratives: investors spreading the word on what a company is doing to grow the Web3 ecosystem. However, you shouldn’t depend on narratives when making decisions.That’s because some Web3 influencers push a good narrative about a project to get people to buy into the project, and then they end up dumping the project. Instead, focus on investments with a reasonable historic performance, like these three options. \nInvest in Stocks Involved With Web 3.0 \nStocks are one of the easiest ways to get into Web3, especially as they give you some level of Web3 exposure. Several companies actively involved in Web3 are Web2 companies with multiple sources of income, and so might not be affected by a Web3 downturn like these Web3 stocks: \nCoinbase (COIN): Coinbase is the top Web3 stock for anyone looking to invest in Web3. The American crypto exchange serves as a key stakeholder in the crypto ecosystem, facilitating the conversion of crypto to fiat, and offering an all-inclusive wallet that supports NFTs.1\nMeta (META): Meta might have raised dust when it changed its name from Facebook, but it’s still an important player in the Web3 space. Currently, Meta is building two Metaverses: Horizon Worlds and Workplace, for gaming and co-working, respectively.2\nApple (APPL): Apple is planning to launch augmented reality (AR) glasses to help people experience the Metaverse better and might even let users install third-party apps in a bid to encourage Web3 adoption. Currently, it has integrated a lot of AR features in selected devices.3\nX (formerly Twitter): X is the preferred social platform for Web3 conversations. With founder Elon Musk being an open supporter of Dogecoin, X's stock might be a good buy.4 Additionally, X supports NFT integration and allows people to specially display their NFTs as profile pictures.\nBest Online Brokers \nInvest in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) \nNFTs are unique digital assets on a blockchain. They show ownership and cannot be copied. You can buy an NFT from a secondary marketplace such as OpenSea or Magic Eden or choose to mint them and hold for a profit. \nNFTs are important Web3 investments because they can be used to unlock special privileges or as an investment in a Web3 company. \nInvest in Cryptocurrencies \nCryptocurrencies are digital currencies operated by a decentralized entity on the blockchain. Like regular money, crypto can be used to pay for goods and services and as an investment option. Crypto allows direct exposure into the space and is a good fit for people who want to aggressively invest in Web 3.0 \nCrypto is highly volatile. So, if you’re a risk-averse trader, you might want to consider other lower-risk options like crypto ETFs and fractional shares. These options provide you with direct exposure but cushion you from the market's daily volatility. \nBest Cryptocurrency Exchanges \nKnow the Risks of Investing in Web 3.0 \nWeb 3.0 investments, like any other investment, poses some risk to investors. The biggest risks are volatility, security, and reliability on existing Web3 investment processes and infrastructures. \nVolatility: Prices of Web3 assets change widely over short periods, which could be a huge plus or minus for your portfolio, depending on the time and market demand.\nSecurity: Smart contracts issues, security breaches, and hacks are common occurrences in Web3. If a project is attacked, it could lead to a big loss of your capital. As a safety measure, go with projects that have undergone a full audit.\nReliability: The best Web3 investments are not always reliable. Your best bet would be to go for projects with strong real-world use cases over hype. \nWhy Invest in Web 3.0 \nThe foundation of Web3 is built on emerging technologies such as blockchain tech, smart contracts, and AI. An investment into Web3 positions gives you the chance to be an early adopter of these disruptive technologies. \nWeb3 has the potential to overturn how we do almost everything, from shopping to payments to the way we consume content. As an investment class, Web3 will shape how companies will raise startup capital and generate money from their funding rounds. \nMost importantly, investment in Web3 is largely profitable and can provide impressive returns over shorter time frames. \nTo get the most out of any Web3 investment, you must: \nUse a secure wallet to store digital assets like cryptos and NFTs.\nNever share the PIN/password to your wallet.\nAvoid projects with little or no social media presence and vague roadmaps.\nNever open unofficial links or claim \"free giveaways.\"\nFactors to Consider When Investing in Web 3.0 \nInvesting in Web3 can be challenging, especially if you don’t have a clear plan or failed to do your research. It’s essential you consider these factors before you make a Web3 investment: \nYour investment goals\nThe team behind a project or company\nYour risk tolerance levels\nWeb3 regulations in your country of residence\nAfter you have clearly designed and mapped out your investment goals and the investment timeline, you need to know the founders behind the Web3 project of interest. Choose projects with publicly known founders. You can easily reach out in case the project goes south. Assess your risk tolerance level and go for a project allowed in your country to avoid legal issues with your investment. \nFAQs \nWhat Is Web 3.0?\nWeb 3.0 (or Web3) is a general name for the new, user-centric version of the internet that integrates new concepts like decentralization, blockchain tech, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) into everyday internet use. It is a decentralized version of the internet that promises to help users better control their data usage and sharing while enhancing monetization and reducing exposure to data manipulation.\nThe concept of Web3 is not to make our current internet obsolete; it’s to integrate these technologies into the existing infrastructure, allowing everyone to freely use the internet. For example, if you make a Facebook or Instagram post that goes against Meta’s community standards, the social media giant could take the post down or ban your account. This would likely be impossible in Web 3.0 since most platforms will be decentralized.5\nAlthough it is still a work in progress, many individuals, companies, and even governments have started to position themselves adequately for web3. The Hong Kong government is preparing to adopt a framework for integrating this technology into many of its city's processes.6 \nSince Gavin Wood coined the term in 2014, Web3 has grown to offer potential for diverse opportunities.7 In recent years, there have been lots of conversations around Web3 and the opportunities it offers investors. While Web3 investment opportunities have become an industry buzzword, many have yet to realize its importance and how they can invest before it officially launches.\nCan You Invest Directly In Web 3.0?\nNo. You cannot invest directly in Web 3.0, but you can choose to be an active or passive investor through a variety of investment options. Active investment options include cryptocurrency and NFTs, while passive investment options involve buying stocks in companies actively engaged in Web 3.0.\nWhat’s the Difference Between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0?\nWeb 2.0 is the current internet, which has birthed innovations like social media, e-commerce stores, and search engines. These innovations have made content king and provided a way to create content, unlike in Web 1.0, where internet users could only access limited information. Although beneficial, these Web 2.0 innovations introduced data and privacy issues, giving tech giants access to tons of user data.\nWeb 3.0 is an upgrade to Web 2.0 and offers a way for internet users to control their data, use decentralized technologies to store and share information, and voluntarily conceal their digital identities. In Web 3.0, users will make faster and cheaper payments for goods and services using cryptocurrencies. With Metaverse development currently underway, Web3 could change how we experience the world around us, opening us to more immersive experiences e.g the Metaverse.\nIs Investing in Web 3.0 Safe?\nWeb 3.0 investment options are more volatile than regular investment options. Although not completely unsafe, there is a big risk of ending up on the wrong side of the volatility. This is why it’s critical to have a good level of knowledge, do your research, and come up with a robust investment plan.\nAnother issue of concern is in regards to the current state of regulations. This new technology is still very much unregulated, and governments and regulating bodies could institute policies unfavorable to investors.\nWho Should Invest in Web 3.0?\nWeb 3.0 investing is not for all types of investors, especially those with a low-risk appetite or who are looking to get into investing gradually. It is a fast-moving investment class that requires some level of industry knowledge, patience, and timing. The nature of Web 3 investments makes them a good fit for investors who fall into any of the categories below.\nHigh-Risk Tolerance \nInvesting in Web 3.0 is highly risky. As a Web3 investor, you should have a huge risk appetite and only put in money you can afford to lose. The volatility of many Web 3 assets makes it a highly unpredictable asset class. \nFor example, between February 20, 2023, and March 10, 2023, Bitcoin rose to $24,500 and plummeted to $19,500 before touching $30k.8 Without a huge risk appetite, you could prematurely sell your investments and make constant losses.\nHigh Capital \nTo make tangible returns on your Web 3.0 investment, you need to put in a significant sum of money. Since it is recommended that you use not more than 10% of your entire portfolio to make Web3 investments, you need to have a diversified portfolio that is not fully reliant on this investment class. A higher capital investment would yield more returns but could also translate into more losses. Consider investing in leveraged assets and futures trading if you have a big risk appetite but limited capital.\nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "Economic Indicators You Should Know for Investment\nEconomic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Consistent in their release, wide in their scope and range, metrics such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and written reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze.12 Policymakers, most notably those at the Federal Reserve, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going, but how fast it's getting there.3 \nAlthough investors should get to know economic indicators, the reports are admittedly often dry and the data is raw. In other words, information needs to be put into context before it can be helpful in making any decisions regarding investments and asset allocation. But there is valuable information in those raw data releases. The various government and nonprofit groups that conduct the surveys and release the reports do a very good job of collating and cohesively presenting what would be logistically impossible for any one investor to do by themselves. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns, both of which can be very useful to individual investors. \nWhat Is an Economic Indicator? \nIn its simplest form, an indicator could be considered any piece of information that can help an investor decipher what is going on in the economy. The U.S. economy is essentially a living thing where, at any given moment, there are billions of moving parts—some acting, others reacting. This simple truth makes predictions extremely difficult. They must always involve a large number of assumptions, no matter what resources are put to the task. But with the help of a wide range of economic indicators, investors are able to gain a better understanding of various economic conditions. There are also indexes for coincident indicators and lagging indicators—the components of each are based on whether they tend to rise during or after an economic expansion. \nUse in Tandem, Use in Context \nOnce an investor understands how various indicators are calculated and their relative strengths and limitations, several reports can be used in conjunction to make for more thorough decision making. For example, in the area of employment, consider using data from several releases. By using the hours-worked data (from the Employment Cost Index) along with the labor report and nonfarm payrolls, investors can get a fairly complete picture of the state of the labor market.4 \nAdditionally, are increasing retail sales figures being validated by increased personal expenditures? Are new factory orders leading to higher factory shipments and higher durable goods figures? Are higher wages showing up in higher personal income figures? The savvy investor will look up and down the supply chain to find validation of trends before acting on the results of any one indicator release. \nPersonalizing Your Research \nSome people may prefer to understand a couple of specific indicators really well and use this expert knowledge to make investment plays based on their analyses. Others may wish to adopt a jack-of-all-trades approach, understanding the basics of all the indicators without relying on any one too much. For example, a retired couple living on a combination of pensions and long-term Treasury bonds should be looking for different things than a stock trader who rides the waves of the business cycle. Most investors fall in the middle, hoping for stock market returns to be steady and near long-term historical averages (about 8% to 10% per year). \nKnowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful, as well as generally knowing the macroeconomic forecasts. Forecast numbers can be found at several public websites, such as Yahoo! Finance or MarketWatch. On the day a specific indicator release is made, there will be press releases from newswires such as the Associated Press and Reuters, which will present figures with key pieces highlighted. \nIt is helpful to read a report on one of the newswires, which may parse the indicator data through the filters of analyst expectations, seasonality figures, and year-over-year results. For those that use investment advisors, these individuals will probably analyze recently released indicators in an upcoming newsletter or discuss them during upcoming meetings. \nInflation Indicators: Keeping a Watchful Eye \nMany investors, especially those who invest primarily in fixed-income securities, are concerned about inflation. Current inflation, how strong it is, and what it could be in the future are all vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. There are several indicators that focus on inflationary pressure. The most notable in this group are the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).5 Many investors will use the PPI to try and predict the upcoming CPI. \nThere is a proven statistical relationship between the two, as economic theory suggests that if producers of goods are forced to pay more in production, some portion of the price increase will be passed on to consumers. Each index is derived independently, but both are released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Other key inflationary indicators include the levels and growth rates of the money supply and the Employment Cost Index (ECI).67 \nEconomic Output: Stock Investors Inquire Within \nThe gross domestic product (GDP) may be the most important indicator out there, especially to equity investors who are focused on corporate profit growth. Since the GDP represents the sum of what our economy is producing, its growth rate is targeted to be in certain ranges. If the numbers start to fall outside those ranges, fear of inflation or recession will grow in the markets. To get ahead of this fear, many people will follow the monthly indicators that can shed some light on the quarterly GDP report. \nFor example, capital goods shipments from the Factory Orders Report are used to calculate producers' durable equipment orders within the GDP report.8 Indicators such as retail sales and current account balances are also used in the computations of GDP, so their release helps to complete part of the economic puzzle prior to the quarterly GDP release.9 \nOther indicators that aren't part of the actual calculations for GDP are still valuable for their predictive abilities. Metrics such as wholesale inventories, the Beige Book, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), and the labor report all shed light on how well our economy is functioning. With the assistance of all these monthly data, GDP estimates will begin to tighten up as the component data slowly gets released throughout the quarter. By the time the actual GDP report is released, there will be a general consensus of the figure that is remarkably accurate. If the actual results deviate much from the estimates, the markets will move, often with high volatility. If the number falls right into the middle of the expected range, then the markets and investors can collectively pat themselves on the back and let prevailing investing trends continue. \nMark Your Calendar \nSometimes indicators take on a more valuable role because they contain very timely data. The Institute for Supply Management's PMI report, for instance, is typically released on the first business day of every month.10 As such, it is one of the first pieces of aggregate data available for the month that just ended. While not as rich in detail as many of the indicators to follow, the category breakdowns are often picked apart for clues to things such as future labor report details (from the employment survey results) or wholesale inventories (inventory survey). \nThe relative order in which the indicators are presented does not change month to month, so investors may want to mark a few days on their monthly calendars to read up on the areas of the economy that might change how they think about their investments or time horizon.11 Overall, asset allocation decisions can fluctuate over time, and making such changes after a monthly review of macro indicators may be wise. \nThe Bottom Line \nBenchmark pieces of economic indicator data arrive with no agenda or sales pitch. The data just is, and that is hard to find these days. By becoming knowledgeable about the whats and whys of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the stock market and the economy in which their dollars are invested, and they can also be better prepared to revisit an investment thesis when the timing is right. While there is no one \"magic indicator\" that can dictate whether to buy or sell, using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter portfolio management for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "Bonds: How They Work and How To Invest\nWhat Is a Bond? \nA bond is a fixed-income instrument and investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a certain interest rate for an amount of time. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond. \nBonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower. \nKey Takeaways\nA bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate or coupon to debtholders.\nBond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice-versa.\nBonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default.\nInvestopedia / Ellen Lindner\nHow Bonds Work \nBonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure.12 Corporations often borrow to grow their business, buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees.1 \nBonds are fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be paid back. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer.3 The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate.4 \nThe initial price of most bonds is typically set at par or $1,000 face value per individual bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures.5 \nMarkets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individuals—long after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date.\nCharacteristics of Bonds \nFace value or Par Value: The value of the bond at maturity and the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments.\nCoupon Rate: The rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage.4\nCoupon Dates: The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments.\nMaturity Date: The date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.\nIssue Price: The price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In many cases, bonds are issued at par.\nBond Categories \nThere are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms. \nCorporate Bonds: Companies issue corporate bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates.\nMunicipal Bonds: Issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors.\nGovernment Bonds: Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called “Bills,” bonds issued with one–10 years to maturity are called “notes,” and government bonds issued with more than 10 years to maturity are called “bonds.” The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as \"treasuries.\"\nAgency Bonds: Issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are considered agency bonds.1\nBond Prices and Interest Rates \nA bond's price changes daily where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bond’s price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa.5 \nThe issuer of a fixed-rate bond promises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a $1,000 par, 10% annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder $100 each year.5 If prevailing market interest rates are also 10% at the time that this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return $100. However, if interest rates drop to 5%, the investor can only receive $50 from the government bond but would still receive $100 from the corporate bond. \nInvestors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environment—in this case, the bond will trade at $2,000 so that the $100 coupon represents 5%. Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15%, then an investor could make $150 from the government bond and would not pay $1,000 to earn just $100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case to a price of $666.67.\nYield-to-Maturity (YTM) \nThe yield-to-maturity (YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate. \nYTM is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled.6 YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate. \nYTM. \nInvestopedia\nInvestors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1% change in interest rates.7 This practical definition is the modified duration of a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nHow To Invest in Bonds \nWhile there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and TIPS are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via its TreasuryDirect website. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds. Investors can also take a look at Investopedia's list of the best online stock brokers. \nImage by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia 2020\nBond Variations \nThe bonds available for investors come in many different varieties, depending on the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes. \nZero-Coupon Bonds (Z-bonds): Do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. U.S. Treasury bills are zero-coupon bonds.8\nConvertible Bonds: Debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock (equity) at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price.9\nCallable Bonds: Have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond can be “called” back by the company before it matures. A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value.10\nPuttable Bonds: allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured.11 This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders.\nWhat Determines a Bond's Coupon Rate?\nTwo features of a bond—credit quality and time to maturity—are the principal determinants of a bond's coupon rate. If the issuer has a poor credit rating, the risk of default is greater, and these bonds pay more interest. Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed to interest rate and inflation risks for an extended period.\nHow Are Bond's Rated?\nCredit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies like Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings. The very highest quality bonds are called “investment grade” and include debt issued by the U.S. government and very stable companies, such as many utilities.1213 Bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called “high yield” or “junk” bonds. These bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk.14\nWhat Is Duration?\nBonds and bond portfolios will rise or fall in value as interest rates change. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called “duration.” The use of the term duration in this context can be confusing to new bond investors because it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. Instead, duration describes how much a bond’s price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates.\nThe Bottom Line \nBonds are issued by companies and governments to finance projects and fund operations. A bond is considered a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate to debtholders. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers or buy government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website. \nCompete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash\nPut your trading skills to the test with our FREE Stock Simulator.

  "text": "Bond Yield: What It Is, Why It Matters, and How It's Calculated\nWhat Is a Bond Yield? \nA bond yield is the return an investor realizes on a bond. Put simply, a bond yield is the return on the capital invested by an investor. Bond yields are different from bond prices—both of which share an inverse relationship. The yield matches the bond's coupon rate when the bond is issued. Bond yields can be derived in different ways, including the coupon yield and current yield. Additional calculations of a bond's yield include yield to maturity (YTM) among others.\nKey Takeaways\nBond yield is the return an investor realizes on an investment in a bond. \nA bond can be purchased for more than its face value, at a premium, or less than its face value, at a discount.\nThe current yield is the bond's coupon rate divided by its market price.\nPrice and yield are inversely related and as the price of a bond goes up, its yield goes down.\nInvestopedia / Daniel Fishel\nUnderstanding Bond Yields \nBonds are essentially a loan to bond issuers. They are considered safe investments. That's because bond values don't change the same way stock prices do. They offer investors a reliable stream of income and provide bondholders with a fixed form of income. \nInvestors earn interest on a bond throughout the life of the asset and receive the face value of the bond upon maturity. Investors can purchase bonds for more than their face value at a premium or less than the face value at a discount. Whichever they buy will change the yield they earn on the bond. \nBonds are rated by services approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and ratings range from \"AAA\" as investment grade with the lowest risk to \"D,\" which are bonds in default, or junk bonds, with the highest risk.1 \nThe return realized by a bond investor is called the yield. There are a couple of different yield-related concepts. These include the: \nCoupon Yield: This is the annual interest rate established when the bond is issued. This figure remains the same for the lifetime of the bond.\nCurrent Yield: This figure depends on the bond's price and its coupon (or its interest payment). So if the price of the bond changes, the bond's yield also changes.\nFormula and Calculation of a Bond Yield \nThe simplest way to calculate a bond yield is to divide its coupon payment by the face value of the bond. This is called the coupon rate.2\nCoupon Rate=Annual Coupon PaymentBond’s Current Market Price\\begin{aligned}&\\text{Coupon Rate}=\\frac{\\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\\text{Bond's Current Market Price}}\\end{aligned}\nIf a bond has a face value of $1,000 and made interest or coupon payments of $100 per year, then its coupon rate is 10% or $100 ÷ $1,000.Bonds are essentially a loan to bond issuers. They are considered safe investments. That's because bond values don't change the same way stock prices do. They offer investors a reliable stream of income and provide bondholders with a fixed form of income.\nBond Yield vs. Bond Price \nPrice and yield are inversely related. This means that as the price of a bond goes up, its yield goes down. Conversely, as the yield goes up, the price of the bond goes down.\nIf an investor purchases a bond with a face value of $1000 that matures in five years with a 10% annual coupon rate, the bond pays 10%, or $100, in interest annually. If interest rates rise above 10%, the bond's price will fall if the investor decides to sell it.3\nIf the interest rate for similar investments rises to 12%, the original bond will still earn a coupon payment of $100, which would be unattractive to investors who can buy bonds that pay $120 as interest rates have risen. To sell the original $1000 bond, the price can be lowered so that the coupon payments and maturity value equal a yield of 12%.\nIf interest rates fall, the bond's price would rise because its coupon payment is more attractive. The further rates fall, the higher the bond's price will rise. In either scenario, the coupon rate no longer has any meaning for a new investor. But if the annual coupon payment is divided by the bond's price, the investor can calculate the current yield and get an estimate of the bond's true yield.\nCurrent Yield=Annual Coupon PaymentBond Price\\text{Current Yield}=\\frac{\\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\\text{Bond Price}}\nThe current yield and the coupon rate are incomplete calculations for a bond's yield because they do not account for the time value of money, maturity value, or payment frequency, and more complex calculations are required. \nAdditional Bond Yield Calculations \nAs noted above, there are additional calculations of a bond's yield. These include the YTM, bond equivalent yield (BEY), and effective annual yield (EAY). \nYield to Maturity (YTM) \nA bond's yield to maturity is equal to the interest rate which makes the present value of all a bond's future cash flows equal to its current price. These cash flows include all the coupon payments and maturity value. Solving for YTM is a trial and error process that can be done on a financial calculator, but the formula is as follows:\nPrice=∑t−1TCash Flowst(1+YTM)twhere:YTM= Yield to maturity\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Price}=\\sum^T_{t-1}\\frac{\\text{Cash Flows}_t}{(1+\\text{YTM})^t}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{YTM}=\\text{ Yield to maturity} \\end{aligned}\nIn the previous example, a bond with a $1,000 face value, five years to maturity, and $100 annual coupon payments is worth $927.90 to match a new YTM of 12%. The five coupon payments plus the $1,000 maturity value are the bond's six cash flows.\nFinding the present value of each of those six cash flows with an interest rate of 12% will determine what the bond's current price should be. \nBond Equivalent Yield (BEY) \nBond yields are quoted as a bond equivalent yield, which adjusts for the bond coupon paid in two semi-annual payments. In the previous example, the bonds' cash flows were annual, so the YTM is equal to the BEY. \nHowever, if the coupon payments were made every six months, the semi-annual YTM would be 5.979%. The BEY is a simple annualized version of the semi-annual YTM and is calculated by multiplying the YTM by two. \nIn this example, the BEY of a bond that pays semi-annual coupon payments of $50 would be 11.958% (5.979% X 2 = 11.958%). The BEY does not account for the time value of money for the adjustment from a semi-annual YTM to an annual rate. \nEffective Annual Yield (EAY) \nInvestors can define a more precise annual yield given the BEY for a bond when considering the time value of money in the calculation. In the case of a semi-annual coupon payment, the effective annual yield would be calculated as follows:\nEAY=(1+in)n−1where:i=Nominal interest rate (as a decimal)n=Number of compounding periods per year\\begin{aligned}&EAY=\\left(1+\\frac{i}{n}\\right)^n-1\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&i=\\text{Nominal interest rate (as a decimal)}\\\\&n=\\text{Number of compounding periods per year}\\end{aligned}\nIf an investor knows that the semi-annual YTM was 5.979%, they could use the previous formula to find the EAY of 12.32%. Because the extra compounding period is included, the EAY will be higher than the BEY.\nA bond rating is a grade given to a bond and indicates its credit quality. The rating takes into consideration a bond issuer's financial strength or its ability to pay a bond's principal and interest in a timely fashion. There are three bond rating agencies in the United States that account for approximately 95% of all bond ratings and include Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings, and Moody’s Investors Service.4\nBond Yield Calculation Issues \nSome factors skew the calculations in determining a bond's yield. In the previous examples, it was assumed that the bond had exactly five years left to maturity when it was sold, which is rare. The fractional periods can be defined but the accrued interest is more difficult to calculate. \nAssume a bond has four years and eight months to maturity. The exponent in the yield calculations can be turned into a decimal to adjust for the partial year. \nHowever, this means that four months in the current coupon period have elapsed with two remaining, which requires an adjustment for accrued interest. A new bond buyer will be paid the full coupon, so the bond's price will be inflated slightly to compensate the seller for the four months in the current coupon period that have elapsed. \nBonds can be quoted with a clean price that excludes the accrued interest or a dirty price that includes the amount owed to reconcile the accrued interest. When bonds are quoted in a system like a Bloomberg or Reuters terminal, the clean price is used. \nWhat Does a Bond's Yield Tell Investors?\nA bond's yield is the return to an investor from the bond's interest, or coupon, payments. It can be calculated as a simple coupon yield or using a more complex method like yield to maturity. Higher yields mean that bond investors are owed larger interest payments, but may also be a sign of greater risk. The riskier a borrower is, the more yield investors demand. Higher yields are often common with a longer maturity bond.\nAre High-Yield Bonds Better Investments Than Low-Yield Bonds?\nBond investment depends on an investor's circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. Low-yield bonds may be better for investors who want a virtually risk-free asset, or one who is hedging a mixed portfolio by keeping a portion of it in a low-risk asset. High-yield bonds may be better suited for investors who are willing to accept a degree of risk in return for a higher return.\nHow Do Investors Utilize Bond Yields?\nYields are used for more sophisticated analyses. Bonds of different maturities can be traded to take advantage of the yield curve, which plots the interest rates of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates.\nThe slope of the yield curve gives an idea of future interest rate changes and economic activity. They may also look at the difference in interest rates between different categories of bonds, holding some characteristics constant.\nA yield spread is a difference between yields on differing debt instruments of varying maturities, credit ratings, issuer, or risk level, calculated by deducting the yield of one instrument from the other such as the spread between AAA corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries. This difference is most often expressed in basis points (bps) or percentage points.\nThe Bottom Line \nBond yield is the amount of return an investor will realize on a bond. The coupon rate and current yield are basic yield concepts and calculations. A bond rating is a grade given to a bond and indicates its credit quality and often the level of risk to the investor in purchasing the bond.",

  "text": "Technical Analysis: What It Is and How to Use It in Investing\nWhat Is Technical Analysis? \nTechnical analysis is a method of evaluating statistical trends in trading activity, typically involving price movement and volume. It is used to identify trading and investment opportunities. \nUnlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a security's value based on financial information such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on price and volume to draw conclusions about future price movements. \nKey Takeaways\nTechnical analysis is used to evaluate price trends and patterns and thereby identify potential investments and trading opportunities.\nTechnical analysts believe past trading activity and a security's price changes can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements.\nTechnical analysis may be contrasted with fundamental analysis, which focuses on a company's financials rather than historical price patterns or stock trends.\nTechnical analysis was introduced by Charles Dow.\nInvestopedia / Candra Huff\nUnderstanding Technical Analysis \nTechnical analysis is used to scrutinize the ways supply and demand for a security affect changes in price, volume, and implied volatility. It assumes that past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements when paired with appropriate investing or trading rules. \nTechnical analysis' various charting tools are often used to generate short-term trading signals. They can also help improve the evaluation of a security's strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its sectors. This information helps analysts improve their overall valuation estimate. \nTechnical analysis as we know it today was first introduced by Charles Dow as the Dow Theory in the late 1800s.1 Several noteworthy researchers including William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson Gould, and John Magee further contributed to Dow Theory concepts. Nowadays, technical analysis has evolved to include hundreds of patterns and signals developed through years of research. \nHow Technical Analysis Is Used \nProfessional analysts often use technical analysis in conjunction with other forms of research. Retail traders may make decisions based solely on the price charts of a security and similar statistics. But practicing equity analysts rarely limit their research to fundamental or technical analysis alone.\nTechnical analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data. This includes stocks, futures, commodities, fixed-income securities, currencies, and more. In fact, technical analysis is prevalent in commodities and forex markets where traders focus on short-term price movements.\nTechnical analysis attempts to forecast the price movement of virtually any tradable instrument that is generally subject to forces of supply and demand. Some view technical analysis as simply the supply and demand forces reflected by the market price movements of a security. \nTechnical analysis most commonly applies to price changes, but some analysts track numbers other than just price, such as trading volume or open interest figures. \nTechnical Analysis Indicators \nHundreds of patterns and signals have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading. Technical analysts have also developed numerous types of trading systems to help them forecast and trade on price movements. \nSome indicators focus primarily on identifying the current market trend, including support and resistance areas. Others focus on determining the strength of a trend and the likelihood of its continuation. \nCommonly used technical indicators and charting patterns include trendlines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators. \nIn general, technical analysts look at the following broad types of indicators: \nPrice trends\nChart patterns\nVolume and momentum indicators\nOscillators\nMoving averages\nSupport and resistance levels\nThe CMT Association supports the largest collection of chartered or certified analysts using technical analysis professionally around the world. The association's Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation can be obtained after three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical analysis tools.2\nUnderlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis \nTechnical analysis attempts to decipher the market sentiment behind price trends by looking for price patterns and trends. \nCharles Dow released a series of editorials discussing technical analysis theory. He had two basic assumptions that continue to form the framework for technical analysis trading. \nMarkets are efficient with values that represent factors that influence a security's price.\nEven random market price movements appear to move in identifiable patterns and trends that tend to repeat over time.3\nToday the field of technical analysis builds on Dow's work. Professional analysts typically accept three general assumptions: \nThe market discounts everything: Technical analysts believe that everything from a company's fundamentals to broad market factors to market psychology is already priced into a stock. The Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) draws a similar conclusion about prices. The only thing remaining is the analysis of price movements, which technical analysts view as the product of supply and demand for a particular stock.\nPrice moves in trends: Technical analysts expect that prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. In other words, a stock price is more likely to continue a past trend than to move erratically. Most technical trading strategies are based on this assumption.\nHistory tends to repeat itself: The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable and based on emotions such as fear and excitement. Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze these emotions and subsequent price movements to understand trends. While many forms of technical analysis have been used for more than 100 years, they are believed to be relevant still because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.\nFundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis \nFundamental analysis and technical analysis, the major schools of thought when it comes to approaching the markets, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Both methods are used to research and forecast future trends in stock prices, and like any investment strategy or philosophy, both have their advocates and adversaries. \nFundamental Analysis \nFundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies. Earnings, expenses, assets, and liabilities are all important characteristics of fundamental analysis that help analysts determine the fair value of a business. \nTechnical Analysis \nTechnical analysis differs from fundamental analysis in that the stock's price and volume are the only inputs. The core assumption is that all publicly known fundamentals have factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that suggest how a stock's price will move in the future. \nLimitations of Technical Analysis \n1. For some analysts and academic researchers, the EMH demonstrates why no actionable information is contained in historical price and volume data. However, by the same reasoning, nor should business fundamentals provide actionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and semi-strong form of the EMH. \n2. Another criticism of technical analysis is that history does not repeat itself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be ignored. Prices seem to be better modeled as a random walk. \n3. A third criticism of technical analysis is that it works in some cases but only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, many technical traders will place a stop-loss order below the 200-day moving average of a certain company. \nIf a large number of traders have done so and the stock reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock price down, confirming the movement traders anticipated. \nThen, other traders will see the price decrease and sell their positions, reinforcing the strength of the trend. This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the asset's price will be weeks or months from now. \nIn sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal. However, over the long run, this sole group of traders cannot drive the price. \nWhat Assumptions Do Technical Analysts Make?\nProfessional technical analysts typically assume three things. First, the market discounts everything. Second, prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. Third, history tends to repeat itself. The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable. \nWhat's the Difference Between Fundamental and Technical Analysis?\nFundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. The core assumption of technical analysis, on the other hand, is that all known fundamentals are factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that might suggest how the security's price will move in the future.\nHow Can I Learn Technical Analysis?\nYour first step is to learn about investing, stocks, markets, and financials. This can be done through books, online courses and materials, and in-person classes. Once you understand the basics, you can start studying technical analysis.\nThe Bottom Line \nTechnical analysis is a longstanding method of analyzing the price and volume data of securities to determine future price action. This data usually appears on charts. Investors and professional traders apply a variety of technical indicators to these price and volume charts to draw conclusions and make decisions about entry and exit points for trades. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "The 7 Best Investing Books\nIf you’re like many astute people, you are always on the lookout for solid books on investing. You may want to start with a book that lays out the entire landscape of investing opportunities, from stocks and bonds to real estate, fine art, and cryptocurrencies. You may want to zero in on an area of investing or to understand the thinking behind how experts approach investing and money. \nBelow, we have covered all areas, starting with our best overall book on investing: \"The Bond King,\" by NPR “Planet Money” podcaster and journalist Mary Childs, who delivers a powerful biography of Bill Gross, formerly of PIMCO, who made a whole new market on trading bonds and ended up revered by some, but not by others, while becoming extremely wealthy. For value investing, we recommend Benjamin Graham’s \"The Intelligent Investor,\" a favorite of many of the world’s most successful investors. For a solid book on investing overall, we cite \"The Only Investment Guide You’ll Ever Need\" by Andrew Tobias. \nBest Overall: \"The Bond King\" \nThis may be the year for books about Bill Gross. In addition to The Bond King by Mary Childs, which we rank the best overall investing book on our list, the subject himself has released a self-published autobiography titled I’m Still Standing: Bond King Bill Gross and the PIMCO Express. \nChilds’ authoritative, engaging book about pioneering bond trader Gross, from the investment management firm PIMCO, portrays him as brilliant and a visionary, who devised a new way to invest by making a market for trading bonds. Yet he also comes across as an egotistical, mercurial boss who was so verbally abusive to his staff that some avoided walking by his office to keep from running into him. After many years, enough staff members quit—including PIMCO’s former co-CEO and co-CIO, economist Mohamed El-Erian, whom Gross had recruited from Harvard Management Co. as his eventual successor—that Gross was forced to resign from the company he built. \nChilds, a co-host of NPR’s “Planet Money” podcast who has also reported for Barron’s, the Financial Times and Bloomberg News, takes the reader through the subprime mortgage crisis, in which many Americans lost their homes due to predatory lending practices. At the time, Gross’ number was on the speed dial, so to speak, of many top federal and banking officials who valued his opinion and sway. \nEarly on, Gross learned about strategy by successfully counting cards as a blackjack player at various Las Vegas casinos. He took that same push-to-the-limit mentality to the bond market, where he was dubbed the “Bond King” by Fortune in 2002. During those years, he was a darling of the financial press—beaming from business magazine covers, being interviewed on CNBC, and being a sought-after speaker at financial gatherings. \nAfter he was ousted from PIMCO, he went to Janus Capital Group, where he was unable to duplicate his earlier success. In 2019, Gross revealed that he had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which affects communication skills. In 2022, far from having “lost it all,” Forbes put Gross’ net worth at $2.6 billion.1 \nBest Book About Value Investing: \"The Intelligent Investor\" \nThe key lesson from Benjamin Graham’s much-lauded tome: “Don’t lose.” Easier said than done, of course. So read on. The reason why this book, originally published in 1949, is still in print is that it offers investors—be they beginners, those with some knowledge and success, or old hands—the nuts and bolts of value investing, which is buying stocks of quality companies whose worth is undervalued. The practice is akin to buying a finely made piece of furniture at a discount. It was most recently updated in 2006. \nGraham largely shuns the practice of analyzing securities in favor of expanding on investment principles and investors’ attitudes. He notes that the intelligence of any investor has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. “It simply means being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to harness your emotions and think for yourself,” he writes. \nChapters cover investment vs. speculation, the investor and inflation, general portfolio strategy, stock selection for both the enterprising and defensive investors, comparisons of companies, and many other subjects. To bolster the book’s relevance, Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig added commentary after each chapter with recent examples. In the preface to the fourth edition, Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, wrote: “I read the first edition of this book in early 1950, when I was 19. I thought then that it was by far the best book on investing. I still think it is.” \nBest Book on Investments Helping Society: \"Patient Capital\" \n“Many of society’s most intractable problems—from addressing the environment, to revitalizing decaying infrastructure in developed and developing nations alike to national security, to the hunger for innovation to stimulate economic growth—resist easy solutions. Rather, they can only be addressed with the thoughtful application of time and money,” write Victoria Ivashina and Josh Lerner, both Harvard Business School professors. \nThe authors cite the Rockefeller family’s wealth as an example of the use of patient capital. The patriarch, John D. Rockefeller, turned a $4,000 investment in the oil refinery Standard Oil into the initial source of the family’s vast holdings. Two generations later—led by his grandchildren, especially Laurance—long-term capital brought about the development of Eastern Air Lines, a carve-out from General Motors; military contractor McDonnell Aircraft Corp., which eventually was folded into Boeing Co.; the unfolding of tourism and conservation in the U.S. Virgin Islands, including building the exclusive and environmentally friendly Caneel Bay resort on St. John Island; and providing critical funding for the expansion of national parks in the United States. \n“Rather than having a set life, RBI [Rockefeller Brothers, Inc., which included Laurance, four brothers, and sister, Babs] was organized as an evergreen fund. Laurance anticipated that the investments would be held for a decade and then sold or taken public,” write Ivashina and Lerner. “Rather than being returned to investors (as in today’s standard fund), the proceeds of the successful would flow back into the fund, ready to be used for subsequent investments.” \nThe authors explain that the use of patient capital, or long-term capital, means that the investor, like the Rockefeller family, is willing to wait as long as decades for a return. Governments aren’t able to underwrite many of these projects, due to the lack of political will to fund such long-term plans. However, pools of capital in pensions, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and family holdings matched with the right entities can do the job. These arranged marriages, the authors maintain, can yield “benefits for investors, fund managers, and society as a whole.” \nBest Book About Investing Gone Awry: \"The Billionaire’s Apprentice\" \nThis book about how investing went south reads like a thriller, and covers: \nThe South Asian diaspora and its community’s quick rise in the United States in influential areas of business and professions\nThe influx of South Asians to the United States post-1965, when U.S. immigration laws were relaxed\nAn Othello-Iago story, which is the pairing in crime of a high-born Indian immigrant who headed the consulting company McKinsey and Co., named Rajat Gupta (Othello), with math genius Sri Lankan immigrant Raj Rajaratnam (Iago), who led the Galleon Hedge Fund and became a billionaire\nTheir downfall, which led to prison terms for both over convictions related to insider trading\nAuthor Anita Raghavan characterizes Rajaratnam as the “king of wealth” and Gupta as the “king of thought.” Of the title, it was Gupta, a decade older than Rajaratnam, who was lured by the chance to become a billionaire after spending three decades at the consulting firm where he drew a salary in the millions. At the time of their arrests—prosecuted by Indian-born Preet Bharara, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York—some reporters lamented the men’s downfall, saying it reflected poorly on the ascendant South Asian community. \nRaghavan—herself of South Asian descent and a contributor to The New York Times, who also had held positions at The Wall Street Journal and Forbes—noted that the Gupta-Rajaratnam affair is a part of the South Asian story but not its defining moment. In The Billionaire’s Apprentice, she closes with a surprising Gupta family secret that foreshadows Rajat Gupta’s crimes. \nBest Book on Day Trading: \"The Ultimate Day Trader\" \nAfter explaining to readers that The Ultimate Day Trader is for the experienced investor, Jacob Bernstein welcomes beginners in the first chapter, “Definitions and Directions—What It Means to Day Trade Today,” for those who are considering joining the market or simply want to know more about the subject. “A day trader,” he writes, “is an individual who enters and exits a position in the markets during the course of the trading day.” Of course, the “trading day” is now 24 hours, due to the advent of 24-hour trading in many markets. \nBernstein suggests there are 11 reasons to day trade, including reduced headline risk, knowing the results by the end of the “day,” the availability of reliable forecasting, the chance for instant execution, market volatility, and the sheer pleasure of doing it. The downsides, which may not be drawbacks to all, are that day trading is very hard work, subject to random events that impact prices, time consuming, competitive, and stressful. \nThe author is the founder of the money management firm Bernstein Investments Inc. and has written 35 books on trading, investor, investor psychology, and economic forecasts, including The Compleat Day Trader. Bernstein employs his straightforward, understandable writing style and punctuates it with charts and graphs to lead the reader through day trading markets and methods, gap day trading, volume spikes and their use in day trading, the importance of structure, exit strategies, and the “10 Cardinal Rules of Day Trading.” \nAmong his rules are doing your homework, showing consistency, avoiding any stocks or futures markets that “scare you,” and being willing and able to make big moves, which is the way to make profits. At the end, Bernstein asks whether you have what it takes to be a day trader. That is, can you own up to your losses and move on? If so, get started. \nBest on the Thinking Behind Money and Investing: \"The Psychology of Money\" \nThis breezy book takes the reader on a journey across 19 short chapters, which spell out the sometimes odd ways that people think about money and the behavioral psychology surrounding it, then suggest ways to become more financially secure. One example: Author Morgan Housel recommends staying wealthy, as opposed to getting wealthy. To illustrate the point, he draws on the life and work of Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, who began investing as a child and simply loves to make money, while he famously shuns the modern trappings of wealth. \nHousel maintains that the goal of having money is the freedom it affords people to make choices that make them happy. “It is the highest dividend money pays,” writes Housel, a former Wall Street Journal columnist, who has won many journalism awards. One place where we disagree with Housel: He considers Benjamin Graham’s above-mentioned The Intelligent Investor dated and not useful for today’s investors. However, the rest of his advice is excellent. \n“[Housel’s book] covers some of the most important topics in finance, which are unexpected and fun to contemplate. Why were Warren Buffett and Bill Gates so successful? Sure, they’re smart people, but there are a lot of smart people out there. Buffett used time to his advantage and Gates was fortunate enough to attend a school where there was access to a computer [at a time when few schools had them],” writes Certified Financial Planner Justin Pritchard. \nBest Investing How-To Book: \"The Only Investment Guide You’ll Ever Need\" \n“Lives up to its brash title” is how the Los Angeles Times described Andrew Tobias’s investment book, which debuted in 1978 and has been revised several times, including in 2022. \nIn the latest revision, this best-selling author covers the economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic and how investors and taxpayers fared during the Trump administration and others prior. With knowledge and wit, Tobias takes readers through the basics of investment vehicles—stocks, bonds (savings, municipal, corporate, convertible, zero-coupon), mutual funds, U.S. Treasury bills, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the various retirement accounts. He also delves into tax strategies and discusses finding and dealing with brokers. Tobias suggests a stock market strategy of putting the bulk of your savings in mutual funds and ETFs, and no more than 20% into funds you direct. \nThroughout, he assumes the role of the wise, well-off uncle, especially in the chapter “A Penny Saved is Two Pennies Earned,” in which he dispenses commonsense money advice on everything from credit cards to saving on vacations, monitoring your bank accounts, and buying cubic zirconium jewelry instead of diamonds (“ridiculous,” he writes). In the appendices, Tobias tackles Social Security, life insurance, saving money by buying wine by the case, the national debt, and selected discount brokers. About the book, Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban wrote: “This is the only investment book I’ve read that truly made sense.” \nThe Bottom Line\n\"The Bond King,\" by NPR “Planet Money” podcaster and journalist Mary Childs, is our best book overall. The tale of how Bill Gross, formerly of PIMCO, made a whole new market on trading bonds reveals how Wall Street works and how you can be fired from the company you built up and still end up with $2.6 billion.\nWhy Trust Investopedia? \nMichelle Lodge is steeped in the book and book-reviewing world. She has been published in Publishers Weekly and was an editor and writer for Library Journal, both of which cover books and the industry. While a book review editor at Library Journal, which recommends books for public library collections, she selected a number of fine business books for review. She was also the editor of the On Wall Street Book Club, in which she reviewed books and interviewed authors on a podcast. \nTo find the best investing books, Lodge considered recommendations from Investopedia Financial Review Board members and Investopedia editors, business executives, bestseller lists from the Financial Times, The New York Times, The Times of London, and others, as well as her own experience as a book review editor.",

  "text": "What Is the Best Way to Invest $100K in Cash?\nThere's not one best way to invest $100,000 in cash. You have many options depending on your goals and needs. You can choose the investment vehicle or a combination of vehicles that's right for you after determining that investing is something you should do with your money right now. \nFinding an extra $100,000 in discretionary cash on hand is a problem that most people would be happy to have. The key word here is discretionary. Your $100,000 in extra cash really is extra and you don't have any outstanding debt, especially high-interest credit card debt. Most finance professionals would otherwise say that your priority for that chunk of change should be to pay down your debts. \nYou're already ahead of the game when that's been accomplished and if you already have some other assets in place such as a viable retirement plan, an adequate emergency fund, and some other well-placed capital. \nKey Takeaways\nTake care of the basics first if you find yourself with discretionary cash: pay off debt, set up or continue funding a retirement plan, and set aside an emergency fund.\nExplore tax-free rollovers into other qualified accounts if the source of your money is from a retirement account such as an IRA.\nInvestments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and CDs are a good way to use cash.\nReal estate can be a rewarding option with the potential for generous profits.\nCDs and high-yielding savings accounts are viable options for the risk-averse.\nReal Estate \nIt may not be the most exciting prospect but consider paying off your mortgage if you have one. Consider investing in real estate if you don't already own your home or purchase an investment property. Real estate can be a solid investment but it has risks and requires that you do your due diligence. \nTraditional Real Estate Investing \nMost people think of purchasing and flipping properties or purchasing and renting out for income when they consider investing in real estate. Several factors contribute to whether gains would be realized quickly, over a long period, or even at all. \nFirst: location, location, location! A property's location is one of the most important determinants of its value. Choosing the right location is just as important as choosing the right property to get the biggest bang for your buck. \nThe condition of the market is perhaps the best indicator of whether traditional real estate investing is a good idea. It might be a good time to sit back and wait for prices to settle if they're volatile. \nReal estate purchases command a significant outlay of capital. An investor should consider their return on investment (ROI), the property's profitability, and the associated costs before investing in it. Consider how much of your $100,000 will be used toward the purchase, repairs, renovations, and marketing of the property. \nSelling costs should be factored in for flips. Maintenance costs must be considered for rentals.\nReal estate is one of the few assets that tends to appreciate over time. Some investors hold their properties until such appreciation is large enough to generate the desired profit. \nReal Estate Investment Trust (REIT) \nA real estate investment trust (REIT) could be a great option if you want to invest in real estate without the complexities associated with directly purchasing property. Investing is simple and doesn't necessarily require a lot of money. Some investment platforms allow investments as low as $100. \nREITs have properties in their portfolios that generate income, unlike traditional real estate investments that are flipped and resold. They include retail spaces, medical facilities, residential properties, and commercial properties such as office buildings. \nYou can purchase REIT shares through a broker or directly from a REIT company. REITs pay their shareholders dividends that are taxed as regular income but gains are taxed as capital gains.12\nTaxable Investments \nYour earnings or capital gains will be considered taxable income if you put your extra cash into taxable investments. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are among the most common. Some of these instruments such as dividend-paying stocks could generate periodic income. \nLow-Risk Investments \nYou can invest in high-yielding certificates of deposit (CDs) or a high-interest savings account if you're squeamish about investing in the market and want your money to be safe. Your principal is even insured by the federal government if the bank is an FDIC member and almost all banks are.3 \nCDs are paying better interest rates due to inflation. Rates above 4% can be found for short-term CDs as of late 2024. Compare offers for the best rates.4\nDon't just drop by your local bank branch. Shop around for the best bank rates. Those for high-yield savings accounts may be offered by the online platforms of various financial services firms whose names you might already know such as Goldman Sachs, American Express, and Barclays Bank. You can also find out-of-state banks with competitive offers online. \nRetirement Accounts \nYou could look into opening a Roth IRA account if your retirement plan is an individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k). Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are tax-deductible but not tax-free. You pay the income tax due in the year you deposit the money to a Roth account but you'll owe no further tax on the principal or investment gains when you withdraw the money.5 \nConverting to a Roth IRA from a traditional account is a taxable event. The amount of the conversion is reported as ordinary taxable income.6\nNot only can Roth earnings grow tax-free but these accounts aren't subject to the IRS minimum distribution rules. They allow funds to accumulate past retirement.7 There's no maximum age limit to participate unlike with traditional IRAs. \nInvesting the entire $100,000 wouldn't be possible, however, unless you're rolling over from an eligible retirement account. The IRS limits how much you can contribute to a Roth annually. The maximum contribution is $7,000 or $8.000 for individuals age 50 or older in 2024.8 \nA taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI) can't exceed the limit for Roth eligibility. Married couples filing jointly can't contribute if their incomes are $240,000 or more in 2024.9 \nDiversify, Diversify, Diversify \nYour $100,000 is a respectable sum that allows you to apply the investing 101 mantra of diversification. Consider dividing up the $100,000. Put a portion of it into vehicles that you already own like your IRA and try some new investment tools with the balance. \nDeciding how to allocate this kind of extra capital involves weighing your options carefully, considering your short- and long-term financial goals, and being realistic about your risk tolerance. It's always a good idea to seek the advice of a financial professional before investing. \nAdditional Tips \nYou have plenty of options for investing your $100,000 including building and managing a portfolio of investments. You might be able to go at it alone, picking your stocks, bonds, and other securities if you're a savvy investor. Enlisting the services of a licensed financial advisor makes sense if you're a novice. These professionals create investment solutions that help you achieve your financial goals. They can also manage how and where to invest your money in addition to making recommendations. \nUnderstanding how your money will be taxed is crucial for protecting it and determining where you should put it because investments can produce different tax situations. You'll want to consider tax-efficient investments if your $100,000 came to you tax-free. Consider rollover or transfer options that defer taxation and offer features that match your financial goals if the source of your $100,000 is a qualified retirement account.\nHow Can I Invest $100k to Make Passive Income?\nYou could invest your $100,000 in real estate, real estate investment trusts (REITs), stocks, or other securities. Thoroughly research your options and speak with a professional such as a broker or investment advisor to help you choose the investment that will generate the income you desire.\nHow Can I Invest $100k to Make $1 Million?\nIt's possible to make $1 million from a $100,000 investment but this likely requires long-term investing. Some investments can generate monstrous returns quickly but they're extremely risky. Financial advisors can help you choose what best suits your needs and aligns with your goals.\nWhat Real Estate Options Are a Good Place to Invest $100k?\nReal estate flipping is one common real estate investment option. It involves purchasing, renovating, and later selling a property for profit. Real estate investors can also rent out their properties to generate monthly income while the property's value appreciates. Purchasing real estate requires a large amount of cash, however.\nAnother option is to invest in a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in income-producing real estate and requires less capital.\nThe Bottom Line \nYou have $100,000 and want to know where to invest it. The recommended first step is to research your options to make an informed decision. Exercise due diligence so your funds land where you want. Plenty of options are available from real estate to managed portfolios. The journey to find the right investment can be rewarding.\nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading. The USD Interest account on Uphold allows you to maximize your USD by earning 4.90% APY* on amounts over $1,000 and 2% on smaller balances. Start earning interest in as little as one business day.

  "text": "How to Invest in AI in 2024\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept—it's a transformative force reshaping industries and everyday life. Before investing in AI, it’s useful to understand what artificial intelligence is; AI technology infuses computers and tech products with human-like intelligence and problem-solving abilities. From virtual assistants in our homes to autonomous vehicles on our roads, AI is quickly being added to many products and applications, dominating discussions of investments and questions about the future. \nThe AI landscape is complex and news of added capabilities at one firm reshuffles the pace of change at all of them. Choosing the best AI companies to invest in is a tricky endeavor—even if you're using the best online brokers and trading platforms. Just as investors half a generation ago had to separate the wheat from the chaff among web browser, smartphone, and app-based startups, so too are niche players and established tech giants now vying for AI market share and research capital. \nIn this article, we explore how to invest in AI and showcase the best AI stocks and funds. \nKey Takeaways\nInvesting in AI technology is not monolithic, with investment opportunities across diverse sectors and international AI companies. From startups to established firms, AI is a central feature in a range of companies. Investment opportunities in AI offer great potential, and great risk should companies with promise falter. \nLaws and regulations, including those involving copyright, could evolve and vary across geographies, affecting investments.\nAs much as with any other theme, investing in this area requires ongoing education and engagement to understand the potential and limitations of AI-based products.\nHow to Invest in AI \nLike past emerging technologies, such as railroads in the late 1800s or the personal computer in the 1980s, there are many ways to invest in AI. While some companies will have wild success, other early companies will fail. \nThe computer revolution is an apt analogy for AI investing and how to invest in AI. Computers set the stage for automating mundane and repeatable tasks, and now AI seeks to advance this concept by automating tasks that previously required human intelligence. \nInvestors can find some top AI stocks have one-year returns in the high double digits, with NVIDIA reporting 176% 12-month growth as of July 23, 2024.1 \nSome people want to invest directly in companies that develop AI, while others might invest in those companies that stand to benefit the most from its wider adoption. Using the introduction and growth of the personal computer industry as an example, some investors successfully invested in computer manufacturers or hardware companies that made routers and switches. Others invested in software companies that produced computer programs, while others attempted to identify companies that would benefit most from the automation that computers offered. \nSome of these investments were direct bets on computers and the actual technology, while others were more conservative, such as buying shares in already strong companies that stood to benefit from the growth of computer usage. The point is that there are various ways to invest in a new technology. \nSometimes, one firm takes and holds a market-leading position, but other times, an imitator can use the first company's technology better, making it more successful over time. Since it’s tough to pick the winning AI stocks in advance, owning several or selecting an AI ETF could minimize making a wrong move. \nInvest in AI Stocks and ETFs \nLeading Companies in AI \nWhile these are among the top AI stocks, consider the business cycle and valuations before going all in. You might want to incorporate a dollar cost average into your AI stock picks as a hedge against a market drop. \nNVIDIA (NVDA): NVIDIA Corp. is at the forefront of the AI revolution thanks to its work in designing and developing graphics processing units (GPUs) and related software and data center networking solutions. Investors have noticed: As of July 23, 2024, its share price has risen 176% during the past 12 months and grown by more than 2,885% in the past five.2 These GPUs, originally created for the PC graphics and video gaming industries, have become the backbone of AI, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, robotics, augmented reality and virtual reality applications, and even cryptocurrency mining systems.\nMicrosoft (MSFT): Microsoft is an example of a legacy tech company delivering AI investing promises. Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. It has leveraged that partnership to embed AI in its Azure cloud services, and Microsoft 365 now has an add-on subscription for generative AI, called Copilot. Microsoft said in its April 2024 earnings call that 65% of the Fortune 500 was using its Azure OpenAI service, about the same percentage that it said was using Copilot.3\nAeroVironment Inc. (AVAV): Government contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. allies provide a degree of support for this narrowly focused AI stock. AeroVironment Inc. supplies unstaffed aircraft and tactical mission systems along with high-altitude pseudo-satellites. The AVAV systems provide security and surveillance without the necessity of a person or driver in the air. \nAmazon.com (AMZN): Amazon’s generative AI capabilities improve customer experience, improve employee productivity, broaden creativity and content creation, and maximize processes. Amazon uses AI in its Alexa system and also sells machine learning and AI services to business customers. Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, provides an AI infrastructure that allows its customers to analyze data and incorporate AI into their existing systems. Amazon has also made its Amazon Q AI assistant generally available for software development and data analysis. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest chipmaker and a global player in chip manufacturing for artificial intelligence. As AI grows, the need for robust computing chips will grow with it. TSM is a mature company that continues to make chips for non-AI computer applications, so it may represent less risk than other pure plays on AI. \nArista Networks Inc. (ANET): Launched in 2008, Arista bridges the gap between startup and legacy tech companies.4 Arista is a networking equipment company that sells ethernet switches and software to data centers. With the ethernet among the best options to power AI workloads, Arista is well-positioned to capitalize on its power to improve how we work, recreate, and learn.5 \nAdobe Inc. (ADBE): Global workers have depended upon Adobe products for content creation, document management, digital marketing, advertising software, and services for years. Among the older companies on our list of best AI companies to invest in, Adobe has infused most of its products and services with AI features, boosting its already impressive competitive advantage.6 Recent performance has lagged behind our other best AI firms, but the company could be a bargain now.7 According to Morningstar, the company is significantly undervalued and holds a four-star ranking.8 \nCompare Some Top Brokers to Invest in AI Stocks \nBest AI ETFs \nInvesting in professionally managed ETFs or mutual funds that hold shares in AI companies allows you to leave it to a fund's professional managers to research and pick suitable AI companies. Through an ETF, you own a share of a portfolio of multiple AI stocks within a single investment. \niShares Exponential Technologies ETF (XT): XT is a large capitalization fund that includes 186 U.S. and global stocks trying to disrupt the industry.9 With $3.4 billion in assets, XT hones in on the power of AI to automate, analyze, and create new ideas. The fund spans the tech, healthcare, industrial, and financial sectors. \nDefiance Machine Learning & Quantum Computing ETF (QTUM): This index AI fund brings artificial intelligence and machine learning to a range of industries. The fund replicates the BlueStar Quantum Computing and Machine Learning Index (BQTUM), which tracks 71 global stocks with multi-market capitalization. The Defiance Machine Learning & Quantum Computing ETF captures returns of the companies at the forefront of next-gen disruptive technology and machine learning.\nROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (ROBO): This ETF invests in companies focused on robotics, automation, and AI, including growth and blend stocks of all market capitalizations. \nCompare Some Top Brokers to Invest in AI ETFs \nHow to Search for AI Investments \nBuying individual AI stocks is more work for the investor. Given the multiple ways to invest in AI, the first step is to read about the industry to understand the various aspects of artificial intelligence. Within the AI universe, there are pure plays and more conservative plays, and you'll have to decide the type of exposure you want in this market sector. Once you have an idea of the parts of the AI market you want to invest in, you can perform traditional investment analyses—both fundamental and technical. \nEarnings forecasts: Earnings are a great way to judge a company's performance, and AI companies with consistent and growing earnings should be looked at favorably. Many AI companies will be viewed as growth stocks, so earnings growth will be an important criterion for many investors. Earnings releases tend to move AI stocks up or down sharply.\nAnnual reports: These reports provide important details about the company's activities and future growth plans. The financial statements allow you to review the company's debt-to-equity and other accounting ratios, which are used to make financial decisions about stocks. \nRelative performance vs. the market: Relative performance is how an individual stock performs compared with an index or another stock. For newer AI companies, it's best to compare their relative performance with similar companies. \nGrowth analysis: This deals with a company's growth over time. You'll examine earnings, market share, and other metrics to determine the company's strength and prospects.\nAnalyst projections: Analyses and reports can be especially worthwhile if you're new to the AI space. This volatile market has constant and new technological developments, and company prospects change much more quickly than in more mature industries. Therefore, it's good to gain the perspective of professional researchers who understand the overall AI space and the prospects of individual stocks relative to competitors.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) \nCan Investors Make Money in AI?\nAI is exploding, and the technology behind it appears poised to break out further and deliver on expectations for more widespread adoption across a wide range of businesses and real-world applications. Like any technology that requires massive capital investment, AI offers plenty of opportunities for investors to make money, but new technologies also involve risk. \nYou'll want to determine the best way to gain exposure without involving risk beyond your tolerance. Choices include more speculative direct AI investments in individual companies or ETFs and mutual funds that offer a portfolio of multiple companies in the AI space. You can also look to invest in companies that are positioned to increase their revenues as AI is more widely adopted across the economy.\nHow Can You Invest in AI Art?\nGenerative AI use for images is among its most popular applications. Users can type or speak of an image they want to create, and an AI program can produce an image that meets that description—most of the time. These AI programs use the user’s description with images available worldwide to generate the image for the user requesting the artwork. \nPeople of all ages and backgrounds have utilized AI-generated artwork. Once you’ve created AI art, you can sell it and/or buy from others on AI art marketplaces. Art made with AI can be collected as giclee prints, digital downloads, NFTs, and other formats. It can be bought and sold on some crypto platforms and designated AI art websites. However, the profit and investment potential for AI art is still in its infancy and cannot be accurately ascertained. \nHow Can You Invest in AI Startups?\nStartup companies are often created in new and promising fields, such as AI and machine learning. Often, these are companies that have been initially capitalized by venture capital investors, then taken public to capitalize on their initial investment and to raise more capital as the business increases its operations and begins offering its products to a wider customer base. \nMany startup investments are only available to large accredited investors. Other websites enable the public to invest small amounts in promising new ventures. You’ll need to sift through the offerings to uncover the AI startup companies. While investing in startups can be risky, the rewards for investing in a successful startup company can be huge. Examples of successful startup companies include Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.\nCan You Invest Directly in AI?\nYes, you can directly invest in AI and machine learning by investing in individual stocks or in ETFs or mutual funds that focus on AI stocks. Conservative investors wondering which AI stocks to buy might consider established companies that are benefiting from AI processes, while aggressive investors can seek out investments in direct AI companies. For AI investing ideas, check out the best AI stocks. This list is updated monthly. \nThe Bottom Line \nInvesting in AI in 2024 offers compelling prospects for your portfolio. The technology continues to seep into the media, healthcare, automotive, finance, and other sectors. \nHowever, you'll have to navigate challenges that could include potential legal and regulatory changes, supply shortages, and the broader political and ethical considerations concerning the widespread deployment of AI systems and the ecological effects of powering them. \nSimilar to investing in the new internet and computing industries decades ago, the winners and losers can change on a dime. Staying informed and selectively investing in companies prioritizing robust business models will be crucial for those looking to capitalize on the AI boom while mitigating risks.\nYour Homebuying Benefits Are Ready\nVeterans & Military Families: Now more than ever, it’s important to check eligibility for your hard-earned VA loan benefits.

  "text": "Sector Breakdown: What It Is and How It's Used\nWhat Is a Sector Breakdown? \nA sector breakdown is the mix of industry sectors, like technology or healthcare, held by a fund or portfolio, typically expressed as a percentage. Sector designations can vary depending on the fund’s investment criteria and overall objective. \nKey Takeaways\nThe sector breakdown of a portfolio shows how much asset weights are allocated to what industry sectors.\nSectors are broad classifications such as consumer staples, healthcare, or technology.\nA well-diversified portfolio includes investments in multiple sectors.\nInvestopedia / Eliana Rodgers\nSector Investing \nA sector breakdown can help an investor observe the investment allocations of a fund. Fund companies regularly provide sector reporting in their marketing materials. Sector investing can influence investments in the fund. A fund may target a specific sector such as technology, or seek to diversify among many sectors. \nSome funds may have restraints on sector investments. This may occur with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) focused funds. These funds seek to exclude industries or companies that their investors consider undesirable for various reasons such as tobacco producers or oil exploration companies. \nA sector fund allocates 100% to a specified sector, such as healthcare, technology, or energy.\nGICS \nThe Global Industry Classification Standard, also known as GICS, is the primary financial industry standard for defining sector classifications. GICS was developed by index providers MSCI and the S&P Dow Jones. Its hierarchy begins with 11 sectors which can be further delineated to 25 industry groups, 74 industries, and 163 sub-industries. It follows a coding system that assigns a code from each grouping to every company publicly traded in the market.1 \n11 Sectors \nThe eleven sectors defined by GICS include: \nEnergy\nMaterials\nIndustrials\nConsumer Discretionary\nConsumer Staples\nHealth Care\nFinancials\nInformation Technology\nTelecommunication Services\nUtilities\nReal Estate\nDiversification \nA diversified stock portfolio will hold stocks across most GICS sectors. Diversification across stock sectors helps to mitigate idiosyncratic or unsystematic risks caused by factors affecting specific industries or companies within an industry. Sector indexes can be used by investors seeking to invest in the growth prospects of a single sector. \nInvestment companies offer passive index funds that seek to replicate each of the eleven GICS sectors. The Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund is one example of a passively managed mutual fund that replicates the holdings of the MSCI U.S. Investable Market Information Technology Index.2 \nWhat Is the Five Percent Rule?\nA well-diversified portfolio includes as many sectors as possible and does not concentrate too many funds into a single sector or related sectors. Investors can employ the five percent rule with sector funds. To diversify within specialty sectors, such as biotech, commercial real estate, or gold miners, investors keep their allocation to 5% or less for each.\nWhat Industries Are Included in the Energy Sector?\nThe Energy Sector includes companies that target oil, gas, coal, and consumable fuels through exploration and production, refining and marketing, and storage and transportation. The sector also includes companies that offer oil and gas equipment and services.3\nHow Are Companies Classified Under GICS?\nEvery company is assigned a GICS classification at the sub-industry level\naccording to its primary business activity. MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices use revenues and earnings to determine a company's principal business.4\nThe Bottom Line \nSectors are broad classifications such as consumer staples, healthcare, or technology. The Global Industry Classification Standard is the primary financial industry standard for defining sector classifications. The sector breakdown of a portfolio shows how much asset weights are allocated to what industry sectors and are commonly expressed as a percentage. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Dunning-Kruger Effect: Meaning and Examples in Finance\nWhat Is the Dunning-Kruger Effect? \nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias first described by psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger in 1999. It occurs when people with low levels of knowledge, skill, or competence in a particular field overestimate their own ability and knowledge.1 \nPut differently, people who don’t know what they’re talking about tend to (incorrectly) think they do know what they’re talking about. At the same time, experts in a field may underestimate their own knowledge and competence. This part of why Dunning and Kruger’s findings are similar to imposter syndrome, whereby high achievers begin to doubt their abilities.2 \nIn finance and investing, people who overestimate their knowledge and ability because of the Dunning-Kruger Effect may make unwise or overly risky investment decisions that can result in significant losses. This can happen, for example, when people feel confident in their ability to predict market trends or understand complex financial instruments, despite lacking the necessary expertise. \nKey Takeaways\nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect is a psychological phenomenon in which people with low levels of skill or knowledge greatly overestimate their perceived skills of knowledge.\nThose who score the worst on actual performance or knowledge are often the same ones who rate themselves most highly and confident in their (incorrect) claims.\nAt the same time, those individuals with actual skill or knowledge tend to underestimate their abilities in a phenomenon called imposter syndrome.\nFirst described in a 1999 research paper, the Dunning-Kruger Effect has been replicated many times. It can affect many life aspects, including investing decisions.1\nMinimizing the Dunning-Kruger Effect can be achieved through education, training, accepting criticism and feedback, and taking in objective evaluations of knowledge or ability.\nWhy the Dunning-Kruger Effect Happens \nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect is thought to occur due to a combination of cognitive limitations and a lack of subjective self-awareness. Individuals with limited knowledge or expertise in a field are often unaware of their own limitations, which can result in an inflated sense of competence. \nIn other words, when someone doesn’t know what they don’t know, they are prone to overestimate their knowledge. It has been described colloquially as “dumb people who do not realize they are dumb.”3 At the same time, those with more expertise may come to underestimate their abilities as they become more aware of the complexities of their field. \nThe phenomenon was first described in a 1999 study titled “Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments,” by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger.1\nAnother reason for the effect could be a lack of insight or metacognition, which is the capacity to reflect honestly and objectively on one’s own skills or performance. If someone consistently overestimates their abilities, they may also be more likely to reject feedback, which can play a role in continued underperformance. \nIn addition, the effect may occur as people use their own subjective criteria for what it means to be good at something, rather than objective, standardized measures. \nThe authors discovered that people with low levels of competence in a particular domain were more likely to overestimate their abilities, while those with higher levels of competence were more likely to underestimate their abilities, forming an inverted U-shaped plot. Dunning and Kruger assessed participants’ actual and perceived abilities in a disparate range of fields including humor, logical reasoning, and English grammar. \nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect is a type of cognitive bias. Many similar psychological biases affect financial investors, including representative bias, cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, attachment bias, home-country bias, anchoring bias, and the endowment effect.\nIn the grammar study, college students completed a test on American Standard Written English, then self-evaluated their perceived grammar ability and expected test performance. Those who scored the lowest on the test tended to drastically overestimate both their perceived grammar ability and expected test score, while those who scored highest tended to underestimate their ability and test score.1 \nComparing self-assessments (subjective ability) with actual performance (objective ability) remains the primary way to detect and measure the Dunning-Kruger Effect. A 2008 study replicated the original findings, showing that people in the lower quarter in terms of actual performance expected to see results of 60% when they scored only 38.4%.4 \nPeople in the middle half expected to score 72.6% but actually scored 61.7%. Meanwhile, those in the upper quarter expected to score 75.6% and actually scored higher, averaging 84.1%.4 Several other studies have also replicated these general findings across various contexts. \nDunning and Kruger’s findings show that as an individual’s actual competence increases, the disparity between self-assessment and actual performance decreases, eventually leading to a more accurate self-assessment.4\nImpact of the Dunning-Kruger Effect \nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect affects individuals across various fields, including business, finance, medicine, and politics. It can often lead to poor decision making, inefficiency, and other negative outcomes. \nDunning-Kruger Effect in the Workplace \nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect can manifest in the form of employees taking on tasks beyond their actual skill set or making decisions without fully understanding the ramifications or possible knock-on effects. Additionally, people who suffer from the effect may reject feedback or constructive criticism because they remain convinced of their own abilities and defend the choices that they have made. This can lead to a lack of growth and development, as well as difficulty working collaboratively with others. \nOne potential pitfall is that hiring managers may erroneously hire bad candidates who appear confident during the interview process but are actually victims of the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Similarly, promotions may be handed out to these types of employees for similar reasons. \nDunning-Kruger Effect in Business and Finance \nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect can significantly affect financial decisions and investment strategies. Inexperienced investors may overestimate their abilities to pick stocks, analyze companies, or predict market trends, leading to poor investment choices and potential financial losses. This also includes a failure to recognize risks that may be present but are not recognized. \nPeople who overestimate their abilities may ignore expert advice, such as from a financial advisor, especially if that advice goes against their preconceived notions.\nDunning-Kruger Effect in Medicine \nIn medicine, this effect can lead to healthcare professionals overestimating their knowledge and making incorrect diagnoses or treatment recommendations. This can take the form of missing a critical diagnosis or failing to order the appropriate tests, leading to delayed treatment or even a misdiagnosis. This, of course, can have serious consequences for patient care and health outcomes. \nHow to Avoid the Dunning-Kruger Effect \nTo guard against the Dunning-Kruger Effect, it’s important to seek out diverse perspectives, recognize one’s own limitations, and be open to feedback and constructive criticism. Being both humble and realistic about one’s actual abilities and knowledge may be difficult, but it is critical for avoiding the pitfalls described above. \nEngaging with colleagues, mentors, and subject matter experts can also help build a more accurate understanding of one’s knowledge and abilities and can help avoid costly mistakes. Don’t assume that you are superior or know more than those with expert training and credentials in a field. Indeed, education and training are the best way to gain the actual knowledge base needed to make expert claims. \nFurthermore, healthcare organizations can establish clear guidelines and protocols for decision-making processes that individuals must follow regardless of what they think they know, and provide opportunities for professionals to collaborate and share their knowledge and expertise. \nWhat is the ‘double curse’ of the Dunning-Kruger Effect?\nThe “double curse” of the Dunning-Kruger Effect arises when:\nLow-skilled people greatly overestimate their own skills or knowledge\nHigh-skilled people tend to underestimate their own skills or knowledge\nIs the Dunning-Kruger Effect real?\nSince the original study by Kruger and Dunning in 1999, several studies have replicated and supported the existence of their namesake effect across various domains.1 However, some scholars have questioned the statistical modeling used in the original study and criticized the overapplication of the theory to a range of situations where it might not be relevant.3 Despite these criticisms, the Dunning-Kruger Effect remains widely recognized as a genuine cognitive bias that can influence people’s perceptions of their own skills and knowledge.\nWhat is the opposite of the Dunning-Kruger Effect?\nWhile there is no exact opposite of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, imposter syndrome may be used to describe the fact that highly trained and skilled people may underestimate their own ability or worth. Imposter syndrome occurs when those who are competent and accomplished nevertheless feel like they are frauds or imposters who don’t deserve their success. This can lead to feelings of self-doubt, anxiety, and a fear of being exposed as a fraud.2\nWho is most susceptible to imposter syndrome?\nImpostor syndrome can affect anyone, regardless of their profession, background, or level of achievement. However, it is commonly associated with high-achieving individuals, perfectionists, and/or those in competitive environments who may come to doubt their own abilities.\nThe Bottom Line \nFirst identified in 1999 by a pair of psychologists, the Dunning-Kruger Effect describes a ubiquitous phenomenon among people in which those with low skill or knowledge tend to greatly overestimate their skills and knowledge. Conversely, those with great skill or knowledge tend to underestimate themselves instead. \nThe impact of the Dunning-Kruger Effect spans many domains and contexts, and in the world of business and investment can lead to poor hiring and promotion decisions, overconfidence, bad trading strategies, and excessive risk taking, among other detrimental effects. To minimize the Dunning-Kruger Effect, one can educate or train themselves to become an expert in a field, listen to knowledgeable advice and feedback, and be open to new ideas. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "The Costs of Investing\nAll investments carry costs—real costs—not merely the opportunity costs of an investor choosing to forego one asset in favor of another. Rather, these costs and comparisons are not that dissimilar to those consumers face when shopping for a car. \nUnfortunately, many investors ignore critical investment costs because they can be confusing or obscured by fine print and jargon. But they don't have to be. The first step is understanding the different types of costs. \nKey Takeaways\nInvesting involves real costs, which reduce any returns you might get on your investments.\nSavvy investors know how to minimize investment costs in order to maximize their gains.\nCommon investing costs include expense ratios, market costs, custodian fees, advisory fees, commissions, and loads.\nWays to reduce investment costs include knowing when to buy and hold, understanding tax implications, and using tax-exempt or tax-deferred investments.\nTypes of Investing Costs \nDifferent investments carry different types of costs. For example, all mutual funds—one of the most common investment instruments—charge what’s called an expense ratio. This is a measure of what it costs to manage the fund expressed as a percentage. \nIt is based on the total assets invested in the fund and is calculated annually. This fee is typically paid out of fund assets, so you won’t be billed for it, but it will come out of your returns. That means if the mutual fund returns 8% and the expense ratio is 1.5%, you’ve really only earned 6.5% on your shares. \nThere are two problems with a high expense ratio. First, a higher portion of your money is going to the management team instead of to you. Second, the more money the management team charges, the more difficult it is for the fund to match or beat the market’s performance. \nIronically, many higher-cost funds claim they’re worth the extra cost because they enjoy stronger performance. But, expense ratios, like a leak in a bathtub, slowly drain some of the assets. Therefore, the more money management takes out in the form of fees, the better the fund must perform to earn back what’s been deducted. \nMarketing Costs \nMoreover, in some cases, these fees help pay for marketing or distribution costs. This means that you are paying managers to promote a fund to other potential investors. This particular cost is called a 12b-1 fee.1 \nAnnual and Custodian Fees \nAnnual fees are often low, about $25 to $90 a year, but every dollar adds up. Custodian fees usually apply to retirement accounts (e.g., IRAs) and cover costs associated with fulfilling IRS reporting regulations. You can expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $50 per year.\nLoads and Commissions \nA front-end load is a fee charged when you buy shares, a back-end load is a fee incurred when selling. Commissions are essentially fees that are paid to the broker for their services. \nAs you can see, the financial world has not made it easy to untangle all of these complex and often hidden expenses; however, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken steps to clarify these costs for investors. \nIn an effort to protect retail investors, the SEC, in its 2018 priority list, indicated its intent to “focus on firms that have practices or business models that may create increased risks that investors will pay inadequately disclosed fees, expenses, or other charges.”2 \nIn other words, the SEC planned to take aim at firms that engage in practices like receiving compensation for recommending specific securities, ignoring accounts when the assigned manager has left the firm, and changing fee structures from commission-only to a percentage of client assets under management. \nWhile the SEC plays a valuable role in safeguarding investors, the best defense against excessive or unwarranted fees is doing careful research and asking plenty of questions. Taking the time to understand what you’re paying is critical because fees, over the long term, rob investors of their wealth. \nOther Costs \nSome mutual funds include other costs, like purchase and redemption fees, which are a percentage of the amount you’re buying or selling. \nWhy Investing Fees Matter \nFees almost always appear deceptively low. An investor might see an expense ratio of 2% and dismiss it as inconsequential. But it’s not. A fee expressed as a percentage doesn’t reveal to investors the dollars they’ll actually be spending, and more importantly how those dollars will grow. \nJust as compounding delivers growing returns to long-term investors, high fees do exactly the opposite; a static cost rises exponentially over time.\nThe result may be anchoring bias, in which irrelevant information is used to evaluate or estimate something of unknown values. Simply put, everything is relative. This means that if our first exposure to investing involves excessive fees, we may view all subsequent expenses as low even though they are, in fact, high.\nScenario 1 \nSuppose you have an investment account worth $80,000. You hold the investment for 25 years, earning 7% per year and paying 0.50% in annual fees. At the end of the 25-year period, you’ll have approximately $386,000. \nScenario 2 \nNow, consider the same scenario, but with one difference; you aren’t paying attention to costs and you hand over 2.0% annually. After 25 years you’re left with approximately $271,000. That “tiny” 2.0% cost you $115,000. \nBrokerage Fees Come in All Shapes and Sizes \nAccount Maintenance Fee \nThis is usually an annual or monthly fee charged for the use of the brokerage firm and its research tools. This fee is occasionally tiered. Those who want to use more robust data and analytic tools pay more. \nSales Load \nAs mentioned above, some mutual funds include a load or a commission paid to the broker who sold you the fund. Be wary of these charges for two reasons. First, many mutual funds today are no-load and are therefore cheaper alternatives. Second, some brokers will push funds with larger loads to pad revenue. \nAdvisory Fee \nThis is also sometimes referred to as a management fee for the expertise the broker brings to the table in the form of wealth strategies. This cost is a percentage of the total assets the investor has under the broker's management. \nExpense Ratio \nAs discussed earlier, this is a fee charged by those managing the mutual fund. \nCommissions \nThese are common and they add up fast. As mentioned above, commission fees are the cost of executing any buy or sell trade. This payment goes directly to the broker. This cost usually ranges from $1 to $5 per trade and, in some cases, will be waived if the investor reaches an account minimum. Occasionally this fee is calculated as a percentage of the value of the trade. \nRemember that full-service brokers who provide complex services and products like estate planning, tax advice, and annuities, will often charge higher fees. Fees range between 0.5% and 1.0% of the value of the assets managed. \nThe burden of expensive fees becomes greater over a longer period. Therefore, young investors just getting started face a bigger risk because the total dollars lost to costs will grow exponentially over the decades. For this reason, it’s particularly important to pay attention to costs in accounts that you will hold for a long period of time. \nActive vs. Passive Management \nPassive management describes investments like mutual funds that are designed to replicate market indexes like the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000. The managers of these funds only change the holdings if the benchmarked fund changes. Passive management seeks to match the market’s return. \nAn example of actively managed funds is hedge funds, which seek to significantly outperform the market; however, studies have shown that hedge funds still can't beat the S&P 500.3\nIn contrast, an active management strategy is a more involved approach, with fund managers making a concerted effort to outperform the market. Not happy with simply matching the return of the S&P 500, they want to make strategic moves that seek to exploit the value of unrecognized opportunity in the market. \nDifferent Costs \nActive and passive funds carry different costs. The average fee for actively managed funds in 2023 was 0.42%, whereas passive mutual funds averaged just 0.05%. Despite a continued decline since the 1990s, it's important to note that as the total amount of assets in an actively managed fund decreases, these funds, in general, raise the expense ratio.4 \nAs one study from ICI Research determined, “During the 2007–2009 financial crisis, actively managed domestic equity mutual fund assets decreased markedly, leading their expense ratios to rise in 2009.”5 \nThis finding underscores an important truth: Expense ratios are often not tied to performance. Instead, they’re tied to the total value of assets under management. If the assets decrease—usually due to poor performance—the managers will simply raise their prices. \nSome investors will argue that “you get what you pay for.” In other words, while an active fund may charge more, the higher returns are worth the expense because investors will earn back the fee and then some. In fact, these advocates for active management occasionally have the annual performance to back up such claims. There is, however, often a problem with this assertion: survivorship bias. \nSurvivorship Bias \nSurvivorship bias is the skewing effect that occurs when mutual funds merge with other funds or undergo liquidation. Why does this matter? Because “when funds are merged into other funds or liquidated, and...tend to be underperformers…this skews the average results upward for the surviving funds, causing them to appear to perform better relative to a benchmark,” according to research at Vanguard.6 \nOf course, there are some actively managed funds that do outperform without the help of survivorship bias. The question here is do they outperform regularly? The answer is no. The same body of research from Vanguard shows that \"on average and over time, active managers as a group fail to outperform.\" \nThe researchers looked at two separate, sequential, non-overlapping five-year periods. These funds were ranked into five quintiles based on their excess return ranking. Ultimately, they determined that while some managers did consistently outperform their benchmark, “those active managers are extremely rare.”7 \nMoreover, it is nearly impossible for an investor to identify these consistent performers before they become consistent performers. In attempting to do so, many will look at previous results for clues on future performance; however, a critical tenet of investing is that past returns are no predictor of future gains. \nWays To Minimize Investing Costs \nKnow When To Buy and Hold \nThe more you move money around, the more costs accrue. As discussed above, there are fees and charges associated with buying and selling. Like a pail of water passed from one person to another, each successive hand-off causes a little spill. Moreover, buy-and-hold strategies typically yield better returns than those based on frequent trading. \nConsider Tax Implications \nThis is the most ignored aspect of investing costs. It's also the most complicated. Even seasoned investors find it beneficial to get help from a professional when it comes to taxes. The savings generated often more than compensate for the professional's fee. \nFor example, many investors are unaware that realized losses on investments—that is, money lost after selling a stock for less than it cost, can be used to offset taxable gains. This is called tax-loss harvesting. \nOrdinarily, an investor will pay either a long-term capital gains tax (securities held over one year) or short-term capital gains tax (securities held for less than one year). If it's a long-term capital gain the investor will pay either 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on their income level and their filing status (single, married filing jointly, married filing separately).8 \nShort-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. These rates range from 10% to 37% again, depending on your income level and filing status.9 \nTax-Deferred or Tax-Exempt Accounts \nInvestors might be surprised to see how much they hold on to with a tax-deferred, or tax-exempt account. Tax-deferred accounts, which safeguard investments from taxes as long as the assets remain untouched, include 401(k)s and traditional IRAs. These account options are great ways to save big on burdensome taxes. \nHowever, there’s a catch. As mentioned earlier, you’ll lose the tax advantage (and get hit with penalty costs) if you withdraw money early; before the age of 59½. Younger investors should consider Roth IRA accounts. Provided you have owned the Roth for five years, both earnings and withdrawals made after 59½ are tax-free. These are great ways to save over the long term if you know you won’t need to touch the money.10 \nWhat Fees Do You Pay When Investing?\nCommon fees investors incur when investing are expense ratios, investment management/advisory fees, transaction fees, load fees, surrender charges, commissions, account fees, and custodian fees.\nHow Can I Avoid Investment Fees?\nTo avoid or reduce investment fees, start out with no-fee brokers. Most online brokers now do not charge fees or commissions for transacting buy and sell orders of stocks. Utilize low-cost index funds with low expense ratios. Similarly, choose no-load mutual funds. Using a free robo-advisor can also be a good strategy.\nHow Do Fees Impact My Investment?\nFees impact investments by creating costs that reduce the returns an individual has achieved on their investment. This is particularly true if an investor buys and sells often and each transaction has a fee. It is also true if a long-term investor has to pay an annual fee for their investment portfolio. Small fees add up over time.\nThe Bottom Line \nDo your homework. We live in times of unprecedented access to information. While some investments may obscure their costs in the fine print, anyone can quickly get to the bottom line with the wealth of information available online. There’s no excuse for investing in an asset without knowing the full costs and making the choices that are right for you.",

  "text": "Short-Term Investments: Definition, How They Work, and Examples\nWhat Are Short-Term Investments? \nShort-term investments, also known as marketable securities or temporary investments, are financial investments that can easily be converted to cash, typically within five years. Many short-term investments are sold or converted to cash after a period of only three-12 months. Some common examples of short-term investments include CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and Treasury bills. Usually, these investments are high-quality and highly liquid assets or investment vehicles. \nShort-term investments may also refer specifically to financial assets—of a similar kind, but with a few additional requirements—that are owned by a company. Recorded in a separate account, and listed in the current assets section of the corporate balance sheet, short-term investments in this context are investments that a company has made that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. \nShort-term investments can be contrasted with long-term investments. \nKey Takeaways\nShort-term investments, also known as marketable securities or temporary investments, are financial investments that can easily be converted to cash, typically within 5 years.\nShort-term investments can also refer to the holdings a company owns but intends to sell within a year.\nCommon examples of short-term investments include CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and Treasury bills.\nAlthough short-term investments typically offer lower rates of return, they are highly liquid and give investors the flexibility to withdraw money quickly, if needed.\nAny increases or decreases in the value of a company's short-term investments are directly reflected on a company's income statement for the quarter.\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\nHow Short-Term Investments Work \nThe goal of a short-term investment—for both companies and individual or institutional investors—is to protect capital while also generating a return similar to a Treasury bill index fund or another similar benchmark. \nCompanies in a strong cash position will have a short-term investments account on their balance sheet. As a result, the company can afford to invest excess cash in stocks, bonds, or cash equivalents to earn higher interest than what would be earned from a normal savings account. \nThere are two basic requirements for a company to classify an investment as short-term. First, it must be liquid, like a stock listed on a major exchange that trades frequently or U.S. Treasury bonds. Second, the management must intend to sell the security within a relatively short period, such as 12 months. Marketable debt securities, aka \"short-term paper,\" that mature within a year or less, such as U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper, also count as short-term investments.12 \nMarketable equity securities include investments in common and preferred stock. Marketable debt securities can include corporate bonds—that is, bonds issued by another company—but they also need to have short maturity dates and should be actively traded to be considered liquid.3 \nShort-Term Investments vs. Long-Term Investments \nUnlike long-term investments, which are designed to be bought and held for a period of at least a year, short-term investments are bought knowing they will be quickly sold.4 Typically, long-term investors are willing to accept a higher level of volatility or risk, with the idea that these \"bumps\" will eventually smooth out over a long period—as long as, of course, the investment is growing in a positive trajectory \nLong-term investments are also used by individuals that are able to stow away their money and don't have immediate needs for it (such as to buy a car or a house).5\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Short-Term Investments \nShort-term investments help ground an investor's portfolio. Although they typically offer lower rates of return compared to investing in an index fund over time, they are highly liquid investments that give investors the flexibility of making money they can withdraw quickly, if needed.1 \nFor a business, long-term investments are not counted as income until they are sold. This means that companies that decide to hold or invest in short-term investments count any fluctuations in price at the market rate. This means short-term investments that decline in value are marked down as a loss for the company on the income statement.67 \nPros\nShort-term investment gains are reflected directly on the income statement.\nShort-term investments take on lower risk, making them stable options.\nShort-term investments help diversify income types, in case of market volatility.\nCons\nShort-term investments typically have lower rates of return.\nAny declines in value of a short-term investment will directly affect the net income of a business.\nExamples of Short-Term Investments \nSome common short-term investments and strategies used by corporations and individual investors include: \nCertificates of deposit¡ (CDs): These deposits are offered by banks and typically pay a higher interest rate because they lock up cash for a given period. These periods usually range from several months up to five years. They are FDIC-insured for up to $250,000.8\nMoney market accounts: Returns on these FDIC-insured accounts will beat those on savings accounts, but require a minimum investment. Keep in mind that money market accounts differ from money market mutual funds, which are not FDIC-insured.910\nTreasuries: There are a variety of these government-issued bonds, such as notes, bills, floating-rate notes, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).11\nBond funds: Offered by professional asset managers/investment companies, these funds are better for a shorter time frame and can offer better-than-average returns for the risk. Just be aware of the fees.12\nMunicipal bonds: These bonds, issued by local, state, or non-federal government agencies, can offer higher yields and tax advantages since they are often exempt from income taxes.13\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending: Excess cash can be put into play via one of these lending platforms that match borrowers to lenders.14\nRoth IRAs: For individuals, these vehicles can offer flexibility and a variety of investment options. Contributions, but not gains, to Roth IRAs can be withdrawn at any time, without penalty or taxes due.15\nIf you have excess cash, using it to pay off higher-interest debt may be more advantageous than investing it in low-risk but low-return short-term investments.16\nReal-World Example of Short-Term Investments \nOn its quarterly statement dated Apr. 21, 2022, Microsoft Corp. reported holding $92.2 billion of short-term investments on its balance sheet. The biggest component was U.S. government securities, which was $78.4 billion. This was followed by corporate notes/bonds worth $11.7 billion, mortgage/asset-backed securities at $590 million, foreign government bonds worth $501 million, municipal securities at $269 million, and certificates of deposit (CDs) at $2 billion.17 \nWhat Are the Best Short-Term Investments?\nSome of the best short-term investment options include short-dated CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and Treasury bills. Check their current interest rates or rates of return to discover which is best for you.\nWhere Can I Invest for 6 Months?\nCommon short-term investment vehicles include six-month CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and Treasury bills.1\nWhat Is the Best Way to Invest $5,000?\nBased on experience and risk tolerance, investors will differ on this question. However, many financial analysts will say the best way to invest $5,000 is to put it in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 and keep it for the long run.\nWhat Can You Invest in With Little Money?\nIndividuals with only a little bit of cash have a lot of options. They can put the money in any investments that don't require a minimum balance, such as certain savings accounts, fractional shares of an index fund, or even cheaper stocks, bonds, and CDs.\nThe Bottom Line \nShort-term investments can be great investments for individual investors and corporations who are looking for both liquid and stable options to grow their wealth. The options are plenty: from CDs to bonds and high-yield savings accounts, it's only up to each investor to do their homework. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Investment Banker: What They Do, Required Skills, and Examples\nWhat Is an Investment Banker? \nInvestment bankers are financial professionals who advise corporations, as well as governments or other entities. They help these clients raise capital (money) by issuing shares of stock or offering bonds. Investment bankers also can assist clients with financial transactions such acquisitions, mergers, and even the sale of the company.\nKey Takeaways:\nAn investment banker works for a financial institution and is primarily concerned with raising capital for corporations, governments, or other entities.\nThe investment banking field is popular because it is typically well-paid.\nInvestment bankers must have excellent number-crunching abilities, strong verbal and written communication skills, and the capacity to work long hours when necessary.\nInvestopedia / Jake Shi\nInvestment Banker Role and Responsibilities \nInvestment bankers facilitate large, complicated financial transactions. These transactions may include structuring an acquisition, merger, or sale for clients. Another responsibility of investment bankers is issuing securities as a means of raising capital. This involves creating detailed documentation for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) necessary for a company to go public. \nAn investment banker can save a client time and money by identifying the risks associated with a particular project before a company moves forward. In theory, the investment banker is an expert in their field or industry, who has a finger on the pulse of the current investing climate. Businesses and nonprofit institutions often turn to investment bankers for advice on how best to plan their development. \nAn investment banker also assists with pricing financial instruments and navigating regulatory requirements. When a company holds its initial public offering (IPO), an investment bank will buy all or much of that company’s shares directly, acting as an intermediary. In this case, acting on behalf of the company going public, the investment bank will subsequently sell the company’s shares into the public market, creating immediate liquidity.\nAn investment bank stands to make a profit in this scenario, generally pricing its shares at a markup. While experienced analysts at the investment bank use their expertise to price the stock accurately, an investment banker can lose money on the deal if they have overvalued the shares. \nInvestment bankers and their firms take on a high level of risk during an IPO. They must have a strong sense of the market and the industry in which their clients are positioned to decide whether the risk is worth the potential profit.\nAn Example of Investment Banking and an IPO \nWhen a company works with an investment banker for the IPO, the investment banker's firm buys the shares from the client at an agreed-upon price, based on how the firm's analysts value the company and how much they expect shares of the stock to be worth. Then, on the day of the IPO, the firm sells those shares to the public at a higher price than it paid to make a profit.\nAs an example, suppose that Pete’s Paints Co. wants to go public. Pete, the owner, gets in touch with Catherine, a prominent investment banker. Pete and Catherine strike a deal in which Catherine (on behalf of her firm) agrees to buy 100,000 shares of Pete’s Paints for the company’s IPO at the price of $24 per share, based on her analyst team's recommendations. The investment bank pays $2.4 million for the 100,000 shares. \nAfter filing the appropriate paperwork, such as SEC Form S-1, and setting the IPO's date and time, Catherine and her team offer the stock into the open market at $26 per share. \nIf the market supports the $26 per share price, Catherine's firm would make $2.6 million from the IPO, for a profit of $200,000. However, if public demand is weak, the firm might not be able to sell all the shares at this price. Catherine and her team would be forced to reduce the price to sell the rest of the holdings. In this case, the firm could incur a loss on the sale, but Pete's Paints Co. would still receive $2.4 million. \nRequired Skills for Investment Bankers \nThe investment banking field is popular because investment bankers are typically well paid. However, these positions require specific skills, such as: \nStrong numeracy\nStrong verbal and written communication skills\nTraining and experience in the investment/financial world\nExpert knowledge about a client's industry\nThe capacity to work long hours, particularly early in a career\nInvestment bankers must abide by their firm's stipulated code of conduct and ethics. Because of the sensitive nature of the information they receive, they must typically sign a confidentiality agreement for each client. Moreover, there is potential for conflict of interest if the advisory and trading divisions of investment banks interact. \nA hierarchy of positions typically exists in investment banking. These positions usually go from analyst (from junior to senior), associate, vice president, senior vice president, and then managing director. \nWhat Degree Do You Need to Be an Investment Banker?\nEducational requirements for investment bankers usually include an MBA from a top-notch institution, and some may have an advanced degree in mathematics. They may also need the chartered financial analyst (CFA) designation, which is offered by the CFA institute.1\nHow Much Does an Investment Banker Make?\nAn investment banking analyst, which is the lowest level of investment banker, can expect an average annual pay of $137,000 to $235,000 in 2024.2 More experienced investment bankers can earn much higher salaries, depending on their firm and clients. Many investment bankers receive bonuses, tips, or profit-sharing as part of their pay.\nWhere Do Investment Bankers Work?\nInvestment bankers often work as part of a financial institution. Examples of investment banker employers are Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC), and Deutsche Bank (DB).\nThe Bottom Line \nInvestment bankers are financial advisors who work with corporations, governments, and other large entities. They assist clients with raising capital, often through stock offerings or floating a bond issue. They can also assist with major financial transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, or the sale of a company. \nInvestment bankers usually have an MBA or an advanced degree in mathematics, usually from a highly-ranked university. They work for a financial institution and are highly compensated, with annual salaries (plus bonuses) that are typically worth six figures. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading. The USD Interest account on Uphold allows you to maximize your USD by earning 4.90% APY* on amounts over $1,000 and 2% on smaller balances. Start earning interest in as little as one business day.

  "text": "The Top 25 Investing Quotes of All Time\nWhen it comes to the world of investing, most people don't know where to start. Fortunately, great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance. These investment quotes date back to Benjamin Franklin, and some are from modern experts like Dave Ramsey and Warren Buffett. The 25 quotes here were selected for their enduring value. Although markets may change, this investing advice is timeless. \nKey Takeaways\nTimeless financial quotes give investors a better perspective on the future by conveying wisdom from the past.\nThe best stock market quotes teach investors how success in the market depends on playing the odds instead of following natural instincts.\nInvestment and wealth quotes show how to build a fortune in the long run and spend it wisely.\nThe top investing quotes from contrarians tell investors how they can profit by going against popular opinion.\nTimeless Financial Quotes \n1. \"An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.\" — Benjamin Franklin \nWhen it comes to investing, nothing will pay off more than educating yourself. Do the necessary research and analysis before making any investment decisions.1 \n2. \"Bottoms in the investment world don't end with four-year lows; they end with 10- or 15-year lows.\" — Jim Rogers \nWhile 10- to 15-year lows are not common, they do happen. During these times, don't be shy about going against the trend and investing; you could make a fortune by making a bold move or lose your shirt. Remember the first quote in this article and invest in an industry you've researched thoroughly. Then, be prepared to see your investment sink lower before it turns around and starts to pay off.2 \n3. \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.\" — Warren Buffett \nBe prepared to invest in a down market and to \"get out\" in a soaring market, as per the philosophy of Warren Buffett.3 \n4. \"With a good perspective on history, we can have a better understanding of the past and present, and thus a clear vision of the future.\" — Carlos Slim Helu \nIt's far too easy for investors to lose perspective. Whenever something big goes wrong, a lot of people panic and sell their investments. Looking at history, the markets recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, the dotcom crash, and even the Great Depression, so they'll probably get through whatever comes next as well.4 \nBest Stock Market Quotes \n5. \"It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.\" — George Soros \nToo many investors become obsessed with being right, even when the gains are small. Winning big and cutting your losses when you're wrong is more important than being right.5 \n6. \"Given a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time.\" — Jeff Bezos \nMost people dismiss many of the best and most profitable investment ideas simply because they probably won't work. These investors never stop to consider how much they could make if unlikely outcomes actually occur. Jeff Bezos took those bets and became one of the richest people in the world.6 \n7. \"Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!\" — John Bogle \nIf it seems too hard to find the next Amazon, John Bogle came up with the only sure way to get in on the action. By buying an index fund, investors can put a little bit of money into every stock. That way, they never miss out on the stock market's biggest winners.7 \n8. \"To the extent we have been successful, it is because we concentrated on identifying one-foot hurdles that we could step over rather than because we acquired any ability to clear seven-footers.\" — Warren Buffett \nInvestors often make things too hard for themselves. The value stocks that Buffett prefers frequently outperform the market, making success easier. Supposedly sophisticated strategies, such as short selling, lose money in the long run, so profiting is much more difficult.8 \n9. \"The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.\" — Phillip Fisher \nThat is another testament to the fact that investing without education and research will ultimately lead to regrettable investment decisions. Research is much more than just listening to popular opinion.1 \n10. \"In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable.\" — Robert Arnott \nAt times, you will have to step out of your comfort zone to realize significant gains. Know the boundaries of your comfort zone and practice stepping out of it in small doses. As much as you need to know the market, you need to know yourself too. Can you handle staying in when everyone else is jumping ship? Or getting out during the biggest rally of the century? There's no room for pride in this kind of self-analysis. The best investment strategy can turn into the worst if you don't have the stomach to see it through.9 \n11. \"How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case.\" — Robert G. Allen \nThough investing in a savings account is a sure bet, your gains will be minimal due to the extremely low interest rates. But don't forgo one completely. A savings account is a reliable place for an emergency fund, whereas a market investment is not.1 \n12. \"If there is one common theme to the vast range of the world’s financial crises, it is that excessive debt accumulation, whether by the government, banks, corporations, or consumers, often poses greater systemic risks than it seems during a boom.\" — Carmen Reinhart \nBeware of debts that seem sensible during periods of prosperity. When a crisis comes, individuals, companies, and even governments that ran up debts during the boom usually suffer the most.10 \n13. \"We don't prognosticate macroeconomic factors, we're looking at our companies from a bottom-up perspective on their long-run prospects of returning.\" — Mellody Hobson \nIt's very difficult to predict when the next recession or stock market crash will come, so many of the best investors don't even try. Instead, look for good companies with the strength to make it through the occasional challenging economic environment.11 \n14. \"Courage taught me no matter how bad a crisis gets ... any sound investment will eventually pay off.\" — Carlos Slim Helu \nDon't despair amid the inevitable setbacks that all investors face, especially during a crisis in the market. If the reasoning behind the investment is sound, stick with it, and it should eventually turn around.4 \n15. \"The individual investor should act consistently as an investor and not as a speculator.\" — Ben Graham \nYou are an investor, not someone who can predict the future. Base your decisions on real facts and analysis rather than risky, speculative forecasts.5 \nInvestment and Wealth Quotes \n16. \"The biggest risk of all is not taking one.\" — Mellody Hobson \nThere is a direct tradeoff between risk and returns. If investors stick to low-risk assets like the money market and bonds, then they run a high risk of low long-term returns.12 \n17. \"Returns matter a lot. It's our capital.\" — Abigail Johnson \nThe long-run rate of return on investments ultimately determines how much wealth people accumulate over time. Always look at returns when considering mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).13 \n18. \"It's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for.\" — Robert Kiyosaki \nIf you're a millionaire by the time you're 30 but blow it all by age 40, you've gained nothing. Grow and protect your investment portfolio by carefully diversifying it, and you may find yourself funding many generations to come.1 \n19. \"Know what you own, and know why you own it.\" — Peter Lynch \nDo your homework before making a decision. Once you've made a decision, make sure to re-evaluate your portfolio on a timely basis. A wise holding today may not be a wise holding in the future.14 \n20. \"Financial peace isn't the acquisition of stuff. It's learning to live on less than you make, so you can give money back and have money to invest. You can't win until you do this.\" — Dave Ramsey \nBy being modest in your spending, you can ensure you will have enough for retirement and can give back to the community as well.1 \n21. \"Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas.\" — Paul Samuelson \nIf you think investing is gambling, you're doing it wrong. The work involved requires planning and patience. However, the gains you see over time are indeed exciting.1 \nMany of the best quotes about investing urge thoughtfulness over impulsiveness, boldness instead of caution, and smart research over flavor-of-the-month decision-making.\nTop Investing Quotes from Contrarians \n22. \"The four most dangerous words in investing are, it’s different this time.\" — Sir John Templeton \nFollow market trends and history. Don't speculate that this particular time will be any different. For example, a major key to investing in a specific stock or bond fund is its performance over five years.15 \n23. \"Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.\" — Warren Buffett \nIn the beginning, diversification is relevant. However, there are dangers of over-diversifying your portfolio. Once you've gotten your feet wet and have confidence in your investments, you can adjust your portfolio accordingly and make bigger bets.16 \n24. \"You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready, you won't do well in the markets.\" — Peter Lynch \nWhen hit with recessions or declines, you must stay the course. Economies are cyclical, and the markets have shown that they will recover. Make sure you are a part of those recoveries.17 \n25. \"The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.\" — Peter Thiel18 \nHow Much Should I Invest As a Beginner?\nAs a beginner, it's usually recommended to start investing with an amount you feel comfortable risking. Many experts suggest a percentage of your income, such as 10% to 15%. It can even be less. Starting small allows you to get accustomed to market fluctuations and see how your investment choices perform without too much financial pressure. It's also helpful to consider low-cost, diversified options like index funds or ETFs, as these reduce the risk of putting all your money into one stock.\nWhat's the Best Way to Diversify My Investment Portfolio?\nDiversifying your portfolio involves spreading your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and regions. This approach minimizes risk because different investments often perform differently in response to market events. For instance, you could allocate funds into stocks, bonds, real estate, and high-yield savings. Within stocks, consider a mix of industries (e.g., healthcare, consumer goods), and geographic markets. Low-cost index funds or ETFs are also effective for achieving broad diversification with minimal effort.\nWhy Is Investing in the Stock Market Better Than Keeping Money in a Savings Account?\nWhile a savings account is safe and provides liquidity, it offers lower returns, often below inflation rates. In contrast, the stock market historically provides long-term returns, allowing your money to grow more substantially over time. Stocks, although riskier, provide opportunities for compounding returns, meaning your money has the potential to generate more wealth over the years. For goals like retirement or major life expenses, stock investments are usually better suited than savings alone.\nThe Bottom Line \nThe world of investing can be cold and hard. Refer back to these quotes when you're feeling shaky or confused about investing. How are they relevant to your experience? Do you have any favorite quotes to add? Is there something you're overlooking that you could be doing differently? Whenever everything seems too tough, remember the words of Colin Powell, \"A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work.\"19",

  "text": "Best Ways to Earn Passive Income in 2024\nThe best ways to earn passive income aren’t only the purview of the wealthy. With a modicum of startup time and capital, anyone can create a passive income stream. Whether you have a full-time job or are a retiree seeking extra cash, passive income ideas are available to increase your cash flow. Passive income isn’t literally money without effort, but more akin to money with less effort. Some passive income strategies, like owning dividend-paying stocks or bonds, require less work than owning rental real estate. This guide covers how to get started, how much passive income you can earn, the required effort, and various passive income investments. \nBest Ways to Make Passive Income in 2024 \n15 Passive Income Ideas: \nDividend stocks\nDividend exchange-traded funds\nBonds\nBond exchange-traded funds\nCertificates of deposit\nHigh-yield savings accounts\nMoney market funds\nREIT investing\nPeer-to-peer lending\nReal estate crowdfunding\nReal estate debt investing\nAffiliate marketing\nDigital product sales\nPlacing ads on your car\nDrop shipping\nHow to Generate Passive Income \nThere are scores of passive income sources and ways to start earning passive income. Before you begin, you’ll need to figure out how much effort and money you want to expend. Then choose a passive income idea that fits your capital, skills, and interests. \nStep 1: Choose passive income streams. Decide whether you want to invest for passive income or run a side gig that generates some cash. Either way, it typically takes some time to build up a decent cash flow. \nStep 2: Choose the platform that fits your needs. If you’re seeking passive investment income, there are many financial brokerage firms, mobile investment apps, and banks that will suffice. However, there are other measures you can consider. For instance, you can learn how to make passive income online by selling products and services. With a social media account like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, or a website, you can market products and services quite effectively. These are among the best ways to earn passive income, and the required effort is greater in the beginning and diminishes as time passes. \nStep 3: Set your expectations. Earning passive income from investing involves predicting your return based upon the investment amount. A $5,000 investment in a dividend fund that pays a 6% yield will provide $300 per year, while successful affiliate websites might earn $1,000 per month or more. \nCompare Top Investment Platforms \nBest Passive Income Investments \nThe best passive income opportunities often involve balancing human capital, financial capital, and time. Investing in financial markets involves banking and financial products like stocks and bonds. Buying banking products like certificates of deposit and high-yield cash accounts is less risky, but has lower upside potential than investing in financial market assets. \nPassive investing in dividend-paying stocks or interest-paying bonds provides cash flow but requires a larger investment to realize meaningful monthly income. Crowdfunding investment apps also enable the public to buy shares in farmland, large and small real estate projects, wine, art, and more to receive ongoing cash flow. \nThere is a range of risk levels when investing in financial assets. The lowest-risk cash flow-producing assets are money market mutual funds, high-yield savings accounts, and bank certificates of deposit. Investing in dividend-paying stocks or stock funds carries the risk that the dividend will be cut and also that the principal value of the investment might fall. Interest-paying bonds and bond funds will vary in price as well, but the interest payments are rarely cut. Individual bonds, held until maturity, will return the par or full value of the investment. But bonds sold before maturity and bond funds might be sold for less, or more, than your original payment amount. \nCrowdfunding apps that invest in real estate, farmland, startups, art, wine, and more carry additional risks. Many require long lockup periods before you can withdraw your money. Others are not as closely regulated as traditional financial assets. With newer platforms, there is a greater chance of asset defaults and business closures. \nDividend Stocks \nBuying dividend-paying stocks is a path to owning a portion of a publicly traded company. Many stocks pay a portion of their earnings to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, which are usually paid quarterly. You have the option to reinvest the cash payment in additional shares of stock or to take the cash dividend payment. \nLong-term investors who build up a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks or funds have one of the best ways to earn passive income. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is a passive income idea with both cash flow and capital growth potential. \nDividend Exchange-Traded Funds \nA dividend exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that owns many dividend-paying stocks. You can buy one investment, such as the SPDR S&P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV), and receive access to a portfolio of dividend-paying companies. The WDIV ETF owns global companies that frequently pay higher dividends than U.S. firms. Many dividend ETFs also screen for companies with a history of increasing dividends. \nThe dividend ETF is another passive income investment that provides regular cash payments along with an added bonus of capital appreciation potential. Consider management fees when choosing a dividend exchange-traded fund, as higher fund fees can detract from returns. \nBest Online Brokers for ETFs \nBonds \nBonds are back in favor as interest rates are higher than they’ve been in decades. Unlike stocks, bond investments are loans that you make to a company or government entity. In exchange for the loan, you receive regular coupon interest payments. \nBonds are among the best ways to earn passive income because if you buy a newly issued bond at par, usually $1,000, and hold it until maturity, you’ll receive regular cash interest payments and a return of principal at the bond's maturity. Bonds with lower credit ratings typically provide higher interest payments and greater cash flow, while government bonds and highly rated corporate bonds will offer lower interest payments. \nBond values can rise and fall, so you might receive more or less than your initial price, should you sell before maturity. The bond’s credit rating suggests the bond’s likelihood of default, with lower-rated bonds carrying a higher risk of default. Investors can also invest in diversified bond mutual or exchange-traded funds to build passive income without lifting a finger. \nBond ETFs \nBundle together a group of individual bonds, and you have a bond fund. With differing bond maturities and investment styles, there are multiple ways to generate passive income with bond funds. Those comfortable with a risky asset can purchase a high-yield bond fund like the SPDR Blmbg ST HY Bd ETF (SJNK), which has a current 7.73% SEC yield.1 \nMore conservative investors can buy a diversified government bond fund and receive regular interest payments that are exempt from state and local taxes. Unlike buying an individual bond, both the coupon or interest payment and the fund value will vary. \nCertificates of Deposit \nCertificates of deposit (CDs) are banking products that you can buy at most financial institutions. You invest a specific amount of money, typically $100 or more, and leave the money invested for a period of time. CDs typically pay a pre-specified interest rate and are usually issued for terms from three months to five years or more. \nThere are a variety of CD types, including fixed and floating variable interest rates. Investors seeking regular cash flow and a stable principal value can create a CD ladder and buy CDs at regular intervals. As one CD comes due, you reinvest the proceeds in a new certificate of deposit. Ladders are among the best passive income investments to increase cash flow when you expect interest rates to rise. \nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts \nA bank high-yield savings account pays higher interest payments than a typical savings account. The required minimum balance can be greater than that of a savings account. \nIf you’re wondering how to make passive income, a high-yield savings account is a good choice. For passive income from money that you need for near-term expenses and emergencies, a high-yield savings account is a sound choice and keeps your funds liquid. \nThe process of opening a high-yield savings account is similar to opening a traditional bank account. Simply click on the “open an account” button on your preferred bank’s website and answer several personal questions, such as address, Social Security number, and type of account. To verify your identity, you might need to supply prior addresses, debts, and employment details. \nMoney Market Accounts \nA money market mutual fund is an investment vehicle that owns short-term commercial debt. This investment is distinct from a money market bank account, which is similar to a high-yield bank savings account. Like a typical mutual fund, money from many investors is pooled to invest in short-term debt and cash-equivalent instruments. The allure of these accounts is that the share value is pegged at one dollar, and yields are among the highest of the high-yield cash equivalent group. \nYou’ll need to invest in a money market fund within an investment brokerage account. These investments are liquid, and the money can be withdrawn within a few days. The interest from money market funds can be withdrawn for cash flow or reinvested to grow for the future. \nCompare Providers \nAlternative Passive Income Ideas \nYou’ll find a laundry list of alternatives to stock, bond, and cash passive income ideas. Some of these choices are more passive than others. Real estate investing is frequently touted as a response to the question, “What is the best way to earn passive income?” But real estate investing takes many forms, and requires varying amounts of effort. \nOwning and managing real property requires a chunk of capital and is a passive endeavor until a pipe breaks or the renter doesn’t pay their rent. Then it is a lot of work. Real estate crowdfunding apps or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) are more passive. Once you purchase the securities, you wait for the cash flow. \nAnother popular way to earn passive income online is by creating an affiliate website, but this involves more work than meets the eye. An Airbnb rental is only semi-passive if you hire a team to manage the property. Cash-back credit cards and shopping sites might be considered a passive income idea, yet you’re spending in order to receive the cash. That’s not a net-positive endeavor. \nOther alternatives to passive income involve digital property sales, like e-books, courses, apps, and other online goods. For all of these passive income ideas, there is a hefty startup time commitment and some upfront cash as well. You’re also less certain of receiving a return on your investment if the sales miss expectations. Evaluate these alternatives to passive income to learn whether there's a strategy for you. \nREIT Investing \nA real estate investment trust or REIT is an investment vehicle that owns a pool of commercial real estate. There are REITs that provide broad diversification across the real estate landscape. Or you can buy niche REITs that own senior housing, student housing, warehouses, commercial property, mortgages, shopping malls, data centers or many other varieties of property. The benefit of REITs for cash flow is that they are required by law to pay out 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.2 \nPeer-to-Peer Lending \nDebt investing is popular, with many platforms that enable everyday investors to be the bank and lend money to others. Peer-to-peer lending offers various types of loans for various reasons. Platforms match borrowers with lenders for various cash needs. \nThese peer-to-peer lending apps offer higher interest payments than other traditional stock, bond, or cash vehicles. But they are riskier as potential loan payment defaults can eat into your returns. To minimize that risk, you can choose to invest in higher-quality loans and diversify by owning many loans. \nReal Estate Crowdfunding \nReal estate crowdfunding allows investors to finance real estate projects through online platforms with the goal of profiting either from capital appreciation or passive income. There are a range of real estate crowdfunding websites offering small to large investors an entry into commercial, industrial, single-family, and apartment building investing. \nFundrise is our 2024 best real estate crowdfunding website. It provides investment access to real estate and startup venture capital funding with only a $10 minimum. \nReal estate crowdfunding can deliver a higher interest rate than REITs, but it has less liquidity, less government oversight, and a greater risk of default. \nReal Estate Debt or Note Investing \nReal estate debt or note investing puts you in a banker's seat. You lend money to those seeking to buy new real estate, remodel existing property, fix and flip, and a variety of other types of real estate investors. \nApps like Groundfloor provide investors the opportunity to lend to real estate buyers. The allure of lending to real estate borrowers is that your investment is secured by real property. Some of the larger real estate crowdfunding apps also deliver real estate note investing. \nA drawback to real estate note investing also makes it one of the best investments for passive income. Unlike publicly traded securities, you can’t immediately redeem your shares, but may need to wait several months or more for a return of your principal investment. The lack of liquidity can also lead to higher investment returns. \nAffiliate Marketing \nAffiliate marketers sell products and services on their websites or social media accounts and receive a commission from the brand for the sale. Affiliate marketers frequently write reviews to draw visitors to their websites. The setup for affiliate marketing is not passive and involves creating a website or social media platform, developing contracts with companies who pay affiliates, and creating content to draw visitors to the website. \nThe passive aspect of affiliate marketing is that once the content is written and a website develops a stream of visitors, your work is diminished. That’s only partially true, as you’ll need to write new content and update old content in order to maintain and increase website traffic. Additionally, it can take months or more to begin to generate cash flow. We place affiliate marketing on the higher-effort step of the passive income ideas ladder. \nDigital Product Sales \nCreating digital products or content, such as online courses, is among the best ways to earn passive income online. Similar to affiliate marketing, you’ll sell your digital products online through a variety of outlets, such as an Etsy store, social media platform, YouTube, or a website. \nAlign your digital products with your area of expertise. Sample types of digital products include printouts, e-courses, e-books, webinars, and more. This is not the best passive income idea for beginners with limited free time. Making passive income with digital product sales initially requires market analysis, product creation, and marketing before realizing decent passive income flow. \nAdvertise on Your Car \nDrivers with cars can get paid to wrap their cars in advertisement banners. We found firms that paid from $100 to $500 per month just for driving with an advertisement on their car. For anyone wondering, “What is the simplest way to make passive income?” Car wrapping is not without its limitations. \nCar wrapping scams exist and, unfortunately, are abundant in the industry. Don’t pay money upfront for access to advertise with car wrapping. You’ll also need to accept the advertiser's stipulations of mileage, and other factors. Finally, making passive income by advertising on your car means that you need to drive around with an ad on your car. To put this in perspective, the ad can be simply placed on the door or hood of your car, or it can be wrapped around the entire vehicle. Make sure you understand what’s needed before signing a binding contract. \nCreate an Online Store with Drop Shipping \nCreating an online store with drop shipping can answer the question, “How can I passively make $1,000 a month?” After setting up your product inventory, payment system, and marketing strategy, drop shipping is among the simplest ways to make money online. Select products from manufacturers or wholesalers and sell them as your own inventory. The supplier handles the inventory and shipping, so you can grow your brand and market the shop. \nLike most passive online income strategies, after setting up the business, you’ll need to devote a lot of time to marketing. You can market your store through a website and/or social media. Once you’re up and running, with brand recognition and customers, maintaining an online store with drop shipping is a good form of passive income. \nBest Alternative Investing Platforms \nFactors to Consider When Choosing Passive Income Streams \nCapital \nAll passive income ideas require startup capital. To develop a meaningful passive income stream from financial assets like cash equivalents, stocks, and bonds, you’ll need a decent account balance. With $100,000, an investment paying a 5% dividend or interest payment provides $5,000 per year cash flow. \nAlthough affiliate marketing requires a small cash outlay to potentially obtain cash flow, you’ll pay more with your human capital or time. \nRisk \nAll investments carry a degree of risk. Certificates of deposit and high-yield cash investments don’t risk the principal value of your investment, but they could lose purchasing power over time due to inflation. Investing in higher-risk dividend-paying financial assets involves the potential to lose principal and decrease cash flow should dividends be cut. Crowdfunding passive income investments are less regulated and can tie up your money for longer periods with added risks of defaults and platform failures. \nTaxes \nWith the exception of tax-exempt municipal bonds from your state of residence, all income is taxed by the government. After-tax income is what really matters, so understand how your investment is taxed, and your specific marginal tax bracket. Dividends and interest payments may have their own tax rates. \nKey Differences Between Stocks and Alternative Investments \nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) \nWhat Is Passive Income?\nPassive income is money that you earn without much effort. In contrast with earned income, from a job, passive income flows after an initial startup effort and cost to create long-term cash flow. Passive income ideas span low-effort activities such as buying a high dividend bond fund to creating online businesses that require an initial startup effort which becomes less labor-intensive over time.\nWhat’s the Difference Between Active Income and Passive Income?\nThere is a fine line between active and passive income. Clearly, going to work every day in exchange for a regular paycheck is active income. Task work such as food delivery, rideshare driving, freelance jobs, consulting, and contract work are also ways to create active income. With active income, you get paid for working. Passive income ideas span a range of jobs that require less effort than active income. \nReceiving income in exchange for zero effort is unlikely unless you count receiving an inheritance or winning the lottery. Writing a book and then receiving royalties is a great example of passive income, yet with the passage of time, book royalties will decline. In contrast, if you buy a dividend-paying stock fund, once you select the investment, you will receive ongoing dividend payments without much additional effort. \nSome passive income ideas are liquid, like buying dividend-paying investments, while others are less liquid, like long-term real estate syndications. Some passive income jobs require minor ongoing work in exchange for cash flow, while others are less passive and involve greater ongoing effort. Passive income strategies range from those with a small startup effort, like investing in dividend-paying stock or money market mutual funds, to more labor-intensive ones, such as managing rental properties or creating an affiliate marketing review website.\nHow Can You Make Passive Income With Little to No Money?\nBy creating digital products like courses, apps, e-books, and more and selling them, you can create passive income with minimal cash. Books can be sold on digital marketplaces like Amazon, while you can sell other products through your social media accounts or an online store. While you don’t need a lot of cash to create digital products, you need time and effort to market and sell them.\nIf you have a job with a 401(k) or other retirement account, you can contribute part of your paycheck to that account and invest in financial assets. At retirement, you’ll have enough money to create a passive income stream.\nCan You Live Off of Passive Income?\nYes, you can live off of passive income. It’s easiest to live off of passive income if you live in an area with a low cost of living. To live off of financial investment and cash-equivalent income, you’ll need a larger amount of money. To earn $30,000 per year, you’ll need $600,000 invested at 5% per year. \nTo live off of digital product or service sales, you’ll need to earn several thousand dollars per month. The same goes for affiliate marketing. \nOlder individuals who have built up a large amount of investable assets are most likely to be able to live off of passive income. The exceptions are those who’ve made a lot of money early in life, live simply, and invest for income and capital growth.\nHow Do You Pick the Right Passive Income Idea?\nTo pick the right passive income idea, assess your available time, risk tolerance level, and available capital. Also, explore your skill sets to determine which passive income ideas are a good fit for you. The easiest way to start investing for future passive income is to start small and automate your investing.\nWho Should Consider Passive Income Streams?\nEveryone should consider investing for the future. When you are older, it’s easier to create a passive income stream with investing. Younger individuals with ambition and the ability to motivate themselves are wise to consider creating passive income streams through online stores and creating digital products. Employment is uncertain, and creating multiple streams of income is a sound financial plan.\nIs Passive Income Taxable?\nYes, all income is taxable. Earned income is taxed at the federal, state, and local level. You’ll also pay self-employment tax with earned self-employment income. Investment income has its own tax considerations. While real estate can be taxed in various ways.\nTo understand how passive income is taxed, it’s wise to visit the IRS website for more details. Online tax software programs such as Turbo Tax can help you estimate the tax you’ll pay on passive income. \nDoes Passive Income Affect Social Security Benefits?\nWhile passive income won’t impact the amount of your Social Security benefit, it can affect the amount of tax you’re required to pay. Up to 85% of your Social Security benefits can be taxed. Like all IRS regulations, there is a list of criteria to determine the impact of your passive income on the taxation of your Social Security benefits.3 \nVisit the SSA.gov website to understand how your passive income could impact the taxation of your Social Security benefits.\nHow to Make Passive Income as a Teenager\nTeenagers have many money-making ideas available to them. Unless you have access to a large sum of money, earning passive income through investing in dividend-paying assets is unlikely. Creating an online business as a teenager is a potential path to future passive income. Starting an online store, selling digital products, creating an e-course, or writing product reviews are all paths to ultimately making passive income as a teenager. \nTeenagers can promote their businesses online through a website and/or social media accounts. These beginner passive income ideas require substantial startup effort and a modicum of long-term maintenance.",

  "text": "What Is Wall Street? Role in Investing and Why It's Famous\nWhat Is Wall Street? \nWall Street is literally a street located in New York City at the southern end of Manhattan. Figuratively, Wall Street is much more. It's synonymous with the financial industry and the firms within it. This connotation has its roots in the fact that so many brokerages and investment banks historically have established their headquarters in and around the street. All the better to be close to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). \nBeing on or near Wall Street is no longer considered essential for financial institutions. In fact, these days they are located all around the country. However, the term \"Wall Street\" still means business—the investment business—and the interests, motivations, and attitudes of its players. \nKey Takeaways\nWall Street is a street located in the lower Manhattan section of New York City.\nWall Street is used as an umbrella term to describe the financial markets and the companies that trade publicly on exchanges throughout the U.S.\nHistorically, Wall Street has been the location of some of the largest U.S. brokerages and investment banking firms, and is also the home of the NYSE.\nWall Street is often contrasted with Main Street, the latter of which is a metaphor for small businesses and individual investors.\nEvents that happened on or around Wall Street often have impacted not just the investment industry, but the U.S. (and even the global) economy.\nUnderstanding Wall Street \nWall Street and its surrounding southern Manhattan neighborhood—known to locals as the Financial District—remain an important location where a number of financial institutions are based. The financial district is iconic with the bronze Arturo Di Modica statue of the Charging Bull. However, the globalization and digitization of finance and investing have led to the rise of many U.S. broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, and investment companies located elsewhere. \nStill, Wall Street remains a collective name for the financial markets, the companies that trade publicly, and the investment community itself. Stock exchanges, investment banking firms, commercial banks, brokerages and broker-dealers, financial services, and underwriting firms all symbolize Wall Street. \nIt's a globally recognized expression that, to some extent, ever refers to the U.S. financial system. Both the NYSE (the largest equities-based exchange in the world) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—arguably the most important regional bank of the Federal Reserve System—are based in the Wall Street area. \nWall Street is often shortened to \"the Street,\" which is how the term is frequently used by those in financial circles and the media. For example, when reporting a company's earnings, an analyst might compare a company's revenues to what the Street was expecting. In this case, the analyst is comparing the company's earnings to what financial analysts and investment firms were expecting for that period. \nThe Importance of Wall Street \nWall Street has had an important impact both economically and culturally. \nEconomic Importance \nThe U.S. is the largest economy in the world and New York City is its financial center. As such, Wall Street's global importance is unparalleled. \nWall Street consists of some of the largest financial institutions in the world and employs hundreds of thousands of people. It's home to the NYSE and Nasdaq stock exchanges, two of the largest stock exchanges in the world. On these exchanges are listed some of the biggest companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple, and Exxon. \nThe economic importance of Wall Street extends throughout the American and international economies, as many financial firms do business worldwide, extend loans to a variety of businesses and individuals, and finance large-scale, global projects. \nCultural Importance \nWall Street's cultural influence extends to movies, TV shows, books, and more. Films such as Wall Street, Margin Call, Boiler Room, Barbarians at the Gate, and more from previous decades, highlight what the fast-paced life is like on Wall Street. They display an exciting, wealthy, and interesting lifestyle. \nLarge players on Wall Street have become celebrity icons. Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, Carl Icahn, Bernie Madoff, George Soros, and Larry Fink are names familiar to many. In the imaginations of some in contemporary society, the term Wall Street may evoke a sense of power, the elite, and often, unscrupulous behavior. \nDuring times of economic trouble, such as the financial crisis of 2008, Wall Street sometimes becomes a scapegoat and the ills of the economy are blamed on the assumed greed associated with it. No other financial term has become so woven into the global culture.\nHistory of Wall Street \nWall Street got its name from the wooden wall Dutch colonists built in lower Manhattan in 1653 to defend themselves from the British and Native Americans. The wall was taken down in 1699, but the name stuck.1 \nGiven its proximity to New York's ports, the Wall Street area became a bustling center of trade in the 1700s. Its origins as a financial center began in 1792, when 24 of the most prominent brokers and merchants in the U.S. signed the Buttonwood Agreement. They reportedly gathered on Wall Street, under a buttonwood tree, to do business.21 \nThe agreement outlined the common commission-based form of trading securities. In effect, it was an effort to establish a members-only stock exchange. Some of the first securities traded were war bonds and the stocks of such institutions as the Bank of New York.32 \nOut of this acorn of an agreement, the oak that became the NYSE grew. In 1817, the Buttonwood brokers renamed themselves The New York Stock and Exchange Board. The organization rented out spaces for trading in several locations until 1865, when it settled on a location of its own, at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets.1 \n18 Broad Street\nThe location of the beating heart of Wall Street, the NYSE, is a 1903 Neo-Classical structure of white marble. An adjacent annex, constructed in 1922, is located at 11 Wall Street, and another subsidiary building is at 20 Broad Street. These three buildings fill the block bounded by Wall Street on the north, Broad Street on the East, Exchange Place on the south, and New Street on the west.4\nAs the U.S. grew, several other major exchanges established headquarters in the Wall Street area. These included the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Board of Trade, the New York Futures Exchange (NYFE), and the American Stock Exchange, now known as the NYSE American Options. \nTo support the exchanges and to be where the action was, banks, brokerage firms, and financiers clustered offices around Wall Street. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the House of Morgan, officially J.P. Morgan & Co.—the forerunner to JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley—was directly opposite the NYSE, at 23 Wall Street. \nAfter World War I, New York City surpassed London to become the world's largest and most significant financial center. \nWall Street vs. Main Street \nWall Street is often compared and contrasted to Main Street. The term \"Main Street\" is used as a metaphor for individual investors, small businesses, employees, and the overall economy. It's derived from the common name for the principal street of a town where most of the local businesses are located. \nThere is often a perceived conflict between the goals, desires, and motivations of Main Street and Wall Street. Wall Street tends to represent big businesses and financial institutions, while Main Street represents mom-and-pop shops, small companies, and individuals. \nKey Events on Wall Street \nEvents that happened on or around Wall Street often have impacted not just the investment industry, but the global economy and society. Here are some significant moments in Wall Street history. \n1889: The Wall Street Journal \nOn July 8, 1889, Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser launched The Wall Street Journal, a four-page afternoon newspaper devoted to objective financial and business news. The three men were reporters, but Dow was also a numbers-cruncher who came up with the idea of creating a benchmark list of companies and their stock prices to represent the entire stock market.5 \nSoon, the Journal was publishing the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index along with hundreds of prices of company stocks, bonds, and futures, and the average prime rate for bank loans. For nearly a century, before the advent of real-time internet listings, the Journal was the paper of record for the financial markets. \nIt evolved into a six-day-a-week periodical (that's been online since 1996). The Journal is a leading and well-respected source of financial and business journalism. \nThe three founders operated out of offices in lower Manhattan. The fact that they chose to name their new publication The Wall Street Journal indicates that Wall Street already was something of an umbrella term for the world of finance and its denizens. Over the years, the paper helped fix this meaning in the public's mind. \n1920: The Wall Street Bombing \nIt was around noon on Sept. 16, 1920. A horse-drawn cart pulled up at 23 Wall Street right in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co. A bustling corner of the neighborhood, it was especially crowded with those headed out for lunch. The cart suddenly exploded. It had been packed with dynamite and filled with sash weights that sailed through the air.6 \nAt that time, it was the worst domestic bombing in U.S. history. Ultimately, 40 people were killed or died from their injuries, and another 300 were injured. The J.P. Morgan building's interior was gutted. Marks from the shrapnel still are visible on the exterior.7 \nNo one claimed credit and the case was never solved. But because the explosion occurred in front of the Morgan building, known as a symbol of American capitalism, the bombing was ultimately decided to have been an act of terrorism performed by “Reds”—anarchists and communist sympathizers. A stack of anarchist flyers found in a mailbox a block away from Wall Street supported this theory.7 \nAs a result, the authorities arrested hundreds of suspected Reds and deported those of foreign nationality. The bombing also encouraged the nativist sentiments that developed in the U.S. during the 1920s, which led to tighter restrictions on immigration.7 \n1929: The Stock Market Crash \nThe stock market crash of 1929 remains the worst financial crisis in U.S. history. In a pre-digital trading era, its epicenter was the NYSE. \nThe crash began on October 24 when, after nearly a decade of unparalleled, uninterrupted growth, the stock market opened lower than the previous session. Equities' prices continued to drop throughout the day and, as the news spread, crowds began to gather outside the Exchange.8 \nThey groaned as the market closed down again that day, cheered brokers during the next two days when the market seemed to rally, and then panicked on October 28 and October 29, when the declines resumed. Inside the stock exchange, the scene was sheer pandemonium as prices fell too fast for ticker tapes and blackboards to record them.8 \nUltimately, the DJIA was to fall 89% from its September 1929 peak, wiping out both corporate and individual wealth.8 \nThe crash ushered in the Great Depression. A quarter of America’s working population lost their jobs as the U.S. economy went into a tailspin. Economies throughout Europe followed suit. In the end, the stock market crash and the ensuing decade-long depression directly impacted nearly every segment of society and altered an entire generation's perspective of, and relationship to, the financial markets.9 \n1987: The Black Monday Crash \nOn what is known as Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 25% in value, leading exchanges around the world to drop in a similar frenzy. The week prior, indices had fallen an approximate 10%, priming the pump for the ensuing panic. Up until that time, a bull market had been in control since 1982. \nThanks to the actions of chairman Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, a seeming disaster on a global scale was averted. But the crash brought to light the potential for disruption that the then-new technique of computer programs instigating large-scale amounts of trading might cause (even though enormous amounts of trading were handled by humans that day, as well). \nThe exact cause of this short-term crash has never been pinpointed. However, afterwards, exchanges implemented circuit breaker rules to prevent program trading from spurring runaway selling. It was hoped that this and other trading curbs would allow the markets time to stabilize and give regulators (and investors) the chance to take appropriate steps. \n2007-2008: The Global Financial Crisis \nThe global financial crisis of 2007-2008 resulted from years of deregulation, easy credit, predatory mortgage lending, the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, and the unregulated use of derivatives. It led to the Great Recession. The root cause of the crisis was unethical and exploitative behavior by banks, investment banks, and insurance firms. \nBorrowers with unsatisfactory credit were given mortgage loans without concern for their ability to pay them off and without their comprehension of the risks involved with the loans. As rates rose, those borrowers' mortgage rates reset higher and they couldn't afford to make monthly payments. What's more, as home prices fell dramatically, homeowners couldn't sell their houses for enough to cover their loans. This caused massive numbers of defaults. \nRisky derivative securities had been created with the subprime mortgage loans sold by banks. In addition, banks and other large investors used customer deposits to invest in these derivatives. With the defaults on home loans, the derivatives plunged in value. \nMany financial institutions had ties to the loans, derivatives, and credit default swaps, an insurance product that investors in the derivatives bought to protect against the risk of default. Thus, they found themselves in severe trouble after the housing market bubble burst. \nFrom housing industry crash to a U.S. financial industry on the brink of collapse to the near ruin of other financial systems across the globe. It was the worst financial crisis since the stock market crash of 1929. \nThe U.S. government had no choice but to bail out financial institutions that had always been considered “too big to fail.”\n2011: Occupy Wall Street \nOccupy Wall Street was a 2011 protest movement against social and economic inequality that was centered in Zuccotti Park, located in Manhattan's Financial District. It began on September 17, as hundreds of protesters camped out in the park. The police forcibly removed and arrested them two months later, on November 15. During the intervening period, there were marches and speeches, calling for more balanced income distribution, better-paying jobs, bank reform, and less corporate influence in politics. \"We are the 99%,\" was the Occupy protestors' slogan. \nThe Regulation of Wall Street \nAfter the 1929 Crash \nRegulatory measures were put into place to address the lack of government oversight that was considered to have led to the crisis that began in 1929. Among other things, the Securities Act of 1933 required financial institutions to provide investors with all significant information about securities being offered for sale. It also prohibited fraud in securities sales. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and gave it significant power over the securities industry. This included the authority to regulate brokerage firms and to require financial reporting by publicly traded companies. \nAfter the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). It created new government agencies with financial system oversight. The idea behind the act was to address the risky behaviors of financial institutions and the dearth of regulatory oversight that led to the crisis. One area of grave concern was the predatory mortgage lending that had occurred. Another focus was the stability of financial institutions. The act made it possible to liquidate or restructure firms, if necessary, to prevent the use of taxpayer funds to keep them afloat. \nThe act's Volker Rule restricted the investing practices of banks and regulated derivative securities. It also set up the SEC Office of Credit Ratings to ensure that credit agencies henceforth issued appropriate ratings for institutions, rather than the fabricated favorable ratings that were part of the lead-up to the crisis. \nDuring the Trump Administration \nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act signed in 2018 by President Trump addressed criticisms of Dodd-Frank and rolled back some of its provisions. Among other things, it exempted banks with assets of less than $10 billion from the Volker Rule requirements, gave consumers the ability to freeze their credit files at no cost, and eased capital requirements for banks that didn't offer lending or traditional banking services. \nWhat Does Wall Street Speculation Mean?\nSpeculation refers to the act of investing in securities that have a high risk-reward profile with the goal of obtaining substantial gains, despite the risk of substantial losses. An investor who speculates is likely focused on price fluctuations. They may believe that the market has inaccurately priced a security and they're trying to capitalize on that disparity. Wall Street speculators tend to be professional traders as opposed to retail investors who buy and hold stocks or other assets for the long term.\nWhat Time Does Wall Street Open and Close?\nThe major U.S. stock markets, including the NYSE and the Nasdaq, are normally open 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday. However, there are also extended-hour sessions earlier and later.\nPre-market trading typically occurs between 8:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., though it can begin as early as 4 a.m. EST.\nAfter-hours trading starts at 4 p.m. and can run as late as 8 p.m. EST.\nWhat Is Black Wall Street?\nBlack Wall Street was a nickname given to the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, one of the largest and most prosperous African-American business communities in the U.S. in the early 20th century. From May to June, 1921, its 35 blocks were destroyed during the Tulsa Race Riot. It was quickly rebuilt, with over 80 businesses reopening by 1922. More generally, Black Wall Street can also refer to any area of African-American high economic or financial activity.1011\nHow Do You Get a Job on Wall Street?\nGetting a job on Wall Street often starts in college. Majors like finance, business administration and management, economics, accounting, and mathematics are natural fits for the investment industry. Firms will consider degrees in other areas too, like marketing or engineering. Try to get an internship at a Wall Street firm or similar institution for at least one summer. A Master of Business Administration (MBA) can also be attractive to financial institutions, as can tech industry experience. It's also important to target what type of Wall Street job you'd be best suited for. They break down into three main areas:\nInvestment Team: research analysts, portfolio managers, and traders\nOperations: client relationship, marketing, risk assessment, legal, back-office functions\nSales: those involved in the creation, promotion, and sale of stocks, bonds, IPOs, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments\nThe Bottom Line \nWall Street is both an actual street and a symbol. It's home to a variety of financial and investment firms, along with institutions like the NYSE and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Globally, it's come to connote the U.S. financial and investment communities and industries, plus its interests, attitudes, and behavior.",

  "text": "How Information Bias Can Lead to Poor Investing Decisions\nWhat Is Information Bias? \nInformation bias occurs when information or data obtained by someone is measured or recorded incorrectly such that it no longer accurately reflects the underlying truth. This bias can be the result of a simple error in data collection or information processing, be caused by deliberate distortion, or arise from a subconscious tendency to filter information to meet one’s needs or conform to preexisting beliefs.1 \nInformation bias can significantly affect an investor’s decision making, leading to anywhere from less-than-ideal to dangerous investment choices. This is because human beings are naturally predisposed toward confirmation bias (when we seek out and prioritize information that fits our preconceived notions while dismissing contradictory evidence) and recency bias (when newer, more salient information is given more weight than it might really have), among others. \nIn today’s age of social media and constant connectivity, it is more important than ever to be aware of the types of information we receive and how they can help or hinder investment decisions and financial outcomes. \nKey Takeaways\nInformation bias occurs when data or other information is distorted or biased in some way so that it no longer reflects actual reality.\nConfirmation bias and availability (or recency) bias are two common examples of information bias that can impact financial investors.\nThese and other information biases can lead to poor investment decisions based on irrelevant or excessive information.\nSocial media and the internet have increased the risk of information bias in personal finance and investing.\nUnderstanding and avoiding information bias can lead to better, more objective investment decisions.\nInformation Bias and Investing \nInformation bias can lead investors to make bad decisions based on faulty data, or to seek out and rely on irrelevant or excessive information when choosing among market moves. The proliferation of social media has made it easier than ever to access vast amounts of information from all sorts of sources, making information bias a critical issue. \nInformation bias can negatively affect an investor’s decision making; for example, someone may place undue importance on a single news article or tweet, ignoring the broader context of a company’s performance or the market as a whole. Or an investor may seek out information that confirms already-held beliefs about a company or the broader market and ignore or downplay contradictory evidence. \nSome types of information used by investors may not be as relevant to trading decisions as they might seem. For instance, day-to-day fluctuations in stock prices are often influenced by external factors such as broad market sentiment, which may not necessarily reflect a specific company’s long-term prospects. \nSimilarly, a company’s past performance may not be a reliable indicator of its future performance, as business environments and circumstances change and evolve over time. \nResearch has shown that investors who focus on relevant information and avoid information bias can make better investment decisions. For example, a study by behavioral economists Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean found that individual investors who traded less frequently and paid less attention to stock market news achieved better returns than those who traded more frequently and paid more attention to the news.2 \nThree Common Information Biases \nRecency bias, also known as availability bias, is a cognitive error identified in behavioral economics in which people incorrectly believe that recent events will occur again soon. By weighting recent information more, they also discount relevant information that is older or harder to obtain.3\nConfirmation bias is the tendency of human beings to actively search for, interpret, and retain information that matches their preconceived notions and beliefs. At the same time, information that goes against these beliefs is discounted or ignored entirely.4\nAsymmetric information occurs when one party to a transaction has more or better information than the other. For example, used-car sellers typically know more about the car than the buyer, or insurance policy applicants know more about their health than insurers. Asymmetric information can, in some cases, lead to market failure.5\nHow to Avoid Information Bias in Investing \nTo avoid information bias in investing, consider the following tips and strategies: \nLimit exposure to financial news and social media: While staying informed is essential, too much exposure to financial news and social media posts can increase the risk of information bias. Be selective and objective about the sources you follow, and set aside specific times to check the news.\nDiversify your information sources: Obtaining news and information from a variety of sources, including those that you tend to agree with and those that you tend not to, can help mitigate the impact of any single piece of information on your overall investment strategy and provide greater balance.\nBase decisions on objective analysis: Focus on the underlying financial health and business prospects of a company, rather than short-term market fluctuations or news events. Keep your long-term investment objectives in mind when making decisions, and avoid being swayed by emotions like fear or greed.\nSeek professional advice: Consult with a financial advisor or investment professional who can help you make well-informed investment decisions.\nInformation Bias and the ‘Market for Lemons’ \nThe information bias in the “Market for Lemons” refers to the fact that asymmetric information can lead to market failures. The idea was first introduced by economist George Akerlof in his widely cited 1970 paper, “The Market for ‘Lemons’: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism.” In his paper, a “lemon” refers to a used car with hidden defects that only the seller knows about, not the buyer. \nThis concept can be extended to other markets where the quality of goods is uncertain. The information bias in the lemons problem stems from the fact that sellers have more information about the quality of their goods than buyers do. As a result, buyers face uncertainty about the true quality of the goods they are purchasing, and they may be unwilling to pay a higher price for what they perceive as potentially low-quality goods.6 \nWhat other biases can affect investing decisions?\nWhat is behavioral economics?\nBehavioral economics is the synthesis of psychology and economics to understand how individuals actually make decisions in various real-world settings. It challenges the rational-actor model assumed by mainstream economics and uses experimental techniques to identify empirical phenomena.8 Behavioral finance is the application of behavioral economics to financial contexts, including investing.\nWhat is shared information bias?\nShared information bias is the tendency for group members to spend much of their time discussing information that the individuals in the group are already familiar with rather than seek out unfamiliar information. This can lead the group to reach suboptimal conclusions.\nThe Bottom Line \nBiased information is data or information that doesn’t accurately reflect the true state of the world. Information can become biased for several reasons, including mistakes in its collection or analysis, subconscious predilections when obtaining information, or deliberate distortion. \nIn behavioral economics, confirmation bias, recency (availability) bias, and asymmetric information are all information biases that can negatively influence investors’ decisions. Staying objective, obtaining information from a wide range of sources (including contradictory evidence), and soliciting the advice of others can help minimize these possible negative effects. \nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research.

  "text": "Tips for Long-Term Investors in Volatile Markets\nDuring volatile times, many investors get spooked and begin to question their long-term investment strategies. This is especially true for novice investors, who can often be tempted to pull out of the market altogether and wait on the sidelines until it seems safe to dive back in. \nThe thing to realize is that market volatility is inevitable. It's the nature of the markets to move up and down over the short term. Trying to time the market is extremely difficult. One solution is to maintain a long-term horizon and ignore the short-term fluctuations. \nFor many investors, this is a solid strategy, but even long-term investors should know about volatile markets and the steps that can help them weather this volatility. In this article, we'll show you how to do just that. \nKey Takeaways\nMarket volatility is inevitable: It's the nature of the markets to move up and down over the short term.\nVolatile markets are usually characterized by wide price fluctuations and heavy trading.\nOne way to deal with volatility is to avoid it altogether; this means staying invested and not paying attention to short-term fluctuations.\nIf you are trading in a volatile market, the limit order—an order placed with a brokerage to buy or sell and at or better than a specified price—is your friend.\nWhat Is Volatility? \nVolatility is a statistical measure of the tendency of a market or security to rise or fall sharply within a short period of time. It is typically measured by the standard deviation of the return of an investment over a certain period. Standard deviation is a statistical concept that denotes the amount of variation or deviation that might be expected and is the square root of the variance of returns. \nThe volatility of different types of investments will vary based on how much and how often their prices or returns move in a time period. For example, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) may have a standard deviation of around 15%, while a more stable investment, such as a certificate of deposit (CD), will typically have a standard deviation of nearly zero because the return never varies.1 \nVolatile markets are usually characterized by wide and rapid price fluctuations along with heavy trading. They can result from an imbalance of trade orders in one direction (for example, all buys and no sells). \nSome say volatile markets are caused by things like economic releases, company news, a recommendation from a well-known analyst, a popular initial public offering (IPO), or unexpected earnings results. Others blame volatility on day traders, short-sellers, and high-frequency firms. \nVolatility can also spike whenever fear or uncertainty in the market rises. One explanation is that investor reactions are caused by psychological forces. This theory, however, flies in the face of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which states that market prices are correct and adjust to reflect all information. \nThis behavioral approach says that substantial price changes (volatility) result from a collective change of mind by the investing public. It's clear there is no consensus on what causes volatility; but because volatility exists, investors must develop ways to deal with it. \nLong-Term Investing in a Volatile Market \nOne way to deal with volatility is to avoid it altogether. This means staying invested and not paying attention to short-term fluctuations. Sometimes this can be harder than it sounds—watching your portfolio take a 50% hit in a bear market can be more than most can take. \nBut, the standard advice is that for most long-term investors, the best way to deal with volatile markets is to remain calm and stay the course. Staying the course, however, is predicated on having a well-diversified and sound strategy, to begin with. \nOne common misconception about a buy-and-hold strategy is that holding a stock for 20 years is what will always make you money. Long-term investing still requires homework because markets are driven by corporate fundamentals. \n17.3%\nThe average return of the S&P 500 from 2011 to 2021.2\nIf you find a company with a strong balance sheet and consistent earnings, the short-term fluctuations won't affect the long-term value of the company. In fact, periods of volatility could be a great time to buy if you believe a company is good for the long term. \nThe main argument behind the buy-and-hold strategy is that missing the best few days of the year will cut your return significantly. It varies depending on where you get your data, but the statistic will usually sound something like this: \"Missing the 20 best days could cut your return by more than half.\" \nFor the most part, this is true. But on the other hand, missing the worst 20 days will also increase your portfolio considerably and in some cases, you may want to make trades during volatile market conditions. \nHow Investing May Be Affected During Times of Volatility \nInvestors, especially those that use an online broker, should know that during times of extreme volatility, many brokerages implement procedures designed to decrease the firm's exposure to extraordinary market risk. For example, in the past, some market-maker firms have temporarily discontinued normal automatic order executions and handled orders manually. \nHow securities are executed during times of volatile prices and high volume is also different in other ways. The following are some things you should be aware of: \nDelays: Volatile markets are associated with high volumes of trading, which may cause delays in execution. These high volumes may also cause executions to occur at prices that are very different from the market price quoted at the time the order was entered. Investors should ask firms to explain how market makers handle order executions when the market is volatile. With the proliferation of online trading, we have come to expect quick executions at prices at or near the quotes displayed on our internet-enabled devices. Take into account that this isn't always the case.\nDigital mayhem: You may have difficulty executing your trades because of the limitations of a system's capacity. In addition, if you are trading online, you may have trouble accessing your account due to high levels of internet traffic. For these reasons, most online trading firms offer alternatives like phone trades or talking to a broker over the phone to initiate an order.\nIncorrect quotes: There can be major price discrepancies between the quote you receive and the price at which your trade is executed. Remember, in a volatile market environment, even real-time quotes (RTQs) may be far behind what is currently happening in the market. In addition, the number of shares available at a certain price (known as the size of a quote) may change rapidly, affecting the likelihood of a quoted price being available to you.\nChoosing an Order Type in a Volatile Market \nThe type of order you choose is very important when the markets aren't moving in their normal fashion. A market order will always be executed, but, in fast markets, you might be surprised at what price you get. It can be substantially different from the quoted price. \nThe Bottom Line \nIn a volatile market, the limit order—an order placed with a brokerage to buy or sell at a predetermined amount of shares and at or better than a specified price—is your friend. Limit orders may cost slightly more than market orders but are always a good idea to use because the price at which you will purchase or sell securities is set. On the flip side, a limit order does not guarantee you an execution if the limit price is never triggered. \nInvestors need to be aware of the potential risks during times of volatility. Choosing to stay invested can be a great option if you're confident in your strategy. If, however, you do decide to trade during a spike in volatility, be aware of how the market conditions will affect your trade. \nShould I Sell Stocks When Markets Are Volatile?\nIn general, the answer is no (with caveats). Over time, market volatility subsides, and prices increase. Maintaining a long-term strategy through rocky patches can also allow you to accumulate more shares when stocks are on sale. If, however, you are in a position where you need the value of your assets fairly immediately or for income to live on (for instance, if you're a retiree), it may be best to rotate out of stocks and into more conservative investments when volatility strikes.\nShould I Buy Stocks When Prices Fall?\nFor long-term investors, buying into a down market can be a way to lower the dollar-cost-average (DCA) and pick up shares at better prices. If you were planning to buy $100 of stocks every month anyway over the course of several years, for instance, a volatile market can create lucrative buying opportunities.\nHow Can I Limit Losses to My Portfolio in a Volatile Market?\nIf you want to limit losses but do not want to sell your holdings, you can buy protective puts. These are options contracts that give you the right to sell the underlying stock or index at a specified price. You can set that specified price at some level below the current market, below which you want to be stopped out for losses (e.g., 10% below the current price). Buying options does incur some cost, so think of it as buying insurance on your portfolio.\nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research. Uphold allows you to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and over 260 crypto assets. Explore a variety of trading features and tools in a user-friendly platform that prioritizes transparency and is fully reserved.

  "text": "How to Use Benchmarks in Investing\nA benchmark is a standard or measure that can be used to analyze the allocation, risk, and return of a given portfolio. Individual funds and investment portfolios will generally have established benchmarks for standard analysis. A variety of benchmarks can also be used to understand how a portfolio is performing against various market segments. \nInvestors often use the S&P 500 index as an equity performance benchmark because the S&P contains 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies. However, there are many types of benchmarks that investors can use depending on their investments, risk tolerance, and time horizon. \nKey Takeaways\nA benchmark is a standard or measure that can be used to analyze the allocation, risk, and return of a given portfolio.\nA variety of benchmarks can also be used to understand how a portfolio is performing against various market segments.\nThe S&P 500 index is often used as a benchmark for equities.\nU.S. Treasuries are used for measuring bond returns and risk.\nUnderstanding Benchmarks \nBenchmarks represent a portfolio of unmanaged securities that represent a designated market segment. Institutions manage these portfolios which are known as indexes. Some of the most common institutions known for index management are Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Russell, and MSCI. \nIndexes act as a market proxy and represent various investment asset classes. A benchmark can include broad measures, such as the Russell 1000, or specific asset classes like U.S. small-cap growth stocks, high-yield bonds, or emerging markets.1 \nMany mutual funds in the investment industry use indexes as the base for a replication strategy. Mutual funds contain pools of investment funds that are actively managed by portfolio managers and invested in various securities, such as stocks, bonds, and money market instruments.2 Fund money managers attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors. \nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) also use indexes as the base for a passive replication strategy. ETFs typically track an index, such as the S&P 500 for equity ETFs. These ETFs invest in all the securities of the underlying index which is why they're considered to be passively managed funds.3 \nInvesting in a passive fund is the primary way that a retail investor can invest in an index. But the evolution of ETFs has brought about the introduction of smart beta indexes. These offer customized indexes that rival the capabilities of active managers. Smart beta indexes use advanced methodologies and a rules-based system for selecting investments to be held in portfolios.4 Smart beta funds represent the middle ground between a mutual fund and an ETF. \nA variety of benchmarks can also be used to understand how a portfolio is performing against various market segments.\nManaging Risk \nMost people invest in a diversified portfolio that includes numerous asset classes to help manage risk. They generally use equities and bonds. Risk metrics can be used to help understand the risks of these investments. \nRisk is most often characterized using variability and volatility. The size of the change in portfolio value measures volatility. Investment funds that contain commodities that have larger moves up and down in value have an increased amount of volatility. \nVariability measures the frequency of the change in value. Overall, the more variability, the greater the risk. \nSeveral measures are used to evaluate portfolio risk and reward. \nStandard Deviation \nStandard deviation is a statistical measure of volatility. It calculates the variance in price moves of an investment to the mean or average return over a period. The greater the variance between each price of the investment and the mean, the greater the price range or standard deviation. A higher standard deviation indicates more volatility and greater risk.5 \nBeta \nBeta is used to measure volatility against a benchmark. A portfolio with a beta of 1.2 is expected to move 120% up or down for every change in the benchmark. A portfolio with a lower beta would be expected to have less up-and-down movement than the benchmark. Beta is usually calculated with the S&P 500 as the benchmark.6 \nSharpe Ratio \nThe Sharpe Ratio is a widely used measure of risk-adjusted return. It's the average return earned more than a risk-free investment, such as a U.S. government bond. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a superior overall risk-adjusted return.7 \nThese measures are commonly reported with managed investment funds and also by index providers. \nPortfolios and Benchmarking \nFund companies use benchmarks as a gauge for the performance of a portfolio against its investing universe. Portfolio managers will generally choose a benchmark that's aligned with their investing universe. Active managers seek to outperform their benchmarks. They look to create a return beyond the return of the benchmark. \nBut an investor can't necessarily invest in all the securities of an index because all investing comes with some associated fees that will detract from the return of an index. \nInvestors can also use individual indexes combined with risk metrics to analyze their portfolios and choose portfolio allocations. Three benchmarks are commonly used for analyzing and understanding the market environment and various investment opportunities. \nThe S&P 500 \nAn investor may want to use the S&P 500 index as a benchmark for equities because it's the best gauge for large U.S. publicly traded companies. The S&P is the most widely used benchmark for equities. It's typically the litmus test for a portfolio's or fund's performance.8 \nThe Bloomberg Agg \nThe Agg or the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index measures the performance of various fixed-income securities. These include corporate bonds, U.S. government bonds, asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities that are traded in the United States.9 \nThe Agg is used by bond traders, mutual funds, and ETFs as a benchmark to measure the relative performance of the bond or fixed-income market. \nU.S. Treasuries \nU.S. Treasury securities are bonds that typically pay a fixed rate of return and they're backed by the U.S. Treasury. Treasuries are considered to be as safe an investment as possible.10 \nMany investment funds and portfolio managers use short-term Treasuries maturing in one or two years as a benchmark for the risk-free rate of return. The investment isn't worth the risk for investors if the rate cannot beat a one-year Treasury security. \nExamples of Benchmarking \nAn investor must first consider their risk to help determine an appropriate investment benchmark. An appropriate benchmark could be a 60% to 40% allocation if you're willing to take a moderate amount of risk because your profile is a six on a scale of 1-10. It would include: \n60% in a Russell 3000 Index investment that's focused on a market capitalization-weighted index universe that includes large-, mid-, and small-cap U.S. stocks11\n40% in a Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index investment which includes a universe of U.S. investment-grade government and corporate bonds9\nAn investor would use the Russell 3000 Index as a benchmark for equity and the Bloomberg Agg as a benchmark for fixed income in this scenario. They might also want to use the Sharpe Ratio to ensure that they're optimally diversified and achieve the greatest reward in each allocation for their risk. \nComprehensive Risk Considerations \nRisk is a central component of all investing decisions. An investor can better understand how to allocate their investments most prudently by simply using the performance and risk metrics of an index in comparison to investments. \nRisk levels usually vary across equity, fixed-income, and savings investments. Most investors with longer time horizons are willing to invest more heavily in higher-risk investments. Shorter time horizons or a higher need for liquidity or the ability to convert to cash will lead to lower-risk investments in fixed-income and savings products. \nInvestors can also use indexes and risk metrics to monitor their portfolios within the macro investing environment using these allocations as a guide.\nMarkets can gradually shift their levels of risk depending on various factors. Economic cycles and monetary policies can be leading variables affecting risk levels. Active investors who use appropriate benchmarking analysis techniques can often more readily capitalize on investment opportunities as they evolve. \nComparing the performance and risk of various benchmarks across an entire portfolio or specifically to investment fund mandates can also be important to ensure optimal investing. \nWhat Is an Index in Investing?\nAn index is effectively a benchmark. It's a measurement of changes in a securities market based on statistics. An index fund is a pooled investment vehicle that tracks specific indexes. Many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) track and mimic the performance of indexes so they're considered to be safer than some other types of investments.12\nWhat Is an Exchange-Traded Fund and Should I Invest in One?\nAn ETF is a pooled investment vehicle that's funded by numerous investors who receive an interest in the fund that's typically proportionate to their contributions. The fund is usually managed by an SEC-registered advisor firm. Some ETFs, such as index funds, are passively managed and track markets. Others are more actively managed and they trade on a more consistent basis.\nWhether should you invest in an ETF and which type of fund would work best for you can depend on your appetite for risk, but ETFs are considered to be on the safe side of investments overall.13\nWhat Does Volatility Mean in an Investment?\nVolatility is a measurement of how frequently and by how much the price of a given security shifts over a designated period. It has less of an effect on long-term investors because their goal is growth over a matter of years. It can create a bumpy, nerve-wracking road for short-term investors who want to buy in or out of the market at a specific, imminent time.14\nThe Bottom Line \nBenchmarks are tools that can be used in a variety of ways for investors. All managed funds will have an established benchmark by which you can measure the performance of the fund. \nInvestors can also go beyond standard uses of benchmarking. Using indexes to allocate investments to passive funds with specific portfolio allocations can be one advanced use of benchmarking. Active investors may also choose to follow an array of benchmarks across the risk spectrum, analyzing these benchmarks along with risk characteristics to ensure that their investments are optimally placed with the lowest risk and highest return possible. \nBenchmark and risk metric monitoring also allow investors to potentially identify opportunities for shifting portfolio investments to take advantage of market opportunities. \nConsidering different benchmarks simultaneously with their risk characteristics can be a simple technique for all types of investors. Using benchmarks can be very valuable in analyzing current and potential investments. It can also be an effective way to ensure that an investor’s portfolio is optimally diversified and aligned with their goals. \nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research.

  "text": "Most Valuable Autographs\nWhen you meet your favorite singer, actor, or sports figure, it can be thrilling. Naturally, you might want to commemorate this occasion by getting this person’s signature. \nLater on, you may think that autograph could become a collectible or quite valuable. The reality is, not all autographs will convert into cash. Whether or not an autograph has value beyond sentimental value will depend on several factors, including what surface it’s written on.\nKey Takeaways \nNot every signature will translate into a high-value autograph.\nA Hall of Fame baseball player’s autograph on a baseball or bat, or an actor’s autograph on the script for their Academy Award-winning movie, will likely have significant value.\nIf a signature is blurry, hard to read, or difficult to authenticate, it could have little to no value. \nHigh demand drives up the value of the autograph.\nWhat Determines the Value of an Autograph? \nNot every signature from a notable or famous person will translate into a high-value autograph. However, some factors will help improve the value of an autograph.\nCondition \nA signature that is clear and easy to read is more valuable. Even if it’s not easy to read, a signature may still be recognizable as the person’s iconic autograph and have some value. \nIf there are stains on the paper that make the signature difficult to read, that could diminish the value. After all, a blurry or hard-to-read signature can be difficult to authenticate, resulting in little to no value. \nWhat the Autograph Is Written on \nThe material or item that contains the autograph also has an impact on its value. Signatures on a piece of paper or in an autograph book probably won’t garner much value as signatures on unique items related to the person. \nFor example, if you have a Hall of Fame baseball player’s autograph on a baseball or bat, the autograph is likely to be worth a lot more than if it were on paper. Similarly, the signature of an actor on the script for their Academy Award-winning movie would also fetch more than just a signature on paper.1 \nRarity \nAs with all collectibles, if the item is more rare, it has more value. A rare signature will be in lower supply and higher demand, so it will yield a higher price tag. If there are many autographs of the person, say from someone generous with giving out their signature, their autograph can become less valuable. \nDemand for the Autograph \nIf a lot of collectors prize a particular autograph, it will be more valuable. Autographs that are very popular are in smaller supply compared to their demand. The markets change for which autographs are in high demand, depending on the celebrities or stars of the day. \nSimilarly, if someone is famous but no one wants their autograph, their signature will become less valuable.\nHow Much Can You Actually Get for an Autographed Item? \nPrices for autographs vary widely. They ultimately depend on what someone is willing to pay for it. If you have an autograph that you know others are willing to pay for, say an autographed rookie baseball card for Hall of Fame third baseman Chipper Jones, you likely could demand a higher price. eBay lists one for $79.2 \nKeep in mind that just because an autograph is listed for a certain price, it’s not necessarily worth that price. Again, it’s worth is what a buyer is willing to pay.\nConsider conducting research with companies that routinely sell autographed items, such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s, which are both notable auction houses that deal with high-value objects. Appraisers who specialize in autographed items also can give you an estimate of how much the autograph could be worth. \nHow Do I Sell a Valuable Autograph? \nWhere and how you sell an autograph depends on what you think it is worth. For instance, if you estimate that the autograph has a high value, you may want to work with a notable auction house like Christie’s or Sotheby’s to sell your item. \nIf the item has some value, you may consider having a reputable dealer sell the item on your behalf. Or you can try to sell the item yourself through online auction sites like eBay or online marketplaces like on Facebook. Most of these options will take a commission when selling your item for you, so be prepared to pay that fee once the sale is closed. \nWhat Are Some of the Most Valuable Autographed Items? \nThrough the years, some autographed items have commanded much more money than others. Valuable autographs have included signatures from presidents, athletes, and celebrities, among others. Examples include:\nGeorge Washington’s personal copy of the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Acts of the First Congress: $9.8 million (2012)3\nAbraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation: Of the 26 copies of the original 48 signed copies of this historic document that remain today, one copy formerly owned by Bobby Kennedy sold for $3.7 million in 2010.45 \nAlbert Einstein letter: Einstein documented his religious beliefs in a 1954 letter that sold for nearly $2.9 million in 2018.6\nBabe Ruth’s New York Yankees contract: $2.3 million (2017)7\nWhat Makes an Autograph Valuable?\nThe condition of the autograph, as well as what the autograph is written on, are among the factors that determine an autograph’s value. However, the most important factor is who the autograph belongs to, and whether it is in high demand. Whether or not the autograph is rare also plays a role in its value.\nHow Much Can I Sell an Autograph for?\nYou can sell an autograph for whatever price someone is willing to pay. However, to find a realistic price to list your autograph, check with auction houses, appraisers, or dealers, which can provide an estimate of the worth of your autograph.\nHow Do I Find Out What My Autograph Is Worth?\nYou can find out what your autograph is worth by having it appraised by a professional appraiser for a small fee, typically $30 to $40. They can give you an estimate of the autograph’s value along with some information on its authenticity.8\nThe Bottom Line \nThe most valuable autographs are those in good condition, signed on something considered noteworthy, and signed by an individual considered noteworthy. \nHow much you can actually sell the autograph for depends on the demand for the autograph and how much someone is willing to pay for it. If you have an autograph that you think could be extremely valuable, it’s important to have it authenticated by a professional at a notable auction house or by a reputable appraiser. \n$0 Down Loan Option for Veterans\nOwning your own home doesn’t have to be complicated.

  "text": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Before or After a New iPhone is Released?\nThe launch of the iPhone 16 series in September 2024 once again put Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the spotlight.1 However, the stock had a muted reaction following slower-than-expected sales of the updated release.2 \nThis raises an important question for AAPL investors: Does the stock go up when iPhones are released? In this article, we'll explore the relationship between iPhone releases and Apple's stock performance. \nKey Takeaways\nApple's stock often has volatility on iPhone launch days, including a short-term \"sell the news\" effect.\nPost-launch, successful new product releases can act as catalysts for stock growth.\nThe new series for Apple's iPhones typically launches annually in the Fall.\nMultiple factors beyond product launches influence Apple's overall stock performance.\nInvestors should always consider both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.\nHow Do iPhone Releases Impact Apple's Stock? \nHistorically, Apple's stock has exhibited mixed reactions to iPhone launch events. In the lead up to a new upgrade, the stock may rise, but on the day of the announcement, the stock often underperforms the market or experiences a slight decline. This phenomenon can be attributed to the \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" effect, which reflects the market's tendency to price in expectations before major announcements (even positive ones). \nHowever, after the initial dip, product releases serve as catalysts for subsequent stock increases. This pattern suggests that while short-term traders might see volatility around launch dates, long-term holders often benefit from sustained growth following successful product updates or introductions. \nInvestors should pay close attention to the days before and after a new product launch to gauge its demand. Positive reception and strong initial sales figures can drive the stock upward, while disappointment or production issues can lead to declines. \n52%\nApple iPhone sales account for half of all revenues for the company.3\nAs the AAPL price chart above illustrates (using a logarithmic price scale), Apple's stock fluctuated around iPhone launch periods. While not every launch correlates with immediate stock growth, the trajectory has been positive, reflecting the company's continued market dominance. \nWhat Other Factors Affect Apple's Stock? \nIn fact, after some releases, the stock remained flat or declined for several months before continuing its broader bullish trend. This is because, while important to the company, the iPhone is just one part of Apple's overall portfolio. \nWhile new iPhone features grab headlines, investors are increasingly focused on Apple's services growth and its potential in emerging technologies like AI.\nVarious products and services beyond the iPhone contribute to Apple's revenue and stock performance. These include the Mac lineup, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+ streaming service. The company's ecosystem creates multiple revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single product.4 Apple has also been attempting to derive a more significant proportion of its revenues from services since these are less reliant on the physical products that can be snarled by changing economic conditions, technological shifts, as well as inflationary, supply chain, and other pressures. \nIn 2023, Apple services accounted for more than a fifth, 22%, of all revenues.3 This has helped keep Apple's stock price moving up over the years. The chart below shows its stock price and the change in the value of a $10k investment in Apple over 30 years. \nWhile iPhone and other product launches are significant events for Apple, here are other factors that influence the company's stock performance: \nOverall market conditions: Broader economic trends and market sentiment can impact Apple's stock, regardless of product launches.\nSupply chain issues: Recent events, such as a 2024 fire at Tata's Plant Apple factory in India, highlight how supply chain disruptions can affect production and, consequently, stock performance.5\nCompetitive landscape: Competition in the smartphone and technology sectors often shifts Apple's market position. Samsung Electronics Company Ltd. (SSNLF), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Huawei, and other companies make high-performance phones and mobile devices competing with the iPhone.\nFinancial performance: Quarterly earnings reports, revenue growth, and profit margins are crucial in determining stock value.\nGeopolitical factors: Trade tensions, regulatory changes, and global economic shifts can impact Apple's operations and stock performance.\nIntroduction of new product categories: Announcements or rumors about new product categories often have driven moves in Apple's stock price.\nWho Owns the Most AAPL Stock?\nThe top holders of AAPL stock are institutional owners, which include the Vanguard Group, BlackRock Finance Inc. (BLK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A).6\nIs AAPL a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, 32 out of 38 analysts covering the stock have a \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" recommendation on AAPL stock, with an average near-term price target of around 5% to 7% higher than the present share price.7\nWhen Is the iPhone 17 Coming Out?\nApple usually releases its newest iPhone series in the Fall (September or October) of each consecutive year. The iPhone 16 was released in September 2024, so the iPhone 17 should be released in the Fall of 2025. For the most accurate information, keep an eye on official announcements from Apple.\nThe Bottom Line \nApple's annual iPhone release, typically in September, often creates a buzz in the stock market. Investors closely watch these events, as the iPhone remains Apple's flagship product and a significant revenue driver. However, the stock's performance during this period isn't always predictable. While positive reception to new iPhone features can boost share prices, the stock sometimes experiences a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" effect, where prices rise in anticipation but dip after the announcement. \nSeveral factors influence Apple's stock around iPhone launches. These include pre-order numbers, analyst projections, and broader market conditions. Supply chain issues or production delays can also impact investor sentiment. Apple's stock performance is increasingly tied to its growing services segment and other product lines, not just iPhone sales. Potential investors should consider Apple's overall financial health, competitive position, and long-term strategy rather than focusing solely on iPhone launch events. \nAAPL \nAAPL \nMichael M.

  "text": "7 Steps to a Successful Investment Journey\nThe most successful investors were not made in a day. Learning the ins and outs of the financial world and your personality as an investor takes time and patience, not to mention trial and error. In this article, we'll lead you through the first seven steps of your expedition into investing and show you what to look out for along the way. \nKey Takeaways\nYour investing journey starts with a plan and a time frame; when you know how long you're investing for and what you hope to gain, you can put the structure in place to achieve it.\nNext, learn about how the market works, figure out what investment strategy is best for you, and determine what kind of investor you are.\nBe careful who you're taking advice from and be mindful of your own prejudices and assumptions, as you find the right path for you.\nMake sure you understand this is a long-term journey so that you won't get tripped up by short-term setbacks; always stay open and learn from your mistakes.\n1. Getting Started in Investing \nSuccessful investing is a journey, not a one-time event, and you'll need to prepare yourself as if you were going on a long trip. Begin by defining your destination, then plan your investment journey accordingly. For example, are you looking to retire in 20 years at age 55? How much money will you need to do this? You must first ask these questions. The plan that you come up with will depend on your investment goals. \n2. Know What Works in the Market \nRead books or take an investment course that deals with modern financial ideas. The people who came up with theories such as portfolio optimization, diversification, and market efficiency received their Nobel prizes for good reason. Investing is a combination of science (financial fundamentals) and art (qualitative factors). \nThe scientific aspect of finance is a solid place to start and should not be ignored. If science is not your strong suit, don't fret. There are many texts, such as Stocks for the long run by Jeremy Siegel, that explain high-level finance ideas in a way that is easy to understand.1 \nOnce you know what works in the market, you can come up with simple rules that work for you. For example, Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors ever. His simple investment style is summed up in this well-known quote: \"Never invest in a business you cannot understand.\" It has served him well. While he missed the tech upturn, he avoided the subsequent devastating downturn of the high-tech bubble of 2000. \n3. Know Your Investment Strategy \nNobody knows you and your situation better than you do. Therefore, you may be the most qualified person to do your own investing—all you need is a bit of help. Identify the personality traits that will assist you or prevent you from investing successfully, and manage them accordingly. \nA very useful behavioral model that helps investors to understand themselves was developed by fund managers Tom Bailard, Larry Biehl, and Ron Kaiser. \nImage by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019 \nThe model classifies investors according to two personality characteristics: method of action (careful or impetuous) and level of confidence (confident or anxious).2 \nBased on these personality traits, the BB&K model divides investors into five groups: \nIndividualist – careful and confident, often takes a do-it-yourself approach\nAdventurer – volatile, entrepreneurial, and strong-willed\nCelebrity – a follower of the latest investment fads\nGuardian – highly risk-averse, wealth preserver\nStraight Arrow – shares the characteristics of all of the above equally\nNot surprisingly, the best investment results tend to be realized by an individualist, or someone who exhibits analytical behavior and confidence and has a good eye for value. However, if you determine that your personality traits resemble those of an adventurer, you can still achieve investment success if you adjust your strategy accordingly. \nIn other words, regardless of which group you fit into, you should manage your core assets in a systematic and disciplined way. \n4. Know Your Friends and Enemies \nBeware of false friends who only pretend to be on your side, such as certain unscrupulous investment professionals whose interests may conflict with yours. You must also remember that, as an investor, you are competing with large financial institutions that have more resources, including greater and faster access to information. \nBear in mind you are potentially your own worst enemy. Depending on your personality, strategy, and particular circumstances, you may be sabotaging your own success. A guardian would be going against their personality type if they were to follow the latest market craze and seek short-term profits. \nBecause you are risk-averse and a wealth preserver, you would be affected far more by large losses that can result from high-risk, high-return investments. Be honest with yourself, and identify and modify the factors preventing you from investing successfully or moving you away from your comfort zone. \n5. Find the Right Investing Path \nYour level of knowledge, personality, and resources should determine the path you choose. Generally, investors adopt one of the following strategies: \nDon't put all of your eggs in one basket. In other words, diversify.\nPut all of your eggs in one basket, but watch your basket carefully.\nCombine both of these strategies by making tactical bets on a core passive portfolio.\nMost successful investors start with low-risk diversified portfolios and gradually learn by doing. As investors gain greater knowledge over time, they become better suited to taking a more active stance in their portfolios. \nOnline brokers have an abundance of tools that can help investors of all levels; we've done an extensive review and ranking of more than 70 online brokers to find the best one for you.\n6. Be in It for the Long Term \nSticking with the optimal long-term strategy may not be the most exciting investing choice. However, your chances of success should increase if you stay the course without letting your emotions, or \"false friends,\" get the upper hand. \n7. Be Willing To Learn \nThe market is hard to predict, but one thing is certain: it will be volatile. Learning to be a successful investor is a gradual process and the investment journey is typically a long one. At times, the market will prove you wrong. Acknowledge that and learn from your mistakes. \nHow Should a Beginner Start to Invest?\nThe first step a new investor should take is to determine their investment goals \"Why are you investing?\" Are you planning for retirement? Saving up to buy a house? Knowing your goals will guide your investment decisions. From there, determine your investment vehicles, such as purchasing stocks, investing in ETFs or mutual funds, setting up a retirement account, and so on. You should also consider how much you want to invest as well as your time horizon.\nWhat Are Good Beginner Investments?\nOne of the best ways to start investing is by contributing to your retirement account at work if you have one. If your company has a 401(k) for example, you can start contributing there. If it does not, you can start retirement planning on your own with an IRA. From there, a simple way to invest is by putting money in an index fund; funds that track an index such as the S&P 500. These funds, particularly exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are easy to buy and sell, come with low fees, and provide a wide breadth of exposure to the markets.\nHow Much Money Do I Need to Start Investing?\nYou can start investing with any amount of money. If you have a retirement plan at work, you can allocate part of your salary to contribute to the plan. If there is a stock you want to buy, you only need enough to buy one share to get started.\nThe Bottom Line \nStarting to invest can be an exciting time but also challenging for newcomers. There are lots of financial products and plenty of different investment advice out there. As you start, first educate yourself on investing, lay out your financial goals, and don't rush to make a fortune. Taking the time to learn about investing and carefully making the right choices for you should allow you to generate a tidy return. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "How Much Could You Make in 20 Years Investing $200 in Gold?\nUnderstanding Gold as an Investment \nFor many centuries, gold has been a popular investment because it's a store of value and helps protect against rising prices. Many investors put part of their portfolios in gold, seeing it as a way to diversify and safeguard their wealth during periods of economic uncertainty. But just how much could you make investing in gold over the long term? \nLet's say you had an extra $200 to invest. While returns vary based on market conditions and growth rates, a $200 investment in gold in 2000, for example, would have been worth over $800 by 2020 and nearly $1,900 by 2024. \nOf course, like any investment, putting your money into gold involves risks. Its price can be volatile, and it doesn't provide any interest or dividends—you don't make money just by holding onto it. Owning physical gold also comes with security and storage needs. Still, gold has hit records recently, and with future uncertainty about the economy and geopolitics, it may continue even higher. Read on to learn more about how to invest in gold and what that entails.\nKey Takeaways\nGold investments include the physical metal, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and stocks in gold mining companies.\nHistorical performance, inflation, and political events have a significant influence on gold prices.\nPotential returns on a $200 investment in gold over 20 years can vary based on historical data and growth rates.\nComparing gold to other investments like stocks, real estate, and bonds provides a broader perspective on potential returns.\nUnderstanding the risks, such as unpredictable price shifts and storage considerations, is crucial when investing in gold.\nGold's Historical Performance \nOver the past 50 years, gold prices have changed significantly, influenced by many economic and political events. In 1972, when the U.S. dollar became a free-floating fiat currency, gold traded under $100 per ounce (about $479 when adjusted for inflation).1 Over the next decade, gold embarked on a historic stretch of ever-rising prices, reaching a then-record high of around $840 in 1980 (just over $3,000 inflation-adjusted) amid double-digit inflation in the U.S. and political tensions like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and oil embargoes.2345 \nThe chart below provides the changes in the price of gold, adjusted to 2024 prices: \nAfter the record highs in 1980, gold prices retreated in the 1980s and 1990s as inflation cooled and the stock market boomed. The precious metal traded between $300 and $500 per ounce for nearly 20 years before sinking to near-term lows by 2000. However, gold regained its luster in the 2000s, almost doubling from $500 in 2005 ($825 in today's dollars) to over $1,000 by 2008 ($1,495 in today's dollars).2 \nThe 2008 financial crisis was a significant turning point for gold prices. As the U.S. housing bubble burst and the stock market crashed, investors bought gold as a safe haven asset. Its price surged to an all-time high near $1,900 in 2011 ($2,740 in today's dollars) as the U.S. Federal Reserve launched an unprecedented monetary stimulus to support the economy.67 \nGold's rally was also fueled by the European debt crisis and the credit agency Standard & Poor's first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating in the early 2010s.89 \nAfter peaking in 2011, gold dropped in value over several years as stocks bounced back and the U.S. dollar strengthened. Prices bottomed out around $1,100 in late 2015 ($1,480 in today's dollars) before heading back up. By 2020, gold had returned to above $1,800, boosted by the pandemic, record-low interest rates, and massive fiscal and monetary stimulus worldwide. \nIn 2024, gold broke above $2,000 per ounce and hit record highs (nominal, meaning not adjusted for inflation), heading north of $2,600 in September 2024.2 Below are the nominal price shifts in gold since 1970: \nPotential Returns on a $200 Investment in Gold \nWhat returns could a $200 investment in gold have achieved over the past 20 years? Let's analyze the historical data and explore two different growth scenarios. \nIf you had invested $200 in gold in September 2004 when the price was around $400 per ounce, your investment would have bought you half an ounce of gold. By September 2024, with gold trading at record highs above $2,600 per ounce, that half ounce would be worth about $1,300. Over those 20 years, your $200 investment would have grown to $1,300, a 550% return or 10.6% annual growth rate.\nHowever, if you had instead invested in September 2011 near gold's previous peak of around $1,900, your $200 would have only bought about 0.11 ounces of gold. By September 2024, at $2,600 per ounce, that investment would be worth about $286, a 43% total return or 2.8% annualized over 13 years. This highlights the importance of entry timing and the variability of returns.\nFor comparison, we've provided the shifts in the price of gold since 2000 and compared them with changes in the value of the S&P 500 index, which tracks 500 of the largest and most stable firms publicly traded in the U.S. and is used as a barometer for the stock market as a whole. \nCompounding and Growth Rates \nCompound growth can significantly impact investment returns over long periods. Here's how different compounded annual growth rates (CAGRs) would affect a $200 gold investment over 20 years, ranging from the most conservative estimates that would merely keep up with inflation (say, 3%) to aggressive growth rates that reflect a very bullish long-term outlook (say 12%): \nAt a 3% CAGR, $200 would grow to $362\nAt a 5% CAGR, $200 would grow to $530\nAt a 7% CAGR, $200 would grow to $773\nAt a 10% CAGR, $200 would grow to $1,345\nAt a 12% CAGR: $200 would grow to $1,929\nOf course, gold's actual growth rate is unlikely to be smooth or predictable. Gold prices often shift significantly from year to year. These scenarios are thus hypothetical and not predictive of actual returns. They simply illustrate how different growth rate assumptions can impact investment outcomes. However, they illustrate the power of compounding over long time horizons. Investors should consider their own views and risk tolerance when evaluating the potential returns of gold over long periods. \nFactors Influencing Gold Prices \nGold prices are shaped by a range of economic, political, and market forces that interact. Understanding these price drivers can help you anticipate and navigate the twists and turns of the gold market. \nOf course, no one has a crystal ball, and unexpected events can always shake up even the best-calculated forecasts. The key is to be attentive to gold's ever-changing fundamentals while also maintaining a long-term perspective that aligns with your investment goals. \nSupply and Demand \nAt the most fundamental level, gold prices are a function of supply and demand. While gold mining adds to supply each year, gold's overall supply grows very slowly since most of the metal ever mined remains in existence as a store of value. \nOn the demand side, gold is sought for both industrial uses and investment purposes. Jewelry fabrication and electronics manufacturing create a base level of demand, while investment demand can fluctuate more dramatically based on economic conditions and market sentiment. When gold demand outpaces supply, prices tend to rise. But for many, its an evergreen investment—it's consistently popular with retail investors, and many years it's more popular than stocks for investments purposes, as the chart below shows. \nMarket Conditions \nBroader financial market conditions can significantly impact the gold market. During periods of strong economic growth and rising corporate profits, gold may not perform as well as assets like stocks. Conversely, during recessions or bear markets, gold tends to do better because many people fleeing the stock market use gold as a safe haven to store some of their capital. \nMomentum and Sentiment \nLike many other financial assets, gold is influenced by momentum and investor sentiment. During bull markets in gold, when there are rising prices, this increase in value itself will attract more buyers into the market, fueling further gains. The opposite cycle can occur in bear markets, with everyone hoping not to be the last to bail as the price of gold tumbles. \nProfessional investors and speculators can build on these momentum swings by trading large quantities of gold futures or ETFs. Media coverage, analyst forecasts, and technical chart patterns can also shape short-term gold market sentiment. \nPolitical Events \nBecause of its long history as a universally recognized store of value and safe haven asset, gold is particularly sensitive to political instability. Wars, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other shocks can dramatically boost demand for gold and its perceived safety. For example, gold prices surged to then-record highs in 1980 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.24 More recently, tensions in the Middle East have helped fuel a gold rally.10 \nIn addition to these acute events, slow-burning global trends like the rise of China and the supposed decline of U.S. hegemony may also shape gold's outlook over longer periods. \nCurrency Fluctuations \nThe U.S. dollar's relative value heavily influences gold prices in foreign exchange (forex) markets. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially lowering international demand. Conversely, a weaker dollar can boost gold's appeal as an alternative store of value. \nPeriods of dollar weakness, like the 1970s or the mid-2000s, have historically coincided with strong gold markets.112 Beyond the dollar, gold can also be affected by changes in the value of other major currencies like the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound. \nInflation and Real Interest Rates \nU.S. real interest rates, or nominal rates adjusted for inflation, are arguably the most critical driver of gold prices. Because gold offers no yield, it's typically more attractive when real interest rates are low or negative (i.e., when inflation is high). This means the opportunity cost of holding gold over other yield-bearing assets is lower. \nMeanwhile, high real interest rates make gold relatively less attractive. U.S. real interest rates peaked in the early 1980s amid then-U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker's inflation fight, ushering in a 20-year bear market for gold. Real interest rates plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, fueling gold's rally to record highs above $1,900.12136 A chart of these rates since 1970 is below. \nThe Fed and Monetary Policy \nThe Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions often have an outsized effect on the gold market. By setting short-term interest rates and controlling the money supply, the Fed heavily influences real interest rates and the dollar's value, two critical variables for gold prices. \nQuantitative easing and other expansionary monetary policies are generally bullish for gold, as they tend to depress real interest rates and the dollar. Conversely, rate hikes and quantitative tightening can create headwinds for gold. Gold sold off sharply in 2013 during the \"Taper Tantrum\" following the Fed's suggestion it would wind down asset purchases.14 Similarly, gold came under pressure in 2022 as the Fed embarked on its fastest rate hike cycle since the 1980s to combat soaring inflation.212 \nOther Factors \nCentral bank demand: Foreign central banks hold gold as part of their reserves, and their buying or selling can move the market. For example, the People's Bank of China has been steadily accumulating gold since 2019.1516\nETF inflows/outflows: Flows in and out of gold-backed ETFs can certainly affect prices. ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) are very popular investment vehicles.\nMining technology: While a slow-moving factor, changes in gold mining output at the margins can influence the balance of supply and demand over time.\nCrypto competition: The rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is an emerging factor in the gold market. Some have argued that crypto could divert demand away from gold among younger investors seeking an alternative store of value. However, the rise in the value of bitcoin has not affected the similar rise between 2023 to 2024 in the price of gold.\nComparing Gold to Other Investments \nOver the past decades, gold and stocks have seen alternating periods of outperformance. In the 1970s, gold soared while stocks slumped amid high inflation and economic stagnation. The 1980s and 1990s saw stocks take the lead as gold languished. Gold shone again in the 2000s as the dot-com bubble burst, and later, the financial crisis unfolded. Stocks ultimately recovered and pushed upward toward new highs in the 2010s. During the 2020s, both stocks and gold have seen new all-time highs.\nFrom 2003 through 2023, gold returned about 8.9% annually, slightly outperforming the S&P 500's 8.4% annual return (excluding dividends). However, the S&P 500 averaged over 10% annually, including dividends. Gold's returns were less impressive over a longer time horizon. From 1971 through 2023, gold returned under 8% compared with the 10.7% total return for the S&P 500.\nOf course, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and investors are wise to maintain a well-diversified portfolio that includes several asset classes. The best asset allocation varies based on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Thus, investors should consider gold a potential component of a diversified portfolio, not a stand-alone investment. And, as with any investment, it's prudent to consult with a financial advisor to determine whether and how gold fits into your broader financial plan.\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was launched in 2009. From 2014 to 2024, bitcoin returned a massive 68% annually vs. 8.5% for gold over the same period. However, these eye-popping returns came with extreme volatility and price crashes.172\nBenefits and Risks of Investing in Gold \nBenefits of Investing in Gold \nGold offers several potential benefits for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against various economic and market risks. One of gold's primary advantages is its historically low correlation to other asset classes like stocks and bonds. This means that gold prices often move independently of other financial markets, potentially providing a buffer against market downturns or volatility. By adding gold to a portfolio, investors may be able to improve risk-adjusted returns and reduce overall portfolio volatility.\nAnother key benefit of gold is its reputation as an inflation hedge. Over long periods, gold has demonstrated a tendency to maintain its purchasing power, making it an attractive store of value during times of rising prices or currency debasement. This was particularly evident during the high inflation of the 1970s and the early 2000s when the U.S. dollar weakened. Gold's status as a tangible, universally recognized asset has also made it a sought-after safe haven during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Investors often flock to gold during market crashes, financial crises, or political instability, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 market turmoil in 2020.\nWhile gold does not provide regular income like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, it does have a history of price appreciation, albeit with its ups and downs. Some portfolio optimization studies suggest that putting a small part of an investment portfolio in gold can improve risk-adjusted returns.18\nRisks of Investing in Gold \nDespite its potential benefits, investing in gold also carries several risks that investors must consider. One of the most significant risks is gold's price volatility. While often viewed as a stable store of value over the long term, gold prices can fluctuate dramatically in the short term based on a variety of factors, as well as experience prolonged bear markets. This volatility can be particularly challenging for investors with shorter time horizons or lower risk tolerance.\nAnother potential drawback of gold as an investment is its lack of income generation. Unlike bonds, which pay regular interest, or stocks, which can pay dividends, gold does not produce any cash flow. This lack of income can create an opportunity cost for investors, particularly in higher interest-rate environments where income-generating assets may be more attractive. \nInvestors who opt to own physical gold bullion must also contend with storage and security challenges. Secure storage and insurance for gold bars or coins can be costly and logistically complex, often requiring allocated storage with a bullion dealer or a bank safe deposit box, which come with additional fees and potential counterparty risks.\nPros and Cons of Gold Investments\nPros\nLong-term store of value\nInflation hedge\nPortfolio diversifier\nSafe haven asset\nCons\nVolatility\nNo dividend or cash flows\nCosts to secure physical gold\nMay underperform other assets like stocks\nTips for Investing in Gold \nChoose the Right \"Form\" of Gold \nOne of the first decisions gold investors must make is which form of gold to invest in. The three main options are often physical gold bullion (bars or coins), gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks. \nPhysical gold: Owning physical gold provides the most direct exposure to gold prices and offers the satisfaction of tangible ownership. However, investing in physical gold also involves storage and security costs and potential liquidity issues when it comes time to sell. If you invest in physical gold, consider reputable bullion dealers and secure storage options like bank safe deposit boxes or allocated storage with a bullion depositary. Gold coins, such as American Gold Eagles or Canadian Gold Maple Leafs, can be easier to trade than gold bars because of their smaller size and broader recognition.\nGold ETFs and mutual funds: Gold ETFs and mutual funds can be attractive for investors seeking exposure to gold prices without the hassle of physical ownership. These funds, such as the SPDR Gold Trust or iShares Gold Trust (IAU), often hold physical gold bullion and aim to track the price of gold. Gold ETFs offer greater liquidity and lower transaction costs than buying and selling physical gold. They also eliminate the need for individual investors to arrange for storage and security. However, gold ETFs do come with management fees and may not match the price of gold perfectly.\nGold mining stocks: Investing in shares of gold mining companies provides indirect exposure to gold prices. They might also offer dividend income, which physical gold or gold-holding ETFs cannot. However, gold mining stocks carry sector-specific and company-specific risks, such as operational issues, political risks, and financial leverage. They also may not always track gold prices directly, as production costs, management decisions, and hedging strategies can influence mining company performance. When investing in gold miners, it's important to research individual companies and consider diversifying across multiple miners to guard against losing too much in any one company.\nUltimately, the choice between physical gold, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and desired level of direct exposure to gold prices. Many investors choose to allocate funds across all three categories to balance the risks and rewards of each. \nTime Your Investment \nTiming gold purchases is challenging, as a myriad economic, geopolitical, and market factors can influence gold prices. However, some general principles can guide your timing decisions. \nBuy low, sell high: As with any investment, the ideal scenario is to buy gold when prices are low and sell when they are high. While this is easier said than done, investors can watch for opportunities to buy during price pullbacks or periods of market pessimism. Conversely, periods of heightened investor enthusiasm or speculative fervor in the gold market can be a good time to trim your position.\nDollar cost averaging (DCA): For investors making ongoing gold purchases, DCA can be used to manage the risk of not timing investments right. By investing a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals (e.g., monthly), you can avoid the temptation to time the market and naturally buy more gold when prices are low and less when they are high. Over time, this can help average out your purchase prices and mitigate the impact of short-term price volatility.\nReal interest rates: As discussed earlier, gold prices have historically been inversely correlated with real interest rates (nominal rates minus inflation). When real rates are low or negative, the opportunity cost of holding gold is lower, supporting gold prices.\nMonitor market sentiment: Gold prices are heavily influenced by market sentiment and investor psychology. During periods of high uncertainty, fear, or pessimism, the demand for gold often rises as investors seek safe havens. Conversely, gold may underperform other assets during periods of optimism or risk appetite. Monitoring market sentiment indicators like the CBOE Gold Volatility Index (called the Gold VIX, its ticker is GVZ) or the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Index can provide insight into the emotional state of the gold market.1920\nConsider seasonal patterns: Some investors and analysts have noted seasonal patterns in gold prices. For example, gold demand tends to rise in September and October because of jewelry purchases ahead of the Indian wedding season and Christmas.21 Prices may also increase in January as investors put some of their funds in gold at the start of the year. While not foolproof, understanding these seasonal tendencies can help you determine when to invest in gold.\nUltimately, trying to perfectly time gold purchases is difficult even for professional investors. A more prudent approach for most individual investors is to focus on their long-term allocation strategy and use tools like DCA to manage timing risk. \nDiversify \nFinally, diversification is crucial when investing in gold or any other asset class. By spreading your investments across multiple assets, sectors, and geographies, you can reduce portfolio risk and volatility. It's thus important to view gold as just one part of a larger investment portfolio. \nWhat Are the Tax Implications of Investing in Gold?\nIn the U.S., physical gold is classified as a collectible for tax purposes, resulting in higher long-term capital gains rates than securities like stocks or bonds. Gold ETFs and mining stocks are taxed as investments. In either case, they would be subject to capital gains tax (the rate depending on the holding period).2223\nIs Gold Always a Good Hedge Against Inflation?\nGold is often considered a hedge against inflation, as it is thought to increase in value as the buying power of the dollar declines. However, its actual track record has been mixed.24 In fact, evidence shows that gold hasn’t always been a good hedge against inflation. It all depends on the time frame you are considering. For example, gold investors lost 10% on average from 1980 to 1984 in real terms when the annual inflation rate was about 6.5%.25\nWhy Is Gold So Valuable?\nGold is a rare and precious metal with unique properties: it is durable and long-lasting, conducts electricity well, is malleable, has an attractive luster and shine, and is resistant to corrosion and oxidation. This makes it useful in a wide range of applications. Gold is also relatively scarce, making it increasingly difficult to find and extract from the earth.\nMost importantly, however, gold is precious because of its social and cultural importance.\nThe Bottom Line \nGold has recently seen new all-time highs (in nominal terms). A $200 investment in gold could grow at least four times over 20 years based if historical growth rates hold. But that depends on exactly when your money is invested. Indeed, gold prices are unpredictable, and gains aren't guaranteed. \nAs part of a diversified portfolio, gold can serve as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty. Still, it's crucial to understand the risks involved and invest with a long time horizon in mind. While not a \"get rich quick\" scheme, disciplined gold investing can augment your wealth over time.",

  "text": "eToro vs. Webull\nWebull and eToro both have origins outside of the United States. eToro was launched in 2007 in Israel and began operating in the U.S. in 2018 as a crypto platform, with expanded assets added in January 2022.1 Not your typical investing app, eToro has similarities with a social media platform with the social trading aspect of the platform known as CopyTrader.2 CopyTrader users copy popular traders and interact with others on the home page “social feed.” With limited stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies, eToro is a bit short of a comprehensive trading platform. \nIn contrast, Chinese-owned Webull offers a more comprehensive investment and trading platform than eToro. Launched in 2017, Webull offers access to nearly the entire stock and ETF universe, options, margin investing, and now futures, making it a fit for beginner investors to intermediate traders. Webull offers a comprehensive trading platform, with features for both fundamental and technical traders. We should note the company has recently split off its cryptocurrency arm into a different entity, Webull Pay, so it no longer has those assets on the platform.3 There are no trading commissions at Webull, adding to the allure of this snappy investing platform. We’ll delve into the features, similarities, and differences between eToro and Webull to help you decide which investment platform is best for your needs. \nWarning\nDon’t invest in cryptocurrency unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Take two minutes to learn more.\nAccount Minimum: $50-$200 minimum deposit for most regions, $200 minimum per trader for copy trading features, $500 minimum investment for Portfolio \nFees: 1% crypto trading fee plus market spread; no-fee stock, ETF, and options trading ($1-$2 per trade fee in select few countries), plus market spread; 2% crypto asset transfer fee \nAccount Minimum: $0 \nFees: $0 commissions for stock, ETF, and options \nUsability \nOn the surface, both eToro and Webull offer clean, slick interfaces with good user experience on each platform (web-based and app). The eToro website focuses first on the social aspect of the platform, with the user news feed on the home page. The eToro website and app are similar, with your portfolio and access to all assets via the “Discover” tab on the home screen. The eToro platform is more limited, with less research, fewer tradable assets, and a less sophisticated platform than Webull. \nThe strong social aspect is reflected in the user experience. eToro’s unique social features, CopyTrader for cryptocurrencies and the Popular Investor Program, distinguish it from Webull. These features make it easy to follow the trades of other investors and add to the social aspect of the app. This can be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending upon the profitability of the expert trades and your interest in this modernized version of coattail investing. \nWebull offers web-based and downloadable trading platforms and a mobile app, which approximates the features of the computer-based experience. Webull surprises on the upside with excellent usability for such a feature-rich platform. The menu items connect to customizable quotes, stock and ETF detail pages, a customizable trading screen, and a comprehensive account tab. \nUsability Verdict: Webull \nWhile we enjoyed the social experience of eToro, Webull takes the edge in usability by having surprisingly intuitive and feature-rich platforms.\nTrade Experience \nDesktop Experience \nInvestors can trade from several screens in eToro, including the Trade, Watchlist, and Discover tabs. The eToro platform offers real-time quotes, along with ETF, stock, and cryptocurrency investing. The distinctive CopyTrader and Popular Investor Program features, in addition to the social news feed, create a game-like environment and might minimize the importance of investment research and the risk inherent in the financial markets.4 The Popular Investor Program facilitates the sharing of trading insights and knowledge and provides compensation to popular investors with more followers. The custom watchlists are synced across desktop and mobile platforms and can be customized with volatility alerts as well. eToro’s research and screeners are barebones, with minimal features and customization. \nIt’s also important to note that when markets decline, no shorting is allowed. This takes a tool designed for declining markets out of the hands of the expert traders and their followers, limiting their ability to adapt to market conditions. Moreover, eToro’s lack of proper volume indicators reduces the accuracy of any volume-related investment strategies. \nWebull’s web-based and downloadable trading tools and features are more comprehensive than those at eToro. The updated Webull 8.0 adds greater customization and additional features to the trading experience. The platform provides templates for stock, ETF, and options trading. In line with more established and larger investment brokers, the features include additional technical indicators, deeper market news, additional tools for technical and fundamental analysis, and advanced customizable charting.5 The research continues to impress with probability and testing capabilities not often found in a streamlined investment app like Webull. \nDesktop Experience Verdict: Webull \nAll in all, eToro leans towards confusing investing with social interaction, while Webull is a better fit for new to intermediate investors and traders looking for a feature-rich trading platform. \nMobile Experience \nThe mobile experience is comparable to the desktop versions at eToro and Webull. The eToro mobile app is unique within the investment app arena in that it has a social feed. This facilitates interaction with other investors and offers easy access to popular investor profiles. Beginners may like the familiar social media-like feel, while experienced investors looking to trade may be put off by the app's creative user experience. \nThe Webull 8.0 app’s features strengthen the mobile experience as well. Like the desktop version, the app has customizable charting, alerts, options trading, and financial reporting. Advanced traders can access smart trading tools, including 50 technical indicators, 15 charting tools, and the ability to place orders directly from the chart.6 The updated mobile app is designed for excellent performance on a small screen. \nMobile Experience Verdict: Webull \nThe mobile app at Webull is best for serious beginners to advanced investors and traders looking to research investments and trade stocks, ETFs, and options. Beginners might like eToro, but should be mindful about copying others without a basic understanding of investment principles and markets. \nNew & Notable\nOn March 11, 2024, Webull announced its plans to expand into commodities and futures trading, ahead of a planned listing later in the year. The new offerings will focus on highly liquid futures markets with features including market, limit, stop market, and stop-limit orders. Webull said customers will also gain exposure to underlying asset classes such as commodities, currencies, and indexes.7\nRange of Offerings \nBoth eToro and Webull offer stock, ETF, futures, and options, but that’s where the similarities end. Webull users can access roughly all of the 10,000 U.S. traded stocks and ETFs and can trade long and short. eToro offers a crypto wallet to support its cryptocurrency trading capabilities, while in 2023, Webull moved crypto trading into a separate business that customers now access through the new Webull Pay app.8 \neToro users can trade 3,250 stocks, 270 ETFs, futures, and 24 cryptocurrencies.9 This range of crypto landed eToro our best pick for crypto in the 2024 broker review, but we should note a cryptocurrency exchange obviously has a lot more. Neither platform offers bonds, mutual funds, or other asset classes, but Webull indicates fixed income is coming. \nRange of Offerings Verdict: Webull \neToro clearly has the edge in crypto, but we found Webull had a deeper pool of stocks and ETFs available. The most commonly traded assets are available at both brokers, but Webull simply offers more of them. \nCompare Range of Offerings \nOrder Types \neToro enables simple orders like market, limit, and stop loss, but lacks more complex order types. At Webull, users will find all the typical orders as well as specialty conditional orders like one-cancels-the-other (OCO), one-triggers-an-OCO (OTOCO), and one-triggers-the-other (OTO), giving it the edge in this category. \nOrder Types Verdict: Webull \nIt is important to note that larger brokers have an even wider selection of order types. That said, Webull offers basic and complex orders that will meet the needs of the majority of traders. \nTrading Technology \nBoth platforms offer virtual paper trading accounts, which is helpful for those practicing investment strategies before deploying real money. Other similarities between eToro and Webull include payment for order flow (PFOF) and availability of fractional shares. For example, Webull’s payment for order flow averaged $0.01088, which was definitely on the high end of the brokers we evaluated. \nThe broker acknowledges that PFOF is the only reason it can offer a robust trading platform commission-free. Webull is attentive to best execution practices and monitors the platform's metrics monthly, reporting price improvement of $0.0019 on average for the time period evaluated. eToro is vague regarding its actual execution speeds and order routing, reporting a modest $0.00028 in PFOF for the period. \neToro attempts to provide traders with the best execution prices and results as is reasonably possible, according to the company.10 No specific data is offered to substantiate the results of the trading execution claims. The platform leans towards a social, copycat, and momentum model. The social news feed works similarly to the X (formerly Twitter) or Facebook feed, with top movers and CopyTrader portfolios highlighted while typical individual investment research and selection are minimized. \nWebull emphasizes transparency and achieving the best execution speeds and prices. Trades are routed based on quality of execution, not on payment for order flow. In the most recent data, orders of 100 to 499 shares are executed in 0.096 seconds, with a price improvement per share of $0.0050. The percentage of shares executed at or better than National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) is 98.96%.11 \nTrading Technology Verdict: Webull \nOverall, we found that Webull’s trading technology is better than eToro’s, and the trading features are more consistent with a serious investment brokerage platform. \nCosts \nNeither eToro nor Webull charges commissions to trade stocks, ETFs, or options, while eToro levies a 1% fee to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Margin fees are competitive at Webull at 9.24% for up to $25,000 and down in steps from there to 5.24% on amounts over $3 million.12 eToro doesn't advertise the use of margin trading very much and restricts its use.\nCosts Verdict: Tie \nBoth are essentially no-cost brokers, but it is worth remembering that Webull offers a greater number of assets. \nCompare Costs \nAccount and Research Amenities \nThe research capabilities at eToro are light in contrast with other investment apps. Users can access a basic detailed quote including fundamental data and lists of advancing and declining assets. The basic customizable charting includes tools and studies for those interested in technical indicators. There are no traditional screeners and limited information about individual assets. The eToro Club, which offers additional features to users with higher assets under management, offers a few financial media subscriptions for those with more than $50,000, but no actual research reports.13 \nAt Webull, the research amenities include detailed quotes, screeners, tools, and calculators. The charting features are vast, and the platform offers data for both fundamental and technical investors. With the addition of Webull 8.0, the tools for intermediate and even advanced traders are on the rise and include advanced customizable charting. \nAccount and Research Amenities Verdict: Webull \nHands down, the research features are superior at Webull in contrast with eToro. \nCompare Account and Research Amenities \nPortfolio Analysis \nNeither platform wins any portfolio analysis awards. Each platform lacks linking of external accounts or in-depth asset allocation or backtesting strategies. Users can view basic account information and quotes, including price charts. The portfolio analysis at eToro lags that of most competitor investment apps. Webull narrowly improves upon eToro and offers account performance, realized and unrealized gains and losses, internal rate of return, and margin data. \nPortfolio Analysis Verdict: Tie \nThese two platforms are essentially tied in this category as they both lack portfolio analysis tools provided by other brokers. \nEducation \nNeither of these two brokers is exceptional when it comes to education. The eToro Trading Academy delivers educational training in video and written formats. The content is divided between beginner and advanced. That said, advanced investors are unlikely to find the breadth of investments or research that they need at eToro. \nThe educational topics are not comprehensive. Investing subjects largely cover crypto, options, trading, and how to use the platform. Webull’s investor education is satisfactory with short courses and articles. The topics span stocks, ETFs, trading, and options. Users will also find several videos about how to navigate the Webull platform on the Learn menu. \nEducation Verdict: Tie \nThis category is a tie as well. Investors will find more extensive educational offerings on the major investment brokerage platforms. \nCustomer Service \neToro lacks phone customer service and relies on digital help tickets and the FAQ/help section for user questions. Platform usage help can be obtained via videos and articles at eToro as well. Webull provides phone service with live agents during business hours. Webull also offers email support and FAQs along with platform video and article guidance. \nCustomer Service Verdict: Webull \nWebull ekes out a lead in the customer service category, although wait times for phone contact can be long. \nSecurity \nBoth platforms offer two-factor authentication and biometric logins as well as Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance.1617 eToro also offers a digital wallet in which to store cryptocurrency. For additional security, Webull offers an extra passcode for trading access. Webull has excess SIPC insurance for larger account sizes. \nSecurity Verdict: Webull \nBoth platforms are secure, but Webull wins the category with additional SIPC insurance and trading security. It is important to remember that no insurance protects account holders from changes in asset values. Instead, SIPC policies protect against the failure of the brokerage holding your assets and cash. \nAccount Types \neToro only offers individual taxable cash accounts and options accounts, while Webull offers individual taxable cash and a margin account for those with more than $2,000 in assets.18 \nWebull users also have access to the standard retirement accounts: \nTraditional individual retirement account (IRA)\nRoth IRA\nRollover IRA\nWebull and eToro both lack the breadth of available accounts found at major brokerage firms like Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, E*TRADE, or Charles Schwab. \nAccount Types Verdict: Webull \nBetween eToro and Webull, Webull clearly prevails with margin, taxable, and retirement accounts. A joint brokerage account would elevate Webull’s standing even more among the popular investment apps. \nThe Bottom Line \nWebull and eToro are vastly different platforms, suitable for distinct investors. If you want to take a small amount of money to invest, follow other traders, and play at investing, then eToro works. Due to eToro’s emphasis on how other investors are trading, its opinions on various assets, the focus on momentum investing, and the minimal research information, we wouldn’t recommend eToro as your only investment app. New investors will not get a well-rounded, research-based investment education at eToro—nor will you get that at Webull, for that matter. Choosing stocks, ETFs, options, and crypto is a risk-return tradeoff and the social aspect at eToro may add to that risk by playing to the crowd-following impulses we all share. \nWebull is a better alternative for investors who want access to stocks, ETFs, and options. You’ll still need to look elsewhere for basic investment education, but its fundamental and technical trading features are quite good, and even rival some of the more well-known investment platforms. Most technical traders will find what they need at Webull because the overall platform user interface and charting capabilities are excellent. Webull stands out in the investment app arena by demonstrating an ongoing commitment to improving the platform. If you are looking for a streamlined investment experience, Webull is a nice balance of keeping to its investment app roots while embracing some of the best features of its larger competitors. \nHow We Picked the Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms \nProviding readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia.

  "text": "The Economics of Stamp Collecting\nMaybe you had a parent or grandparent who collected stamps or taught you about philately, the term for stamp collecting. \nStamp collecting began as a hobby shortly after the first postage stamp was issued in the United States in 1847.1 As stamps developed different values, the colorful squares from different locations like Hawaii and Madagascar were bought and sold for their collectible value. \nInterest in stamp collecting has declined in popularity in recent years. Today, philatelists are largely made up of baby boomers and investors. Retirees may have more time to devote to the hobby, but they may be reticent to invest in the most expensive, high-end stamps that attract investors. \nLearn more how investors approach buying stamps for their portfolio, how the economics of philately works, and more about current trends in stamp prices. \nKey Takeaways\nInvestors aim to earn a profit with buying and selling valuable stamps.\nPrices of stamp collections are declining due to recent trends of abundant supply and dwindling demand.\nThe global pandemic brought a resurgence of interest in stamp collecting.\nStamps are considered more illiquid assets because they typically take time to sell.\nIs Stamp Collecting a Losing Proposition? \nIn 1988, the American Philatelist Society had 57,815 members, according to the organization’s website. Today, it has less than half as many.2 People may be losing interest in stamp collecting for a number of reasons, including the fact that the value of many stamps are declining. \nThe rise of more efficient research tools like the internet has improved transparency surrounding buying and selling stamps, and has actually led to their devaluing. That’s in part because collectors discovered that many stamps weren’t as rare as originally thought. \nSeveral factors go into stamp valuation. They include the stamp’s image, its edges or perforations, the original denomination, the country of origin, and the history or backstory of the stamp. If a stamp has errors from printing, it may actually be more valuable because they were taken out of circulation, so they are more rare.3 \nOlder stamps may be more valuable if they are used, attached to an envelope with a special cancellation. Typically for a used stamp, the lighter the cancellation mark, the better.3 \nLong-Term Returns \nThe depressed price of collector stamps may be viewed by some as a buying opportunity for long-term returns. However, most hobbyists collect stamps for the love of storytelling and passion for the history behind the stamps. \nOne study published in the Journal of Financial Economics found that British collectible stamps from 1900 to 2008 had returns of 7.0% nominally, and 2.9% in real terms. These returns are generally higher than the average returns on bonds, but lower than returns on equities. It’s more on par with returns found with art. More rare and expensive stamps tend to yield greater returns for investors.4 \nThe most expensive stamp ever sold was a British Guyana One Cent Black-on-Magenta, which sold for $9.5 million in 2013, then again most recently in 2021 for $8.3 million.56\nStamps can be an excellent way to diversify an investment portfolio, but they are not a replacement for more traditional investments like the stock market or real estate to help you meet your financial goals. \nStamps are highly illiquid, meaning that they take time to convert into cash. That’s because if you want to sell a stamp, you may have to wait months or years before finding an interested buyer, depending on the demand for the particular stamp. Stamps are physical investments. You must store them properly or they can lose value. \nPandemic Resurgence in Stamp Collecting \nMany dealers reported a resurgence in stamp collecting after the global COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.7 Shuttered in their homes, people had more time to devote to their hobby. \nFor investing purposes, the value of stamps depends on demand, trends, origin, and condition of a stamp. Unused stamps are more valuable than used ones. However, if a stamp is very rare, it could be investment-grade even if its condition is less than perfect. \nWhat do you look for in an investment-worthy stamp?\nIf you are looking for a stamp to buy as an investment, look for stamps with undamaged, original glue or gum; unused stamps with gum; used stamps without gum; stamps that are rare; and stamps in superb, fine, or good condition.3\nDoes it make sense to invest in stamps?\nInvestment stamps can provide portfolio diversification. This is because they tend to be unaffected by the factors that determine the value of other assets. For example, their value is not influenced by the stock market or a real estate boom.\nHow do you invest in stamps?\nYou can either buy stamps on your own or buy a portfolio of stamps, such as five to seven rare stamps that you keep for a period, say five to 10 years. When the term is up, if the stamp’s value hasn’t increased, the selling company will refund your investment. On the other hand, if the value has increased, the seller takes a percentage of the profit. This type of investment can go up as well as down and is considered a capital-protected investment.\nThe Bottom Line \nIf you’re interested in investing in stamps, work with a reputable dealer while being aware of trends that could change a stamp’s value. Philately clubs also may include investors who may act as mentors. Keep in mind the fundamentals of what affects the value of a stamp, from its image to its perforation. \nBe aware that while these assets have fairly low volatility and tend to steadily increase in value, they can also decline in value depending on demand trends. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "My Company Is Offering Shares to Employees. Should I Buy Them?\nIf the company you work for is publicly traded, you may have the opportunity to buy shares of its stock, possibly at a substantial discount from what other investors must pay. Should you take up the offer? And, if so, how much money should you consider investing? The key to making those decisions is to try to approach them dispassionately, as you would with any other potential investment. This article can help you decide. \nKey Takeaways\nMany publicly traded companies offer employees an opportunity to buy shares of their stock.\nOften the shares are priced at a discount from what outsiders would have to pay.\nCompanies can offer shares as part of an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) or as an investment option in their 401(k) retirement plan.\nCompanies can also give shares of stock to their employees through an employee stock ownership program (ESOP) or as a matching contribution to the employee's 401(k).\nWhy Would a Company Offer Shares to Its Employees? \nCompanies offer shares to their employees for a variety of reasons. One is to build loyalty—an employee who is financially invested in a company may be emotionally invested in it as well and put in a greater effort toward making it successful. \nCompanies also offer shares, often at a reduced price, as an incentive in recruiting and retaining talented employees. From a company perspective, including stock as a part of an employee's pay package can also be more affordable than paying them entirely in cash. This is particularly common at startups, which usually need their cash for other purposes. \nMany companies also use stock options for much the same purposes. Unlike shares of stock, stock options simply give employees the right to buy shares at a set price at a certain point in the future. If the stock rises in value in the meantime, the employee can later \"exercise\" their options and buy the shares at the bargain price. Now that they own the actual shares, the employee can either sell them at a profit or hang onto them in hopes of further appreciation. \nHow Buying Shares of Your Company Works \nDepending on your company, you may have several different ways to buy shares. These can include: \nThrough an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) \nIn an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), the company sells shares directly to workers, often through automatic payroll deductions. In addition to not having to pay brokerage commissions, employees often get a discount on the shares, frequently on the order of 15%.1 Typically, there are no restrictions on when the employee can sell their shares. \nESPPs are similar to employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), which are another common way for employees to obtain shares of their company's stock. The key difference is that in ESPPs, the employee buys the shares with their own money, while in ESOPs, the company provides them free of charge, often as a form of retirement plan.2 \nThrough Your Company's Retirement Plan \nMany companies offer their own stock as one of the investment options in employees' 401(k) retirement plans. Some companies also use shares of their stock, rather than cash, when they match their workers' voluntary contributions to these plans.3\n$25,000\nMaximum value of employer stock you can purchase each year through most ESPPs.45\nPros and Cons of Buying Shares of Your Company \nAs with any kind of investment, company stock has some pluses and minuses. \nPros \nEasy way to save and invest: Many employers make it very simple to invest in their shares, such as through automatic payroll deductions.\nPossibility of a good discount: Companies often sell shares to employees at a discount from the regular market price.\nMore personal involvement with the company: Owning a piece of your company can make you feel more a part of it (as your employer may have intended). \nCons \nPotential lack of diversification: Given the ease with which you may be able to purchase shares—on top of the shares you might receive as an employee benefit—your company stock could become a disproportionately large portion of your portfolio.\nTies job risk to investment risk: Investing in the company you work for puts you at risk of losing both your job and your investment if the company hits hard times.\nIs It a Good Idea to Buy Shares in the Company You Work For? \nAs mentioned earlier, determining whether to invest in the company you work for is a decision that is best approached dispassionately, whether you love your company, hate it, or fall somewhere in between. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you decide. \nCan you afford it? Depending on your income and the various financial demands you face, you may not have a lot of spare cash for investment purposes at this stage of your life. So you'll want to be selective in the investments you choose and, sentiment aside, buying shares in your employer may not be your best option. \nWould you invest in this company if you didn't work for it? Here is what to consider: How has the company performed relative to others in its industry? Is its industry growing, relatively stable, or slowly dying? Do its managers articulate a strategic vision that makes sense or simply fall back on the latest buzzwords? Do you believe the company to be well-run based on what you've seen from the inside? \nWhat do professional investment analysts think? Aside from your own opinions, what do other, possibly more objective observers have to say? If you have a brokerage account, that firm may have research and recommendations regarding your company that are accessible online. You can also find information on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) website. \nIs any discount you're offered enough to make up for whatever reservations you might have? If you're on the fence about whether your company is a smart investment, a sizable discount from its current market price could be a deciding factor, especially if you expect to sell relatively soon. \nWill it throw your asset allocation out of whack? Owning too much stock—especially too much of any one stock—could mean taking on more risk than is appropriate for someone in your situation. This can be particularly important as you get closer to retirement. \nWould Buying Company Shares Increase My Career Possibilities Within That Company?\nProbably not. In a large company, higher-ups may pay little attention to who is or isn't buying shares or have no way of knowing. If you're in an executive position, however, there may be some expectation (subtle or otherwise) that you participate in the company's employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), if only to set an example for others.\nWhat Is Insider Trading?\nInsider trading is an illegal activity, in which company insiders (or outsiders they are in cahoots with) act on important information that's not available to the public to buy or sell shares of their stock. \nCan I Sell My Company's Shares Whenever I Want?\nThat depends on how you obtained them. If you bought your shares through an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), they're yours to sell as soon as you take possession of them. However, if you received them through an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), you may have to wait until a qualifying event occurs, such as retirement or leaving the company, before you can receive a distribution of your shares. Even then, distributions may occur in installments rather than a lump sum. Your company should clearly spell out its vesting schedule and distribution rules.\nHow Much Company Stock Is Too Much?\nAs a general rule, most financial planners and other experts say it's prudent to have no more than 10% of your portfolio in any one stock, including your employer's.6\nWhat's the Main Difference Between an ESPP and an ESOP?\nFrom an employee point of view, the principal difference between an ESPP and an ESOP is who pays for the shares. In an ESPP, the employee buys them. In an ESOP, the employer provides them free of charge.\nThe Bottom Line \nShares of stock in the company you work for can be a good investment if the company is well-run and appears to have a solid future. That's especially true if you're offered a substantial discount off the regular market price, as is often the case. However, it's also important to stay properly diversified and not load up on company stock simply because it's cheap or easy.\nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research.

  "text": "How to Invest in Uncertain Times\nEvery day it seems like the world is more interconnected. If you watch any financial television channel or read the news online, you are most likely aware of how events in one country seem to have an ever-increasing effect on other countries around the world. \nCertain aspects of globalization can have positive benefits, but when threats of a financial crisis, war, global recession, trade imbalances, etc. do occur, it often leads to the talk of moving money to safer investments and increasing government deficits. This rising uncertainty can confuse even the well-informed investor. \nKey Takeaways\nThere is always a level of risk and uncertainty when investing which is increased in times of wars, recessions, pandemics, and other negative occurrences.\nWhen hard times come, investors move their money out of equities to safer assets, such as precious metals, government bonds, and money-market instruments.\nThe move of investor capital from equities to safer assets causes the stock market to depreciate.\nUncertainty impacts the economy on both the micro and macro level: On the micro level it focuses on companies and individuals, while on the macro level it focuses on the overall economy, like global oil prices and the flight of capital.\nBeing well informed and adjusting your investment strategy as events change over time will allow you to invest wisely during uncertain times.\nDiversification is a key investment strategy that prevents significant losses if one area of your portfolio takes a serious hit.\nThe Impact of Uncertainty on Investing \nAny time you put money at risk in an attempt to profit, there is an inherent level of uncertainty. When new threats such as war or recession arise, the level of uncertainty increases significantly as companies can no longer accurately predict their future earnings. \nAs a result, institutional investors will reduce their holdings in stocks considered unsafe and move the funds to other asset classes like precious metals, government bonds, and money-market instruments. This sell-off, which occurs as large portfolios reposition themselves, can cause the stock market to depreciate. \nUncertainty is the inability to forecast future events. People can't predict the extent of a possible recession, when it's going to start/end, how much it will cost, or what companies will be able to make it through unscathed. \nMost companies normally predict sales and production trends for the investing public to follow assuming normal market conditions, but increasing uncertainty levels can make these numbers significantly inaccurate. \nMicro and Macro Risks \nUncertainty itself can affect the economy on both the micro and macro levels. Uncertainty on a micro-level centers around the effect on individual companies within an economy faced with the threat of war or recession, while uncertainty on a macro-level tends to look more at the economy as a whole. \nMicro Risks \nFrom a micro-level, company-specific viewpoint, uncertainty provides a major concern for those that produce consumer goods every day. For example, consumption may fall on the threat of a recession as individuals refrain from purchasing new cars, gadgets, and other non-essentials. \nThis uncertainty may force companies in certain sectors to lay off some of their employees to combat the impacts of lower sales. The level of uncertainty that surrounds a company's sales also extends into the stock market. Consequently, stock prices of companies that produce non-essential goods sometimes experience a sell-off when levels of uncertainty rise. \nMacro Risks \nOn a macro-level, uncertainty is magnified if the countries at war are major suppliers or consumers of goods. A good example is a country that supplies a large portion of the world's oil. Should this country go to war, uncertainty regarding the level of the world's oil reserves would grow. Because the demand for oil would be high and the supply uncertain, a country unable to produce enough oil within its own borders would be required to ensure that enough oil was stored to cover operations. As a result, the price of oil would increase. \nAnother macro-level event that affects companies and investors is the flight of capital and devaluation of exchange rates. When a country faces the threat of war or recession, its economy is considered uncertain. \nInvestors attempt to move their currency away from unstable sources to stable ones; the currency of a country under a threat of war may be sold and the currencies from countries without the threat are bought instead. The average investor probably would not do this, but the large institutional investors and currency futures traders would. These actions translate into a devaluation of exchange rates. \nInvesting Strategies for Uncertain Times \nWhen situations of heightened uncertainty arise, the best defense is to be as well-informed as possible. Keep updated by following news that impacts markets and researching individual companies. Analyze which sectors have more to gain and lose in a crisis, and decide on a long-term plan. \nInvesting in gold has been a popular strategy during hard economic times, primarily because gold has an intrinsic value.\nTimes of heightened uncertainty can lead to great opportunities for investors who position themselves to take advantage of it. Some investors might decide to go on the offensive and search for companies that provide goods or services that will lead to great returns when things turn around. It is difficult to commit capital during uncertain times, but it can often reap huge rewards in the long run. Those who want to mitigate uncertainty and risk might be content leaving their money where it is or perhaps moving it to safer securities. \nDiversification is always a key investing tactic and not only in times of uncertainty. Having your investments spread across a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and precious metals, helps soften the blow if one area depreciates quickly. \nFurthermore, investing in different regions and different sectors and industries also increases diversification. For example, if you had all of your investments in oil companies and oil prices took a dive because of an outbreak of war in the Middle East, you are at a significant risk of loss. Now, if you also had investments in the technology sector and renewable energy, your portfolio would not be impacted as much. \nThe Bottom Line \nRegardless of which strategy you decide to take (if any), you can't go wrong over the long term by keeping yourself well-informed and getting into a position to take advantage of prices when things reverse. Being able to keep on top of news and adjust your portfolio accordingly will help you to invest wisely during uncertain times. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Who Is Ray Dalio?\nRay Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, with around $130 billion in capital as of June 2022.1 After receiving a master of business administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School and beginning his career on Wall Street, Dalio started Bridgewater from his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment in 1975.2 \nDalio’s methods and principles—sometimes the subject of critiques but also widely emulated by other executives and organizations in the financial services sector and beyond—played a key role in growing Bridgewater into the financial behemoth that it is today. His philosophy is based on the notion that cause-and-effect relationships are the key to understanding complex realities. Dalio believes that studying how these relationships have shaped the past provides the key to making optimal decisions in the present and unlocking success in the future.2 \nKey Takeaways\nRay Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which grew to become the world’s largest hedge fund.\nDalio operates his business based on a series of established principles focused on cause-and-effect relationships and in-depth analysis of past phenomena.\nDalio’s philosophy and Bridgewater’s culture of “idea meritocracy” and “radical transparency” have been influential in the financial world and beyond.\nEarly Life and Education \nBorn in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, on Aug. 1, 1949, Raymond Thomas Dalio grew up in a middle-class neighborhood on Long Island.3 His journey from a normal childhood to become one of the world’s most notable investors began when he was just 12 years old and working as a caddy at a local golf course. The markets were booming, and stocks were a big topic of conversation on the course.2 \nDalio saved up some of the money he was making on the links to buy his first stock—opting for shares of Northeast Airlines because it was the only company he was familiar with that was trading for less than $5 per share. While he would later admit that this was not the most solid basis for choosing an investment, the shares tripled in value because of a buyout, and this initial stroke of luck was enough to transform the young Dalio into a lifelong investor.2 \nWhen he was in high school, although he remained engaged with the financial markets, Dalio showed little interest in academic pursuits. His C average in high school was just enough for him to be accepted into local Long Island University’s C.W. Post College on a probationary basis. However, because postsecondary education offered the chance to focus on finance—the subject that truly interested him—Dalio excelled in school. After graduating at the top of his class in 1971, Dalio headed directly for Harvard Business School, where he received his MBA in 1973.2 \nDuring his time as a student, Dalio was introduced to Transcendental Meditation, which he has credited as a key to his business success.2 However, the young Dalio was not all peace and tranquility. Shortly after leaving Harvard, he had his first Wall Street position at a firm called Shearson Hayden Stone, where he worked with agricultural commodities futures, providing guidance to cattle ranchers on how to hedge against risks to their business. On New Year’s Eve in 1974, an alcohol-fueled spat led Dalio to punch his supervisor in the face. Following his subsequent termination from Shearson, Dalio convinced some of the agricultural clients to hire him as a consultant, and he founded the firm Bridgewater Associates.4 \nBridgewater Associates \nDalio’s initial conception of the firm included a vision for trading commodities overseas—hence the reference to bridging waters in the name—but the company solidified its role as a consultancy. Bridgewater operated under Dalio’s belief that cause-and-effect relationships offered tools to predict every element of a business. When it came to agricultural commodities, he zeroed in on the number of animals and how much meat would come to market, as well as how much cattle eat and thus the amount of grain like corn and soy that would be consumed. Regressions of weather forecasts and yield allowed Dalio and Bridgewater to predict the time and quantity of goods coming to market in a way that other analysts would miss.5 \nThe superior level of analysis led Bridgewater to some early successes, but there were still some bumps in the road on the story of Bridgewater’s growth from its founding in Dalio’s small apartment to hedge-fund powerhouse. Based on the volatility seen in the markets at the end of the 1970s, Dalio publicly predicted a depression in 1982.6 \nBridgewater’s strategy is designed to function whether the markets are moving upward or downward, and it is adaptable to clients’ risk preferences.2\nHowever, stocks in the early 1980s instead entered a massive, long-term bull market, causing Dalio to lose almost everything. He was forced to dismiss his employees, sell his possessions, and even borrow money from his father to remain afloat. While the firm eventually recovered, the experience taught Dalio important lessons about avoiding overconfidence and learning from mistakes.6 \nThese lessons clearly paid off, with Bridgewater eventually becoming the world’s largest hedge fund and earning more money for its investors than any other hedge fund. The firm’s success has been driven by the incorporation of Dalio’s evidence-based investment principles into algorithms and computerized decision-making systems that are backtested and enhanced by human insights to determine the best investments in liquid stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. \nAmong his many accomplishments, Dalio is known for helping McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) bring the Chicken McNugget to the market. Dalio was working as a consultant for the fast-food giant, which was concerned about securing a source of chicken at a stable price before launching the product. Dalio also advised a chicken producer. By focusing on the chicken as a simple machine based on the feed it required, Dalio helped the chicken producer use corn and soy futures to lock in its costs, which allowed it to offer McDonald’s a favorable fixed price and enabled the launch of the bite-sized and dippable product known throughout the world today.7 \nThroughout Bridgewater’s years of growth, Dalio served as the firm’s chief executive officer (CEO), chief investment officer (CIO), and chairman. However, he has stepped down from those positions in recent years, transferring additional responsibilities to his colleagues and partners. In September 2022, Dalio completed his transition from his more formal leadership roles, but he will continue as a mentor to Bridgewater’s CIOs and other top-level managers, a member of the operating board, and a senior investor.2 \n$19.1 Billion\nRay Dalio’s net worth as of October 2022, according to the Forbes list of the world’s billionaires.8\nRay Dalio’s Principles \nDalio conducts his business based on a series of principles that he has written down, and which he firmly believes that everyone also should write down and use in their own decision-making processes. Recognizing the cause-and-effect relationships underlying complex realities is a key to success, and unlocking these relationships is the most effective way to guide trading and investing decisions. More specifically, Dalio attributes Bridgewater’s success to his adherence to the following principles, among others: \nIt is critical to learn consistently from the lessons of life, adapting to new realities and enhancing the capacity to manage reality.\nThe world—and the markets—work like a machine, with even the most complex realities resulting from cause-and-effect relationships.\nHistory tends to repeat itself. Although there may be variations, carefully studying the cause-and-effect relationships underlying past phenomena allows for comprehension of ongoing processes and development of strategies for responding to them.\nSuccess depends on adopting concrete principles, stress-testing them, and sticking to them.\nWorking together with others and establishing a positive group culture is another key to achieving goals.\nDealing with gaps in knowledge is even more important than leveraging knowledge.2\nRay Dalio believes that writing things down is a way of ensuring a thorough analysis. Starting early in the history of Bridgewater, Dalio began to share his ideas with clients in a publication known as Bridgewater Daily Observations. He also published a book in 2017 titled Principles: Life and Work, in which he details his philosophy.2 He also regularly posts videos to a YouTube channel.\nBeyond these principles, it is worth mentioning a couple of other ideas central to Dalio’s philosophy and the success of Bridgewater. The firm operates based on the notion of an “idea meritocracy.” In other words, the best ideas triumph, regardless of where they come from in the employee hierarchy. While everyone is entitled to participate in the conversation, idea meritocracy typically gives more weight to the opinions of those with more expertise in the subject at hand.2 \nAnother important concept for Dalio’s philosophy and Bridgewater’s culture is the idea of “radical transparency.” This involves recording and making available all meetings and interviews within the company, limiting the potential for office politics to devolve into unspoken animosity, covert disagreements, and conflicting agendas. In Dalio’s view, this radical transparency creates an environment of radical truthfulness, with openness and honesty as key ingredients in a team’s success.2 \nWhat is Ray Dalio famous for?\nRay Dalio is best known as the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which is the world’s largest hedge fund. Dalio founded the firm out of his apartment in 1975 and went on to serve as its chief executive officer (CEO), chief investment officer (CIO), and chairman.\nWhat is a hedge fund?\nA hedge fund is a type of alternative investment managed by professional fund managers who adopt a variety of strategies with the goal of achieving above-average returns. Hedge funds operate as limited partnerships of private investors, and because of the levels of risk involved, they often require a high minimum investment, making them more suitable for wealthy accredited investors.9\nWhat are Ray Dalio’s principles?\nDalio’s principles involve analyzing the markets like a machine in which complex realities stem from cause-and-effect relationships. He believes that studying many cases from the past provides a foundation for interpreting current conditions and making optimal decisions. Dalio also encourages a culture of “idea meritocracy,” in which the firm adopts the best idea regardless of hierarchy, and “radical transparency,” in which all meetings are recorded to ensure open and honest working relationships.2\nThe Bottom Line \nDalio is a famous investor and the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which he played a central role in growing into the world’s largest hedge fund. His principles of investing, which include focusing on cause-and-effect relationships and analyzing past cases, have had far-reaching influence in the financial world and beyond. Listed as one of the world’s most influential people by Time magazine in 2012, he has pledged to donate half of his wealth to charity during his lifetime.1011\nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Best Tech Stocks for November 2024\nThe Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) saw modest gains in October, up 2% as earnings season began. \nBelow is an analysis of the top tech stocks for November 2024, screened for best value, fastest growth, and most momentum. All stocks are listed on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.\nWe also excluded stocks with a price under $5, an average daily trading volume of less than 100,000, and a market cap of less than $300 million. \nAll data are current as of Oct. 28, 2024.\nBest-Value Tech Stocks \nValue investing is an investing strategy that holds that investors can identify stocks trading below their true value. At the time the market corrects this mispricing, these undervalued names may increase in value. Investors typically attempt to identify undervalued stocks using fundamental metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Typically, a lower P/E ratio signals an undervalued stock because it means the company is valued less than its fundamental value. These stocks may offer a stronger return after the market adjusts.1 \nConsensus Cloud Solutions, Inc.: Consensus Cloud Solutions provides a secure, cloud-based fax service that helps businesses, especially in healthcare, exchange and manage documents digitally. As part of a global shift towards artificial intelligence (AI), the company's Clarity AI solution automates and streamlines clinical documentation by converting unstructured documents, like scans and faxes, into structured, actionable data. It provides timely insights to clinicians, enhancing patient care and speeding up treatment.2\nHello Group, Inc.: Hello Group is a major player in China’s online social networking space, offering platforms like Momo and Tantan to help users form social and romantic connections based on location, interests, and activities. One reason behind the company’s low P/E ratio could be its lukewarm earnings report. In the second quarter of 2024, Hello Group's net revenues declined by 14.2% year-over-year, amid a decline in the number of paying users on both the Momo and Tantan apps compared to the same period last year.3\nWeibo Corporation: Weibo, a leading social media platform in China, is known for enabling real-time content creation, sharing, and distribution. In the second quarter of 2024, Weibo saw a slight 1% year-over-year revenue decrease, reaching $437.9 million, with advertising and marketing revenues down 3% but offset by a 15% increase in value-added services.4\nFastest-Growing Tech Stocks \nGrowth investors believe that increases in a company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) can be an indicator of a strong business that has the potential to increase in value. However, focusing on just one of these two metrics can give an incomplete picture of a company's growth potential. Circumstances unrelated to a company's fundamental business strength—such as tax law changes, mergers, or one-off gains—can skew these figures on their own. \nInvestopedia uses a dual-metric approach to reach a more balanced assessment of growth companies. We equally weight the latest year-over-year (YOY) percentage growth for both EPS and revenue. This approach aims to reduce the impact of those one-time anomalies to provide a better view of a company's true growth pattern and potential. Additionally, any companies with growth in excess of 1,000% are excluded as outliers. \nInterDigital, Inc.: InterDigital is a global research and development company specializing in wireless, video, and AI technologies. The company is currently developing AI and machine learning solutions to optimize wireless systems for 5G and creating deep learning-based video compression. The company is also exploring quantum computing to enhance future wireless network capabilities.5\nInnodata, Inc.: Innodata is a global data engineering company that provides AI-enabled software platforms and managed services for data annotation—the process of labeling or tagging data, such as text and images, to make it understandable for machine learning models and improve their prediction accuracy. For its second quarter of 2024, the company reported $32.6 million in revenue, a 66% increase year-over-year, and raised its guidance to 60% or more revenue growth for 2024.6\nApplied Digital Corporation: Applied Digital is a U.S.-based provider of advanced digital infrastructure, designed to support high-performance computing and AI-driven applications. For its first quarter 2025, Applied Digital announced revenue growth of 67% compared to first quarter 2024 and said it had secured a $160 million investment from institutional and accredited investors.7\nTech Stocks With the Most Momentum \nMomentum investing is a strategy aiming to capitalize on pre-existing market trends by focusing on stocks that have outpaced their peers or the broader market on returns. This investment principal holds that stocks on an upward path are likely to continue to outperform, as long as fundamental aspects of the business, industry, or sector do not change. \nMomentum investing is a common strategy applied to tech stocks because they regularly experience significant market disruptions. As companies launch new products, announce technological breakthroughs, and gain rapid popularity, investors have the potential to climb on board while these stocks are still ascending. \nHere are the tech stocks with the highest total return in the last 12 months. \nMicroStrategy Incorporated.: MicroStrategy is a company focused on accumulating Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset and developing Bitcoin-related applications. Recently, MicroStrategy announced an updated release of its AI-powered MicroStrategy ONE platform, which helps businesses leverage data insights effectively across all levels.8\nTeraWulf Inc.: TeraWulf owns and operates eco-friendly, vertically integrated bitcoin mining facilities in the U.S., primarily powered by nuclear and hydro energy. As of the second quarter 2024, the company had self-mined 669 bitcoins. 9\nAppLovin Corporation.: AppLovin Corporation provides a comprehensive software platform that helps businesses reach, monetize, and expand their global audiences within the advertising ecosystem. Additionally, it operates a portfolio of free-to-play mobile games through its studios, reaching a diverse global user base.10\nAdvantages of Tech Stocks \nGrowth potential \nTech stocks, particularly those in emerging areas, are known for experiencing some of the sharpest growth of any publicly traded company. Anticipating this, investors have sought periods in which the sector underperforms to invest heavily, as they expect significant growth over the long term. \nBut growth among tech stocks can vary dramatically. Many of the larger firms have limited growth potential because their market saturation and capitalization are already very high. Small-cap or penny tech stocks that experience technological breakthroughs or suddenly become incredibly popular may have periods of massive growth. Unusually, some of the biggest names in tech—including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)—have continued to grow at significant rates. \nAdvanced innovation \nTech trends are always changing, with companies aiming to capitalize on the latest technology and to guide and follow developments in innovation. This makes the sector primed for breakthroughs. One of the most recent major trends to sweep the tech sector has been AI-related technologies, which are increasingly integrated into companies across many industries and sectors. To the extent that some tech companies continue to play a role in making this possible, they stand to benefit from the ongoing AI trend. \nDisadvantages of Tech Stocks \nFluctuations in the tech sector \nTech stocks are known for their high volatility, where rapid technological changes and competitive pressures can lead to significant price fluctuations. They often carry high valuations based on growth expectations, making them susceptible to market corrections if they fail to meet these projections. Furthermore, regulatory challenges and geopolitical tensions can impact the sector, introducing additional risks and uncertainties for investors. \nTrends shift quickly \nThe sharp gains of many tech firms can prove tempting to investors who may not be well-versed in the technologies themselves. With rapid innovation characterizing the sector, trends and prospects shift very quickly as well. Investors who are unprepared for this pace or who lack knowledge of the fundamental strengths of different tech companies may find themselves following a trend that has already changed. \nAdvantages\nGrowth potential\nAdvanced innovation\nDisadvantages\nTech sector turbulence and rich valuations\nInvestors may be left behind with rapidly shifting trends\nThe Bottom Line \nThe tech sector's performance in 2024 is poised to be significantly influenced by advancements in AI, which is expected to drive long-term growth. The adoption of AI, along with ongoing digitization and cloud computing, offers promising opportunities, particularly for companies involved in semiconductor production and cloud software services.

  "text": "How New York Became the Center of American Finance\nNew York City is not only the financial capital of America but also of the world. While the city's financial dealings grew out of Wall Street, at the southern tip of Manhattan, large financial institutions and companies are now spread out throughout the city. Though New York's power in American finance is undisputed, it was not always this way. \nThe very first bank and stock exchange in the U.S. were actually established in Philadelphia, PA, and for a time, it was that city, and not New York, that stood as the pillar of the American financial world.1 \nDespite Philadelphia’s first-mover advantage, however, several geographic, economic, and political factors helped The Big Apple overtake the city of brotherly love to become the nation’s leading financial center. \nKey Takeaways\nNew York City became the financial epicenter of the world despite Philadelphia having a first-mover advantage.\nNew York gained ground on Philadelphia thanks to its dominance in commercial trade, in large part thanks to the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. \nNew York became the leader in American finance after the Second Bank of the United States failed to renew its charter in 1836. \nThe Philadelphia Story \nOne of the first signs of Philadelphia’s initial financial supremacy came with the establishment of the Bank of Pennsylvania in 1780 and its role in helping to finance the Revolutionary War.2 \nAs the nation’s largest city and acting capital during the last decade of the 18th century, it would become the location for the nation’s first federally chartered bank—the First Bank of the United States. Acting as a de facto central bank, it established Philadelphia as the initial center of American finance.3 \nThe failure of the First Bank to renew its charter in 1811 for political reasons did not disrupt this supremacy, as financial instability following the War of 1812 would help to bring about the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States in 1816, also located in Philadelphia.4 \nAs the nation’s only federally chartered bank—and given the special privileges that came with it—the bank exerted its power and influence over the rest of the nation’s state-chartered banks, which was notable in the history of U.S. banking regulation.4 \nPhiladelphia’s stock exchange further illustrated its place as the leading financial center. Indeed, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, established in 1790, is older than the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and even as late as 1815, London banks looked to Philadelphia rather than New York to buy American securities.1 \nTurning Points \nRealizing the dominance of Philadelphia’s security exchange market, New York decided to formalize its exchange by establishing the New York Stock and Exchange Board in 1817, which later became the NYSE. With a new exchange and home to more banks than its southern competitor, New York looked to lure investors away from Philadelphia.5 \nBy this time, New York had already surpassed Philadelphia as the nation’s leader in commercial trade. It was a top coastal trade city by 1789, overtaking Philadelphia in the value of imports in 1796, and in the value of exports in the following year. While New York’s superiority in commercial trade was clearly evident by 1815, it wasn't until the Erie Canal was completed in 1825 that New York's ascendancy became clear.6 \nGeographical Advantage \nNew York’s supremacy in trade has a lot to do with geographical factors, but it was also helped by many more contingent developments. Not only was New York a central location for inbound European merchants, but its ports proved to be much more convenient than either Philadelphia’s or Boston’s. Being deeper, the Hudson River proved to be much more navigable and less prone to freezing over than both the Delaware River and the Charles River. \nNew York’s geographical advantage was supplemented by the construction of the Erie Canal (1817–1825) and the establishment of Black Ball Lines in 1818. While the Erie Canal connected the Hudson River to the Great Lakes and consequently to the fastest-growing parts of America west of the Appalachian Mountains, the Black Ball Line provided the first-ever regularly scheduled transatlantic passenger service.78 \nBoth the Canal and the Line helped to solidify New York’s place as America’s center of commercial trade and central transportation hub. \nAs the first port of entry for many immigrants, New York became a convenient place for them to settle, helping stimulate an unstoppable rise in the city’s population that would grow to be 10% larger than Philadelphia’s by 1820 and as much as twice as large by 1860. The flow of immigrants also helped to increase manufacturing and commercial activity even further.9 \nThe largest bank in the U.S. by total assets is JPMorgan Chase, which is headquartered in New York City.10\nThe Adventurous Spirit \nThese new immigrants also brought with them a more adventurous risk-taking spirit that stood in contrast to the more cautious nature of Philadelphia’s Quaker heritage. As a result, New York quickly developed a reputation for being a city of innovative business enterprise with an entrepreneurial ethos that lent itself to speculative investment behavior. \nSpeculation further enhanced the voluminous trade in New York’s securities markets by keeping them awash with liquidity. \nIn order to finance the increasing amount of stock trading in New York, a market for call loans developed. Using securities as collateral, stock traders could borrow money from the banks to be used for further speculative investments. This behavior proved mutually beneficial for New York’s banks, and its stock market as the banks earned interest off of the loans while the borrowed money allowed for further securities trading. \nNew York Gains the Upper Hand \nBy the 1830s, having become the nation’s dominant commercial center, Wall Street was now keeping the major deposit balances of all of America’s banks. The only thing really keeping New York from claiming the title of the nation’s leading financial center was the existence of the Philadelphia-located Second Bank of the United States, whose charter was set to expire in 1836.4 \nWhat had become extremely irritating to Wall Street bankers was the fact that New York was the main source of Federal Customs receipts, but rather than being deposited in New York banks, they were deposited at the Second Bank. \nWhile then-President Andrew Jackson had his own reasons for being antagonistic towards the Second Bank, the Wall Street bankers’ interests were given a voice through Martin Van Buren, an influential New Yorker who became Jackson’s advisor. \nRegardless of the precise motives, the Second Bank of the United States failed to renew its charter in 1836, essentially determining New York’s fate as the center of American finance. This fate would be further strengthened by the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864, which would put New York at the top of a hierarchical banking structure.1112 \nThe 1864 version of the act stipulated that all national banks must maintain 15% reserves of lawful money in New York.13 \nWhy Is New York the Economic Capital of the World?\nNew York is the economic capital of the world because many of the largest companies in the world, specifically financial institutions, are headquartered there. Also, New York has the largest and the second-largest stock markets in the world. These markets are the center of global financial markets and include some of the largest corporations in the world.\nWhat Is the Financial Capital of Europe?\nThe financial capital of Europe is London. It contains large stock markets, banks, and other financial institutions. Much of the financial business done in Europe is done in or through London. Even after Brexit, London remains the foremost financial center in Europe.\nWhat Is the Largest Stock Market in the World?\nThe largest stock market in the world by market capitalization is the New York Stock Exchange. As of 2023, it had a market cap of $25.24 trillion.14\nThe Bottom Line \nDespite being home to the nation’s first bank and stock exchange, Philadelphia’s initial advantages would not be enough for it to maintain its financial dominance over New York City’s growing influence. By utilizing its unique geographical features, New York was able to overtake Philadelphia as the nation’s transportation and immigration hub. \nFrom there, New York quickly surpassed its southern competitor in commercial trade and finally gained American financial supremacy—a role that it maintains to this day.",

  "text": "Interactive Brokers vs. Webull 2024\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR) and Webull are both online trading platforms, but that’s where the similarities end. Founded by Thomas Peterffy in 1978, IBKR has grown into a massive global investment company serving intermediate to professional investors.1 Webull was founded in 2017 by Wang Anquan, a former Alibaba Group employee, as a low-cost trading website and mobile app.2 \nBoth IBKR and Webull are self-directed platforms for trading stocks, ETFs, futures, commodities, cryptocurrency, and options, but IBKR also offers bonds, mutual funds, forex, event contracts, warrants, and scores of managed portfolios. Moreover, U.S. and international traders can access a wide range of global investment markets at IBKR. While beginners and intermediate investors may be satisfied with Webull, all levels of traders, investors, and professionals will be well served by IBKR’s deep offerings. \nIBKR’s Lite and Pro tiers ensure there is a plan for beginners through professionals. Interactive Brokers and Webull have also made significant platform changes in recent years, with Webull putting crypto trading in a separate app and adding futures and IBKR making large upgrades to its user experience across its desktop and mobile platforms. We will dissect these two trading platforms to help you decide which one is a better fit for your portfolio needs. \nAccount Minimum: $0.00 \nFees: $0.00 commissions for equities/ETFs available on IBKR’s TWS Lite, or low costs scaled by volume for active traders that want access to advanced functionality such as order routing. $0.65 per contract for options on TWS Lite; that is also the base rate for TWS Pro users, with scaled rates based on volume. $0.85 per contract for futures, also scales with volume for TWS Pro users. 0.12%-0.18% on cryptocurrency trades depending on volume with a minimum $1.75 fee per trade. \nAccount Minimum: $0 \nFees: $0 commissions for stock, ETF, and options \nUsability \nComparing the usability of Webull and Interactive Brokers is similar to the contest between a Honda and a Mercedes. While both platforms offer good usability, their clients are of distinct camps. Newer investors and those seeking a streamlined desktop workstation and a well-designed mobile app for stock, ETFs, and options will find what they need at Webull. The mobile and desktop versions are similar, with easy access to the main features from the home screen. The home page user experience gives you a direct path to stock research, screening, trading, accounts, transfers, and more. \nInteractive Brokers is a high-end investment platform where you can access all asset classes, global markets, multiple trading platforms, and resources for beginners through professional investors. Given the breadth of the flagship platform, the user experience at IBKR is not as seamless as at Webull. Yet, despite its size, IBKR has made excellent progress in facilitating easier platform navigation. In 2024, IBKR also launched IBKR Desktop, which offers a more streamlined experience combined with the most popular trading features of Trader Workstation (TWS).3 Users of the downloadable desktop, web, and mobile versions will find similar functionality. At IBKR, you can trade any asset class on any platform, with access to data, charting, research, trading, news, and more. \nUsability Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nIBKR is still a trader's platform, but Webull had a slight edge in the simplicity of navigation. IBKR Desktop addresses that, If you want the breadth of IBKR products and markets, however, the usability via Trader Workstation is good even though there is a bit of a learning curve. \nTrade Experience \nDesktop Experience \nIBKR has two comprehensive trading platforms, the desktop client portal and the downloadable Trader Workstation (TWS), as well as the new IBKR Desktop for a more streamlined experience. The client portal and IBKR Desktop are suitable for all but the most sophisticated investors. You can check your account; place trades; view quotes, news, and research; and access advanced charting. \nBoth have more customization features than many other competing brokers's full desktop platforms. The powerhouse downloadable Trader Workstation (TWS) is for active professional traders and investors. The customizable TWS provides more than 100 order types and gives you all that you need in terms of fundamental and technical charting and portfolio management tools.4 You can rapidly place orders using hotkeys, trade directly from the chart, stage orders for later execution, manage risk, and access a staggering range of tradable assets across the globe. \nWebull, for its part, offers a customizable trading platform for stocks, ETFs, and options, and is suitable for casual through intermediate traders. The Webull workstation has customizable templates for stocks, ETFs, options, and day trading. The widget structure enables easy customization. The widgets contain different information, such as news, fundamentals, options, and so on. The advanced order screen includes contingency trading and trades directly from a chart. Webull has more features on its desktop than its WebTrade online platform, and the assets are more limited as well. \nDesktop Trade Experience Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nWebull can work for beginners and even intermediate traders, but IBKR, the winner of our best charting platform for day traders and best online broker for advanced traders, offers an unmatched array of tools for sophisticated investors. \nMobile Experience \nInteractive Brokers offers several mobile apps: IBKR Mobile, GlobalTrader, and Impact. The IBKR Mobile app is nearly identical to the computer-based platforms, although advanced users will find the broadest functionality on the Trader Workstation. In a recent revamp, BKR added more dashboards and bundled some of the more popular tools to make navigation easier. The Impact app enables ESG investors to screen for companies that meet specific criteria. Global traders in the U.S. and abroad can access 90-plus stock exchanges to trade in local currency using the GlobalTrader app.5 \nWebull recently reworked its mobile app to provide users with another approach to trading with Webull Lite. Its original mode offers all the charting, data, and technical resources, while the Lite version is simplified to just the trading essentials.6 In the full mode, users can access the smart trading tools, including more than 50 technical indicators and 19 charting tools.7 \nMobile Trade Experience Verdict: Tie \nWe found the Webull app easier to use than the IBKR mobile app, but the difference in the size of the platforms contributes to the complexities that affect IBKR’s app functionality. The GlobalTrader app is more streamlined than Webull and clearly aimed at newer investors. Both brokers have excellent apps, so we were unable to pick a clear winner here. \nRange of Offerings \nNew & Notable\nOn March 11, 2024, Webull announced its plans to expand into commodities and futures trading, ahead of a planned listing later in the year. The new offerings will focus on highly liquid futures markets with features including market, limit, stop market, and stop-limit orders. Webull said customers will also gain exposure to underlying asset classes such as commodities, currencies, and indexes.8\nHands down, IBKR is the winner, with access to all the important asset classes and more markets than most investors can reasonably trade. Beyond the basic stocks, ETFs, and options, you’ll find bonds, futures, forex, cryptocurrency, mutual funds, warrants, hedge funds, spot gold, events contracts, and scores of managed portfolios at IBKR. Webull users can trade U.S.-listed stocks, including over-the-counter issues, ETFs, futures, and options.9 \nRange of Offerings Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nWebull doesn't have a bad selection by any means, but its range of offerings simply cannot match Interactive Brokers’ industry-leading reach. \nCompare Range of Offerings \nOrder Types \nIn keeping with Webull’s scope, users can trade the typical order types, including market, limit, stop, stop limit, and trailing stops. Conditional orders like one-cancel-the-other and one-triggers-the-other are also available.10 Here again, Webull is not weak, but it is simply outmatched. At IBKR, users can access more than 100 order types and algos on the Trader Workstation.11 Traders can set up order cascades that set the parameters to enter and exit trades without having to actively monitor positions if they so choose. \nOrder Types Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nThe vast number of available order types makes IBKR the best pick for intermediate through professional investors and active traders. \nTrading Technology \nPro traders will appreciate IBKR’s SmartRouting, which automatically transmits the best available prices. TWS users can select their preferred stock and options smart routing strategies for non-marketable orders. Traders benefit from advanced technologies to further reduce trading costs and improve efficiency. IBKR reported a net price improvement per share of $0.0108 and reports accepting around $0.0020 per share in payment on order flow (PFOF) on the IBKR Lite side. IBKR Pro users barely see any PFOF at all because of the smart routing. In our analysis, we found the PFOF to be much lower than reported. This just confirms that price improvement and speed are the key priorities of the routing process. \nWebull's trading technology is basic, although it suffices and includes a net price improvement of 0.0050 a share on a 100-499 order size.12 Unlike IBKR, there’s no smart order routing, trading automation, or ways to route your own orders at Webull. Webull also sees significantly more payment for order flow, although the company is quite open about the fact that it is how the platform is offered for free. The volume of money coming in through PFOF is higher than IBKR, which is notable because of the difference in size. Webull's PFOF was $0.0202 per share in the period analyzed. That is many times what IBKR collects. \nTrading Technology Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nThere is no comparison between the trading technology at IBKR and Webull. IBKR is designed for sophisticated traders and offers substantially more order and trading technology breadth. \nCosts \nThe cost comparison between Interactive Brokers and Webull is again complicated by the difference in the size of each trading platform’s offering. IBKR’s pricing is complex, especially for Pro account holders. There are three types of equity commissions for Pro traders: fixed per-share of $0.005 with a $1.00 minimum and 1% of trade maximum.13 Tiered per-share pricing depends upon your monthly order activity. \nCompounding this, Interactive Brokers serves many countries outside the U.S. and all of them have some manner of regionalized pricing. IBKR Lite users receive commission-free equity and ETF trades, similar to most brokers today, including Webull. Users of IBKR Lite receive lower interest on cash balances and pay higher interest rates on margin borrowing. IBKR is also our best broker for low margin rates, with rates starting at 7.33% (6.33% for IBKR Pro users). Webull charges 9.24% up to $25,000 and 8.24% up to $100,000.1415 \nCosts Verdict: Webull \nWebull’s fee-free trading for stocks, ETFs, and listed options is a boon for fee-conscious investors. If trading cost is a priority, then Webull wins the category. But the limited number of products at Webull versus IBKR means that advanced traders in various assets will find a better overall deal at IBKR. \nCompare Costs \nAccount and Research Amenities \nIn the research category, we’re again confronted with the distinction between Interactive Brokers and Webull’s scope. IBKR’s research offerings are vast and include robust screeners and trading idea generators for stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, options, and fixed-income products. The tools include options, margin, order quantity, interest, and financing calculators. There is extensive third-party research available for free and with subscriptions. The research amenities border on overwhelming, but they are also extremely valuable in guiding your trading. IBKR is also always expanding this list of amenities. \nWebull’s research includes a stock screener. That’s pretty much it. The stock screener is not as robust as those of larger brokers, but it does allow you to filter by financial information and some preset indicators. The Webull charting capabilities should work for the majority of average traders. \nAccount and Research Amenities Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nWhen it comes to research, IBKR is the clear winner. Without tools, calculators, or third-party research, Webull falls substantially behind IBKR. \nCompare Account and Research Amenities \nPortfolio Analysis \nThe high-level IBKR portfolio analysis tool serves beginners to institutional investors. The free portfolio analysis tool, which is available to the public, has continued to see major upgrades. IBKR account holders can access advanced features and real-time updates. \nAfter linking your financial accounts, you’ll receive in-depth analysis of your entire financial picture, including investment portfolio checkup, total returns, risk measures, and allocations by geography, asset class, and sector. You can also access retirement analysis through this same PortfolioAnalyst tool. There is also a new dashboard that allows you to see real-time analysis of performance across accounts with different charts and tools. \nWebull falls short on portfolio analysis, offering just the basics. Users have access to account performance details, including realized and unrealized gains or losses as well as capital gains or losses. You’ll also have access to internal rate of return or IRR data. \nPortfolio Analysis Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nIBKR is better suited for those with more substantial investment portfolios who need comprehensive portfolio analysis tools. \nEducation \nThose seeking both a basic and an in-depth investment education will be fulfilled at IBKR. Its vast education resources are available to customers and the public. These range from short videos to multi-language tutorials, daily webinars, and events. IBKR reworked its education offerings in 2023, bringing its well-established Traders Academy into IBKR Campus. This website provides beginner, intermediate, and advanced online courses. The topics range from rudimentary introductions to stocks, indexes, and trading to advanced option strategies and margin.16 \nWebull’s investor education is suitable for the typical Webull customer. The short courses include the basics about stocks, ETFs, trading, and options. The learning portal includes several explainer videos and information about how to navigate the platform.17 \nEducation Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nThe Webull educational offerings are a good start, but lack the depth and breadth of those available at IBKR. Regardless of where you open an account, the IBKR education tools are comprehensive and worth a look. \nCustomer Service \nIBKR is improving its customer service. For ready assistance, the artificial intelligence IBot is available from most screens. IBKR also provides phone support 24 hours a day and has a callback service. Live agent online chat is also accessible from within the trading platform or website.18 Additionally, the FAQ section is well-organized. \nWebull offers phone customer service during trading hours and an extensive FAQ section. Wait times are known to be long at Webull. \nCustomer Service Verdict: Interactive Brokers \nIn general, IBKR is easier to access via customer service and offers more expansive phone hours and chat features. \nSecurity \nSecurity protocols and asset protection at IBKR go above and beyond basic industry standards. Beyond the standard $500,000 Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage, excess SIPC coverage at IBKR provides up to an additional $30 million with a cash sub-limit of $900,000, subject to an aggregate limit of $150 million.19 Webull also offers industry-beating security protocols, including a discrete six-digit passcode for trading access. Webull's additional SIPC insurance covers account holders up to $37.5 million including $900,000 in cash.20 \nSecurity Verdict: Tie \nThe security features at both Webull and IBKR are both excellent. Investors can be comfortable that their data will be protected at either firm. The insurance does not protect investors from losses due to normal market fluctuations but from corporate malfeasance and bankruptcy. \nThe Bottom Line \nBoth IBKR and Webull are good investment platforms. In prior years, the larger and older IBKR ran the table for many of our top-rated categories like best broker for advanced options traders, day trading, and international trading. More recently, Webull has received acknowledgment for costs, including best low-cost options broker and best low-cost day trading app. \nThe winner of the contest between Interactive Brokers and Webull comes down to your investment needs. Active investors seeking the widest range of investment assets all under one roof will choose IBKR. Access to bonds, mutual funds, futures, forex, and international trading is rarely found within one company. The range of managed portfolios and international trading further distinguish IBKR. \nFinally, the TWS platform competes head-to-head with any professional trading software. It is hard to beat Interactive Brokers in its totality. IBKR responds to the breadth of features with many platform-related guides, tutorials, videos, and customer service help to make its platforms more accessible. The recent introduction of IBKR Desktop also provides another option for investors who want more but aren't prepared to take on Trader Workstation in full. \nIf you don’t need all the bells and whistles of IBKR, however, and are seeking a streamlined trading platform with low fees, then Webull is a solid choice. The IBKR Lite plan is appropriate for most investors, with affordable fixed pricing for options, futures, and mutual funds, along with commission-free stock and ETF trading. Our main caution with Webull is that beginners might need to visit other sources to get a well-rounded investment education. We do, of course, note the PFOF dependence, but Webull has been transparent on this count and gamification is currently kept to a minimum. \nHow We Picked the Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms \nProviding readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia.

  "text": "Talking to Your Clients About Crypto Taxes: A Guide for Financial Advisors\nCryptocurrencies, like any other investment, are subject to taxation. However, tax rules that concern cryptocurrencies can be harder to navigate than those for other asset classes. \nGiven the novelty of the technology, many investors don’t fully understand how cryptocurrency taxes should be calculated and filed. Some investors might not even be aware that taxes should be reported. New tax laws and regulations are constantly being introduced to keep up with recent developments in the technology. \nInformed discussions can help investors cut to the chase and stay on top of these requirements. Here’s how financial advisors can prepare for conversations about crypto taxes with clients. \nKey Takeaways\nMany clients are unprepared to handle taxes on their crypto investments.\nTax rules that concern cryptocurrencies can be harder to navigate than those for other asset classes.\nHaving discussions ahead of time with a financial advisor can limit unnecessary headaches.\nIn the U.S., cryptocurrencies are treated as property and taxed as investment income, ordinary income, gifts, or donations at the state and federal levels.\nUnderstanding Cryptocurrency Taxes \nIn the United States, cryptocurrencies are treated as property and taxed as investment income, ordinary income, gifts, or donations for tax purposes at the state and federal levels.1 Tax laws vary by state and territory but are the same for individuals, corporations, and funds federally. \nThe cryptocurrency can be anything from bitcoin or ether to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) products. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the federal tax agency that handles taxes across all U.S. states and territories. \nInvestment income: Profits from crypto that is bought and later sold, usually on a crypto exchange, are considered income from an investment. Returns are taxed at your normal income tax rate for short-term gains (held less than one year) or long-term capital gains or losses (held more than one year), similar to profits from stock trades.\nOrdinary income: Crypto is considered ordinary or non-investment income when it is not purchased by the holder and is received as a form of payment or passive income, usually from interest-bearing accounts, an employer, staking, mining, or a cryptocurrency airdrop.\nGift: Crypto is considered a gift if it was given for free and wasn’t a payment, loan, or interest.\nDonation: Crypto donations are tax-deductible for donors. Recipients owe gift taxes.2\nFederally, long-term capital gains are taxed according to a sliding scale that depends on income level and is capped at a fixed percentage. Tax rates for short-term capital gains and ordinary income are equal to the tax rate of the annual income tax bracket corresponding to the tax filing status of an individual, a business, or an investment fund.3 \nTax-registered entities such as corporations, nonprofits, and limited partnerships pay different tax rates, including variations between S corporations (S corps), limited liability companies (LLCs), and other corporate structures.4 Ordinary income may include self-employment taxes if the crypto was paid as a wage.56 \nGifts worth less than a certain amount don’t carry federal tax implications and don’t need to be reported to the IRS. After they hit that limit, gift taxes apply and increase based on their taxable value up to 40%.7 Virtual currency received as a gift is not considered income until it is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of.8 \nDonations made in crypto can be deducted from gross income to lower taxable income, similar to standard and itemized tax deductions.9 \nMany investors might not know that quarterly estimated taxes must be filed if they expect to owe more than $1,000 in crypto taxes on their annual federal tax return.10\nDiscussing Crypto Taxes With Clients \nDiscussing cryptocurrency taxes with clients is important to minimize their tax liabilities for financial planning purposes and to avoid potential consequences from tax authorities. \nGeneral Points \nFailing to file returns and pay the correct amount of taxes could result in time-consuming audits and stiff penalties from financial regulators.1112 Investors may be tax-advantaged by moving to other states and territories, trading in certain volumes and frequencies, or calculating taxes with reference prices that present less capital gains taxes.13 \nThe IRS and some states ask about cryptocurrencies on tax forms and have dedicated personnel to figure out if taxes aren’t reported.14 Popular crypto exchanges—like Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini—share data on customers who earn above a certain threshold of cryptocurrency income in a taxable year.151617 Cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis companies—like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and TRM Labs—are contracted to trace unreported transaction activity and correlate it with known identities.18 \nState and Federal Tax Overview \nSome states or territories don't impose income taxes or capital gains taxes.1920 Other states or territories don't collect personal taxes—but do levy corporate taxes—and could offer generous tax breaks and incentives for digital assets.2122 \nFederally, cryptocurrencies sold after one year are taxed at long-term capital gains rates. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as income. What's more, every trade is taxed no matter the size of the transaction, whether cashing out from crypto to fiat currency or converting between different tokens.23 \nThe Topic of Cost Basis \nTaxes on crypto holdings recognized as investment income—or when the crypto transaction functionally becomes a trade—are calculated using a cost basis. \nThe IRS views cryptocurrency as property, so it is accounted for as a capital asset for tax purposes. If it is stored as inventory for ordinary business uses, it could be accounted for using accounting methods like FIFO and LIFO. Most long-term investors will have to use a cost basis for tax purposes.24\nA capital loss is booked if the cost basis of the asset—or the purchase price plus transaction fees, commissions, and acquisition costs—is higher than the sale price it sold for, less transaction fees, commissions, and acquisition costs. A capital gain is booked if the sale price is higher than the cost basis.25 \nThus, in some circumstances: \nActive investors could owe more in federal taxes than passive investors.\nClients in higher federal income tax brackets could pay less taxes on crypto held longer than 12 months.\nTaxpayers who engage in crypto tax-loss harvesting and sell during the downturn could book capital losses instead of capital gains to offset tax liabilities.\nResidents of certain states or territories could pay next to nothing on crypto taxes, an advantage for investors who make regular transactions.\nAlaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming don’t have income or capital gains taxes.19 Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory that doesn’t require capital gains or federal taxes.2627\nPreparing for the Crypto Taxes Conversation \nUnderstand the Advice You Can Offer \nIt’s important to be aware of the distinction between tax planning and tax advice. Financial advisors who are not licensed to prepare tax returns can work with clients for tax planning purposes. For example, you might recommend that clients set aside enough money to cover taxes or inform them of their likely tax rate. \nBut you should avoid offering more direct, specific tax advice. Tax advisors, on the other hand, are licensed to prepare tax returns and can offer more specific advice about which tax forms clients must file or what they are required to report. \nIf a financial advisor offers tax advice without the necessary permissions or licenses and gives a client faulty advice, it could open them and their firm up to legal liability. \nTherefore, when it comes to discussing crypto taxes—or any taxes—with clients, bear in mind the kind of advice or information that you’re able to offer clients and that which should be left to tax professionals instead. You can recommend clients meet with a tax advisor for specific tax advice. \nGather Information \nAccordingly, to prepare for your conversation with a client, aim to understand what cryptocurrencies they’ve held and how they’ve interacted with them. Without knowing how the assets were obtained and valued, you can’t calculate how much they owe in taxes or distinguish if they’re taxed as investment income, ordinary income, gifts, or donations. \nClarify for clients that those working with a tax advisor will need to compile records indicating: \nThe exact times, days, and prices when the crypto assets were received, bought, or sold.\nWhere they bought the crypto from or how they acquired it.\nWhat transaction fees, commissions, and acquisition costs were charged (which will affect the cost basis of their returns).\nThese records can usually be downloaded from the crypto exchange or platform where the trades or transfers happened.28 \nWhile it would be beyond the scope of expertise of a typical financial advisor, a tax advisor should find out what tax forms the client is required to file. That includes confirming their state or territory of residence. As mentioned, taxes differ across each state or territory and involve unique forms. Federal tax forms are standardized across the U.S., regardless of state or territory. \nReview Financial Objectives \nFor crypto assets that clients continue to hold and haven’t yet liquidated, gauge your client’s financial goals and contingencies. Your advice will differ if they are moving to another state or territory shortly or prefer to sell all their crypto this year instead of holding them for another decade before making changes. Some clients could be short on cash and need to free up wealth soon. Others might be well-positioned to have longer investment horizons.\nBasic Calculations for Crypto Taxes \nBe aware that there are several mathematical formulas and concepts that cryptocurrency owners in the U.S. must understand if they want to calculate their cryptocurrency taxes. These relate to cost basis, sale price, capital gains, and losses.\nCost Basis \nThe cost basis is the initial value paid to buy a token or the value at which the token was received (price multiplied by the number of units), plus any entry and acquisition costs, which could include transaction and commission fees.28 \nThe cost basis is essential for calculating the value of crypto assets of any tax distinction, including investment income, non-investment income, gifts, and donations. Crypto investors tend to deal with various cost bases due to characteristic market volatility and fluctuating transaction fees. \nSale Price \nThe sale price is the final value at which a token is liquidated for cash or swapped for another crypto (price times number of units), minus exit and selling costs, which could include transaction and commission fees. \nThe sale price comes into play only when capital gains or losses need to be calculated—or, in other words, when the crypto is taxed as investment income. \nCapital Gains and Losses \nCapital gains or losses apply only to cryptocurrencies that are part of discretionary trades taxed as investment income, when a crypto is bought and sold for cash, and when it is converted between two different assets.2930 \nThe capital gain or loss is the sale price minus the cost basis of a traded position. It is also referred to as return on investment (ROI).3 \nCommunicating Complex Concepts \nThe topic of taxation is filled with complex subjects that you or your clients' tax advisors should break down clearly. That way, those investing in crypto won't need to clarify the same issues repeatedly and can make judgment calls that will benefit them the most over time. \nStarting small could lay the groundwork. You can help educate clients on basic concepts. Then, work your way up to more advanced concepts or advise them to contact their tax advisor. \nStart With Some Essentials \nOffering examples with hypothetical numbers can be a good way to begin to illustrate how a tax subject works. For instance, you can say, “If someone bought $10,000 in Bitcoin and sold it for $15,000, they have to pay either income or capital gains taxes on that $5,000,” to help a client understand the concept of capital gains. \nFrom there, the examples can be tailored to a client’s particular tax situation. Numbers can be adjusted to reflect specific crypto holding amounts. Calculations can be drawn out with the assistance of visual aids and software programs, such as drawing boards, educational videos, and tax calculators. \nClients may find tax forms intimidating and need a tax expert to distill them. Walking through the tax forms step by step, along with the state, territory, or federal tax agency’s corresponding instructions, could eliminate confusion that clients will likely have when they try to fill them out. \nThe more complicated examples demanding demonstrative teaching aids will likely involve explaining how to calculate capital gains or losses across multiple crypto assets and multiple tax distinctions, such as investment and ordinary income. \nHere are some examples to illustrate some of these advanced concepts: \nMultiple Tax Distinctions \nA crypto gift of $1,000 of bitcoin would incur a taxable capital gain of $1,000 if it is converted into $2,000 of ether after 12 months of holding.30 It would be taxed as ordinary income if exchanged before holding it for 12 months.3 \nIf a client receives a cryptocurrency as a gift, they count the time the giver held it in their holding period. However, there must be documentation of the period. If there is no documentation proving the giver's holding time, the receiver's holding period starts the day after they receive it.31\nMultiple Crypto Assets \nMultiple cryptocurrency transactions can trigger different types of taxes, which is why it's important for clients to keep a log of their transactions. This log helps them or a tax professional determine how a transaction will be taxed. Here's an example—for simplicity, blockchain and exchange fees are left out, along with any other costs incurred, and market values remain constant, so the basis remains the purchase price: \nAn investor bought $10 worth of bitcoin on March 13, 2022\nThe next day, they swapped the bitcoin for $13 of ether\nOne year later (March 14, 2023), they swapped the ether for $14 of litecoin\nThe next day (March 15, 2023), they sold the Litecoin for $15 and took cash\nTax events would look like this: \nBitcoin to ether would yield $3 of ordinary income (2022)\nEther to litecoin would yield $1 of capital gains (2023)\nLitecoin to cash would result in $1 in ordinary income (2023)\nThe investor would include $3 in ordinary income from cryptocurrency on their 2022 tax return. On their 2023 tax return, they would report $1 in capital gains and $1 in ordinary income from cryptocurrency transactions.3 \nCrypto exchanges domiciled in the U.S. are legally required to report account activity on customers who gained at least $600 on their trades every year. Exchanges send documents with this information, Form 1099-B, Form 1099-K, and Form 1099-MISC, to the IRS and the customer at the end of the tax year.32\nAddressing Common Client Questions \nExpect clients to pose several questions about cryptocurrency taxes. Being ready to clarify the most common questions can help to quickly smooth over most concerns. That can be achieved by researching ahead of time and identifying which issues are mentioned often. Again, be mindful of how you, as a financial advisor, can help. \nHere are some questions that frequently pop up regarding cryptocurrency taxes: \nHow Much Will I Owe in Taxes on My Cryptocurrency Holdings? \nClients might want financial advisors to exercise an outcome-based approach and give them a concrete perspective on their tax obligations. These numbers don’t need to be exact but should provide an estimate of the client’s tax rate. \nAre Taxes Calculated Differently for Each Cryptocurrency Asset? \nCryptocurrencies are taxed based on how they were acquired, how long they are held, and how they are used—not their names. For example, a single crypto asset, like bitcoin or ether, could be taxed differently than another if it came from different sources. Multiple crypto assets, popular or niche, could be taxed similarly if they came from similar sources. \nThe tax rate specific to the source will apply to only the amount of crypto that came from the source at a given time. Taxes calculated across different sources are then added up by category to determine the overall tax owed. Sources include exchanges, mining, staking, interest, airdrops, and family and friends.2 \nHow Can I Reduce the Cryptocurrency Taxes I Owe? \nClients look for cost-cutting measures in their everyday budgets, spending habits, and tax liabilities. Knowing as many applicable tax codes, investment products, and financial mathematics as possible will help you explain the most effective tax-saving strategies and prevent oversight of options that could have been considered.\nProviding Tax Planning and Compliance Services \nWhile a financial advisor’s job is to provide guidance, not every responsibility falls on their shoulders. Financial advisors are there to give general advice, tips, and pointers to improve financial health with a holistic view. They are not there to perform accounting down to an exact number, submit taxes on behalf of a client, project every tax arbitrage potential, and act as counsel parsing the law. \nIt’s virtually impossible to provide effective financial planning services without doing some math. For example, a cost-effective breakeven point could be assessed between the tax savings plus brokerage fees charged on a crypto IRA vs. the tax costs plus transaction fees of crypto traded on an exchange. \nRefer Clients to Appropriate Professionals \nHowever, tax calculations and projections need to be examined in conclusive detail and officially signed off by a certified tax professional. Financial advisors can refer clients to licensed accountants, actuaries, auditors, and lawyers to establish and forecast precise numbers and legal compliance.33 \nIt is especially practical for heavy crypto investors to hire an accountant to finalize their taxes—and an auditor if the investments are for a business or a fund.3435 \nAnticipate your client’s needs while balancing and communicating your broadly defined duties as a financial advisor. The goal is to act as a structured starting point and springboard for more intermediate and advanced financial planning ideas and processes.\nAnyone can calculate taxes with crypto tax preparation software, which can automatically calculate taxes and extract data uploaded from more than one crypto wallet, exchange, and blockchain. Using software may be unavoidable if a client handles a high volume of crypto transactions.\nResources for Further Information \nCryptocurrency is still relatively new, and the regulation of it is evolving. Staying current on the market and how it is taxed is critical to assisting clients investing in it. \nThe best sources of recent and timely tax information are tax agencies. The IRS and state and territory tax departments have FAQ pages and webpages discussing digital asset tax accounting and related publications. \nMajor cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency news sites have blog posts and articles with the latest changes and materials about cryptocurrency taxation. However, it is more accurate and comprehensive to get the information straight from the source: the tax regulators and other regulatory bodies. \nCan I Identify Specific Batches of Coins I Sold?\nYes, IRS rules allow you to point out which specific units of crypto were sold. To do so, you must identify the unit by an identifier or transaction record. Parceling out specific batches can be helpful if you sell crypto with different cost bases and want more discretion in calculating capital gains or losses.36\nWhich Tax Forms Are Used to Report Crypto?\nState tax forms vary, but federal tax forms are standard at the IRS. For individual tax returns, investment income is reported on Form 1040, Schedule D, and Form 8949.3 Ordinary income is reported for employee work on Form 1040 and for contractor work on Schedule C, Part I, with self-employment income and other compensation.3738 Gifts, including receipts of crypto donations, are reported on Form 709.39 Donors of crypto can deduct the donations on Form 1040, Schedule A.40 Income is reported on Form 1120 for corporate tax returns and on Form 1065 for limited partnership fund returns.4142\nWhat If I Don’t Know the Cost Basis for My Crypto?\nThe cost basis of a cryptocurrency transaction, if it isn’t clear, may need to be treated as $0 when it is sold. That means paying capital gains tax on the full proceeds from the sale.43\nThe Bottom Line \nCryptocurrencies are taxed in myriad ways, presenting various tax savings that can be brought into focus and customized for individual clients with broad guidance from a financial advisor or specific, expert advice from a tax advisor. \nAs a financial advisor, be sure that you understand the kind of advice that you can offer your clients about crypto taxes and when to recommend that they speak with a tax or other professional. \nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

You can learn more about our independent review process and partners in our advertiser disclosure . We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links.\nRobinhood and eToro have several things in common. Both are online discount brokers created to provide platforms for everyone to have access to trading without excessive fees. Both brokers also focus on providing simpler self-directed investing by incorporating innovative technology. Finally, both brokers were industry disruptors, with eToro entering the industry in 2007 and Robinhood following a few years later in 2013.12 \nThere are, of course, important differences beyond this. Robinhood stands out for its IRA retirement accounts, including giving investors up to a 3% match on contributions, a feature unique in the industry. However, eToro has a far larger selection of crypto assets and was our pick as the best broker for cryptocurrency trading. We’ll look deeper at these two trading platforms to help you decide which one is a better fit for your portfolio needs. \nAccount Minimum: $0 \nFees: $0 commissions for stock, ETF, options, and cryptocurrency trading \nAccount Minimum: $50-$200 minimum deposit for most regions, $200 minimum per trader for copy trading features, $500 minimum investment for Portfolio \nFees: 1% crypto trading fee plus market spread; no-fee stock, ETF, and options trading ($1-$2 per trade fee in select few countries), plus market spread; 2% crypto asset transfer fee \nWarning\nDon’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Take two minutes to learn more.\nThis article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed.\nUsability \nBoth Robinhood and eToro offer streamlined platforms that make it easier for investors of any experience level to find information. Both brokers offer a website and mobile app platform. Robinhood’s platforms have similar layouts and near identical experiences. Investors can customize both platforms and can customize the price charts in each platform. Robinhood has partnered with NASDAQ to provide investors with access to real-time streaming stock quotes on both of its platforms.3 Robinhood has significantly upgraded its charting capabilities, something long-demanded by users. New chart features include moving averages, allowing investors to better analyze stock trends.4 \neToro also offers customizable advanced charting tools. These charts allow you to apply technical studies and use common drawing tools, putting eToro’s charting capabilities ahead of Robinhood.5 Investors can benefit from eToro’s Smart Portfolios tool, a form of automated investing using a “predetermined strategy,” as well as CopyTrader, which is a tool that lets investors mimic the strategies and portfolios of more experienced traders.6 The platform’s News Feed allows traders to share their market insights so other investors can decide whether to copy them. \nUsability Verdict: eToro \nRobinhood and eToro both have user-friendly platforms. However, eToro leads in this category because its users have access to more robust features in the mobile app and website platforms, especially given the unique social trading elements. \nTrade Experience \nDesktop Experience \nRobinhood and eToro have streamlined website platforms. Both brokers keep things simple for their users and do not provide a robust collection of advanced research and trading tools. However, eToro provides features that Robinhood does not, such as a trading journal, access to proprietary research, and access to international exchanges. \nDesktop Experience Verdict: eToro \neToro is a leader in online social investing and has some interesting features for investors, like One-Click Trading, which allows traders to quickly open positions with preset parameters.7 These more advanced features make eToro the winner in this category. \nMobile Experience \nBoth eToro and Robinhood are strong choices for investors who favor user-friendly mobile trading platforms. eToro’s social feel is highlighted through the mobile design. eToro’s mobile users have access to a drawing tool in the charting feature, but Robinhood lacks in this area by not offering a drawing tool in either platform. Robinhood also does not allow trades to be executed directly from charts. \nThere are some areas where eToro and Robinhood tie. Both brokers’ mobile apps support the same order types and provide access to the same asset classes as the website platforms. Additionally, both brokers’ mobile platforms provide real-time streaming stock quotes and real-time portfolio reports. \nMobile Experience Verdict: eToro \nOverall, Robinhood and eToro have all the features in their mobile app platforms to meet the needs of new and passive investors. However, more active traders may prefer eToro’s mobile platform due to the availability of more tools. \nRange of Offerings \nRobinhood offerings include stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, cryptocurrencies, fractional share trading for stocks and ETFs, fractional cryptocurrency trading, and a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for stock and ETF dividends. Robinhood offers the Robinhood Cash Card (debit card) and a web3 wallet for customers who want to store their digital assets, including NFTs. eToro’s offerings include stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, options, fractional share trading, the eToro Money account, a crypto wallet, and automated investing through Smart Portfolios.8 eToro has a larger selection of available cryptocurrencies than Robinhood.9 \nRobinhood and eToro have limited offerings in comparison to other brokers. Neither offers mutual funds, forex, or futures trading. Neither Robinhood nor eToro allows short selling, but Robinhood offers a margin account. Robinhood also offers IRA and Roth IRA retirement accounts, while eToro does not. Robinhood matches annual IRA contributions up to 3% to encourage users to deposit more money.10 \nRange of Offerings Verdict: Tie \nThe winner in this category depends on what someone is looking for. Robinhood’s range of offerings is better for investors saving for retirement, while eToro is better for crypto investing. \nCompare Range of Offerings \nOrder Types \nRobinhood’s order types are based on the asset class. Limit, market, stop, and stop limit orders are available for cryptocurrencies. Limit, stop limit, and market orders are available for options. Market, limit, stop, stop-limit, and trailing stop orders are available for stocks.11 Some stocks can be placed as good-for-day (GFD) or good-til-canceled (GTC) orders. Robinhood also offers a 24-hour market for select stocks and ETFs. You can set up limit orders when markets are closed and pick the time when the app will try to execute them using your set limit price.12 \neToro provides the basic order types such as market, limit, stop loss, and take profit. Additionally, eToro offers One-Click Trading with predetermined factors such as leverage, take profit, and stop loss. \nOrder Types Verdict: Robinhood \nRobinhood edges out eToro in this category due to the availability of more order options. \nTrading Technology \nRobinhood is continuing to provide new and improved trading tools to meet customers' needs. Some examples include charting tools and a web3 wallet platform for advanced cryptocurrency trading. \nBoth Robinhood and eToro receive payment for order flow (PFOF). eToro has an agreement with Apex Clearing, which handles the order routing and discloses PFOF that was on the low end when we evaluated it—although it is hard to know what is specific to eToro flow. Robinhood publicly discloses its order execution quality statistics. It reported that 95.23% of orders were executed at the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) or better in the first quarter of 2024.13 \nBoth eToro and Robinhood offer a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) and fractional share trading on all platforms. In terms of innovation, eToro offers CopyTrader and Smart Portfolios, which are somewhat automated features that allow users to copy other investors’ investing behaviors and choose options from portfolios that are already diversified. These are the closest options to having a robo-advisor. As an added benefit, eToro has a dedicated team that monitors the portfolio's performances and assists with other actions, such as rebalancing. \nTrading Technology Verdict: Tie \neToro offers users the ability to customize charts, a trading journal, and some screening tools. Neither broker offers backtesting features. This category is a tie. Depending on what is most important to investors, either broker could meet their needs. \nCosts \nBoth brokers provide commission-free stocks, options, and ETFs. eToro charges a 1% commission for cryptocurrencies, whereas Robinhood does not charge commissions for cryptocurrencies. Robinhood’s margin rate is 6.25%, and Gold subscribers get a lower rate.14 eToro does not have a traditional margin account, although leverage can be accessed on certain investments for a fee. eToro requires a minimum investment of $200 to use the CopyTrader feature.15 \nCosts Verdict: Robinhood \nRobinhood provides more cost savings for investors and therefore is the leader in this category. \nCompare Costs \nAccount and Research Amenities \nBoth Robinhood and eToro are lacking in this area in comparison to the advanced tools provided by other brokers. Platform research features that are available to investors are user-friendly but limited. eToro does not provide calculators or trading idea generators besides its CopyTrader system. New Robinhood investors can receive a first Trade recommendation for a portfolio of ETFs.16 However, Robinhood does not provide trading ideas or calculators beyond that. \nRobinhood does not offer proprietary research. Robinhood Gold users do gain access to Morningstar in-depth stock research reports, though it costs $5 per month to join Robinhood Gold. \nOn the other hand, eToro offers its customers free proprietary and third-party research information. Both brokers offer investors daily market reports. While both brokers offer screeners and watchlists, eToro’s are more comprehensive. For example, eToro offers stock and ETF screeners, while Robinhood only offers a stock screener. \nAccount and Research Amenities Verdict: eToro \neToro wins in this category for providing slightly more research amenities for free. \nCompare Account and Research Amenities \nPortfolio Analysis \nRobinhood and eToro both have limited portfolio analysis tools. Robinhood offers a sector allocation monitor, which is a portfolio tracking feature. When it comes to portfolio reports, both brokers offer these reports to investors in all platforms. Neither broker offers backtesting strategy features. \nPortfolio Analysis Verdict: Tie \nOther than normal access to daily balances, positions, etc., there are no advanced analysis tools. In this category, Robinhood and eToro tie. \nEducation \nRobinhood has been working to expand its educational resources. Robinhood Learn is a library of investing education including the basics of investing, various investing terms, financial literacy, taxes, entrepreneurship, and more.17 Robinhood Learn content is in the form of articles, videos, and in-app course modules. Additionally, Robinhood offers its customers a three-minute read newsletter called Robinhood Snacks that is emailed to subscribers weekly.18 Robinhood also runs a podcast. \neToro Academy is eToro’s free online investing education platform. On this platform, customers can find educational information on various financial topics and additional insight on some of eToro’s trading tools. It covers material for both beginner and advanced investors. eToro also provides a free Virtual Demo account, where investors can test strategies and learn using play money. \nEducation Verdict: Tie \nThis category is a tie, given that both companies provide a variety of educational materials. \nCustomer Service \nLimited direct access to customer service is an issue for both Robinhood and eToro. Both brokers offer a Help Center containing answers to common questions on their website and mobile platforms. Only current Robinhood customers have direct access to customer service, which is available after logging into their accounts on the website or mobile platforms. \nRobinhood upport is available through a 24/7 live chat and by telephone from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, but only via the in-app callback feature. eToro offers visitors an option to open a customer service request ticket on the website. \nCustomer Service Verdict: Robinhood \nWhile both companies could be better, Robinhood has a slight edge thanks to its 24/7 live chat and available phone support. \nSecurity \nRobinhood and eToro both offer two-factor authentication, encryption, and biometric logins on all trading platforms. Robinhood and eToro customer assets are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) for up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for cash).1920 \nTransparency has previously been an issue for current and prospective customers for Robinhood due to an outage on both platforms in March 2020 and a data security breach on Nov. 3, 2021.2122 \nSecurity Verdict: eToro \neToro edges out Robinhood in this category with no reported outages or data security breaches. \nThe Bottom Line \nNew and passive investors seeking streamlined, simple platforms will most likely be satisfied with either Robinhood or eToro. Both Robinhood and eToro will appeal to investors who prefer mobile investing because both brokers' mobile app platforms offer the same features as their website platforms. \nRobinhood is the better choice for investors saving for retirement. It offers both IRA and Roth IRA retirement accounts, including up to a 3% matching contribution when users deposit money. eToro does not have retirement accounts. Robinhood also has a slight edge on cost savings as it does not charge commissions on any trades. \neToro is better for crypto investing thanks to its wide selection of cryptocurrencies. eToro has slightly more trading capabilities, including the ability to mimic the portfolios of successful investors using its CopyTrader system. Still, neither eToro nor Robinhood is meant for serious day traders. Both are geared toward beginner, passive, and cost-conscious investors. This group would find either broker an appealing, affordable choice. \nHow We Picked the Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms \nProviding readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia.

  "text": "10 Tips for Successful Long-Term Investing\nWhile the stock market is riddled with uncertainty, certain tried-and-true principles can help investors boost their chances for long-term success. \nSome investors lock in profits by selling their appreciated investments while holding onto underperforming stocks they hope will rebound. But good stocks can climb further, and poor stocks risk zeroing out completely. Below we discuss 10 tips for successful long-term investing that can help you prevent mistakes and hopefully generate some profits. \nKey Takeaways\nThe stock market is riddled with uncertainty, but certain tried-and-true principles can help investors boost their chances for long-term success. \nSome of the more important basic investment advice includes riding winners and selling losers; avoiding the urge to chase \"hot tips\"; resisting the lure of penny stocks; and picking a strategy and then sticking to it.\nIf your time horizon allows it, a focus on the future with an eye toward long-term investing can maximize profits for almost any investor.\n1. Sell the Losers and Let the Winners Ride \nPeter Lynch famously spoke about \"tenbaggers\"—investments that increased tenfold in value. He attributed his success to a small number of these stocks in his portfolio. \nBut this required the discipline of hanging onto stocks even after they’ve increased by many multiples if he thought there was still significant upside potential. The takeaway: avoid clinging to arbitrary rules and consider a stock on its own merits.1 \nThere is no guarantee that a stock will rebound after a protracted decline, and it’s important to be realistic about the prospect of poorly performing investments. And even though acknowledging losing stocks can psychologically signal failure, there is no shame in recognizing mistakes and selling off investments to stem further loss. \nIn both scenarios, it’s critical to judge companies on their merits to determine whether a price justifies future potential. \n2. Don't Chase a Hot Tip \nRegardless of the source, never accept a stock tip as valid. Always do your own analysis of a company before investing your hard-earned money. \nTips do sometimes pan out, depending upon the reliability of the source, but long-term success demands deep-dive research.\n3. Don't Sweat the Small Stuff \nRather than panic over an investment’s short-term movements, it’s better to track its big-picture trajectory. Have confidence in an investment’s larger story, and don’t be swayed by short-term volatility. \nDon't overemphasize the few cents difference you might save from using a limit versus market order. Sure, active traders use minute-to-minute fluctuations to lock in gains but long-term investors succeed based on periods lasting 20 years or more. \n4. Don't Overemphasize the P/E Ratio \nInvestors often place great importance on price-earnings ratios, but placing too much emphasis on a single metric is ill-advised. P/E ratios are best used in conjunction with other analytical processes. \nTherefore, a low P/E ratio doesn't necessarily mean a security is undervalued, nor does a high P/E ratio necessarily mean a company is overvalued.\n5. Resist the Lure of Penny Stocks \nSome mistakenly believe there’s less to lose with low-priced stocks. But whether a $5 stock plunges to $0 or a $75 stock does the same, you've lost 100% of your initial investment, so both stocks carry similar downside risks. \nIn fact, penny stocks are likely riskier than higher-priced stocks because they tend to be less regulated and often see much more volatility.\n6. Pick a Strategy and Stick With It \nThere are many ways to pick stocks, and it’s important to stick with a single philosophy. Vacillating between different approaches effectively makes you a market timer, which is dangerous territory. \nConsider how noted investor Warren Buffett stuck to his value-oriented strategy and steered clear of the dotcom boom of the late '90s—consequently avoiding major losses when tech startups crashed.\n7. Focus on the Future \nInvesting requires making informed decisions based on things that have yet to happen. Past data can indicate things to come, but it’s never guaranteed. \nIn his 1989 book \"One Up on Wall Street\" Peter Lynch stated: \"If I'd bothered to ask myself, 'How can this stock possibly go higher?' I would never have bought Subaru after it had already gone up twentyfold. But I checked the fundamentals, realized that Subaru was still cheap, bought the stock, and made sevenfold after that.\"2 \nIt’s important to invest based on future potential versus past performance.\n8. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective \nIt's best to avoid the \"get in, get out\" mentality of quickly trying to profit from trades. If you've done your research and found a solid stock that continues to be a good investment, holding onto it for the long term should bring profits. \nWhile large short-term profits can often entice market neophytes, long-term investing is essential to greater success. And while short-term active trading can make money, this involves greater risk than buy-and-hold strategies. \n9. Be Open-Minded \nMany great companies are household names, but many good investments lack brand awareness. Furthermore, thousands of smaller companies have the potential to become the blue-chip names of tomorrow. \nThis is not to suggest that you should devote your entire portfolio to small-cap stocks, but there are many great companies beyond those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n10. Keep Taxes in Mind, But Don't Worry \nPutting taxes above all else can cause investors to make misguided decisions. While tax implications are important, they are secondary to investing and securely growing your money. \nWhile you should strive to minimize tax liability, achieving high returns is the primary goal. \nWhat Is Long-Term Investing?\nLong-term investing is generally considered to be three years or more. Holding onto an asset, such as stocks or real estate for more than three years is considered long-term. When individuals sell assets at a profit, capital gains taxes are charged for investments held for longer than one year. Investments held for less than a year are charged taxes at an investor's ordinary income, which is not as favorable as the capital gains tax rate.3\nWhat Is the Safest Investment With the Highest Return?\nNo investment is 100% safe but some are safer than others, and of those, some have higher returns. Such assets include certificates of deposit, high-yield savings accounts, Series I savings bonds, Treasury Bills, and money market funds.\nWhat Are the Cons of Long-Term Investing?\nThe primary con of long-term investing is its opportunity cost. Funds that are tied up in long-term investments cannot be used for other investments, particularly short-term profitable opportunities. This may not be an issue in the future if the long-term investments bring in enough profit.\nThe Bottom Line \nInvesting in stocks never guarantees profits and can be challenging due to the constant fluctuation of the markets, movements in the economy, policy changes, world events, and more. Even with a lot of research, it can be hard to pick a winner or know when a winner becomes a loser and vice versa. Heeding to the above 10 tips can help make you a better investor and hopefully bring in some profits.",

  "text": "Are You Investing or Gambling?\nGambling is defined as staking something on a contingency — wagering money on something that has an uncertain and potentially negative outcome. However, when trading is considered, gambling takes on a much more complex dynamic than the definition presents. Many traders are gambling without even knowing it — trading in a way, or for a reason that is completely dichotomous with success in the markets. \nIn this article, we will look at the hidden ways in which gambling creeps into trading practices, as well as the stimulus that may drive an individual to trade (and possibly gamble) in the first place. \nKey Takeaways\nThere are two common traits in those who exhibit gambling tendencies when trading.\nIf a person trades for excitement or social proofing reasons, rather than in a methodical way, they are likely trading in a gambling style.\nIf a person trades only to win, they are likely gambling. Traders with a \"must-win\" attitude will often fail to recognize a losing trade and exit their positions.\nHidden Gambling Tendencies \nIt is quite likely that anyone who believes they don't have gambling tendencies will not happily admit to having them if it turns out they are in fact acting on gambling impulses. Yet discovering the underlying motives behind our actions can help us change the way we make decisions in the future. \nBefore delving into gambling tendencies when actually trading, one tendency is apparent in many people before trading even takes place. This same motivator continues to impact traders as they gain experience and become regular market participants. \nSocial Proofing \nSome people may not even have an interest in trading or investing in the financial markets, but social pressure induces them to trade or invest anyway. This is especially common when large numbers of people are talking about investing in the markets (often during the final phase of a bull market). People feel pressure to fall in line with their social circle. Thus they invest so as not to disrespect or disregard others' beliefs or feel left out. \nMaking some trades to appease social forces is not gambling in and of itself if people actually know what they are doing. However, entering into a financial transaction without a solid investment understanding is gambling. Such people lack the knowledge to exert control over the profitability of their choices. \nThere are many variables in the market, and misinformation among investors or traders creates a gambling scenario. Until knowledge has been developed that allows people to overcome the odds of losing, gambling is taking place with each transaction that occurs. \nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call the National Council on Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-522-4700, or visit NCPGambling.org/Chat to chat with a helpline specialist.1\nContributing Gambling Factors \nOnce someone is involved in the financial markets, there is a learning curve, which based on the social proofing discussion above may seem like it is gambling. This may or may not be true based on the individual. How the person approaches the market will determine whether they become a successful trader or remain a perpetual gambler in the financial markets. \nThe following two traits (among many) are easily overlooked but contribute to gambling tendencies in traders. \nGambling (Trading) for Excitement \nEven a losing trade can stir emotions and a sense of power or satisfaction, especially when related to social proofing. If everyone in a person's social circle is losing money in the markets, losing money on a trade will allow that person to enter the conversation with their own story. \nWhen a person trades for excitement or social proofing reasons, it is likely they are trading in a gambling style, rather than in a methodical and tested way. Trading the markets is exciting—it links the person into a global network of traders and investors with different ideas, backgrounds, and beliefs. Yet getting caught up in the \"idea\" of trading, the excitement, or emotional highs and lows, is likely to detract from acting in a systematic and methodical way. \nSpeculation involves making a risky investment, but one with a positive expected return. The expected return for gambling is always negative for the player, even though some may get lucky and win in the short run.\nTrading to Win, and Not Trading a System \nTrading in a methodical and systematic way is important in any odds-based scenario. Trading to win seems like the most obvious reason to trade. After all, why trade if you can't win? But there is a hidden detrimental flaw when it comes to this belief and trading. \nWhile making money is the desired overall result, trading to win can actually drive us further away from making money. If winning is our prime motivator, the following scenario is likely to play out: \nTaylor buys a stock they feel is oversold. The stock continues to fall, placing Taylor in a negative position. Instead of realizing the stock is not simply oversold and something else must be going on, Taylor continues to hold, hoping the stock will come back so they can win (or at least break even) on the trade. The focus on winning has forced the trader into the position where they don't get out of bad positions, because to do so would be to admit they lost. \nGood traders take many losses—they admit they are wrong and keep the damage small. Not having to win on every trade and taking losses when conditions indicate they should is what allows them to be profitable over many trades. Holding losing positions after original entry conditions have changed or turned negative means the trader is now gambling and no longer using sound trading methods (if they ever were). \nIs Investing Basically Gambling?\nInvesting is the act of committing capital to an asset like a stock, with the expectation of generating income or profit. Gambling, on the other hand, is wagering money on an uncertain outcome, that statistically is likely to be negative. A gambler owns nothing, while an investor owns a share of the underlying company. \nIs Gambling a Smart Way to Make Money?\nStatistically, gambling is not a smart way to make money. The odds are against the gambler, with the house having a built-in mathematical advantage that grows over time. While it is possible to win a big payout, or to mitigate risk through selective playing based on research and odds, overall, most gamblers will end up losing money. \nIs It Better to Invest Than Gamble?\nWhile both involve minimizing risk to reap rewards, an investor's odds are generally better than that of a gambler. That's because with gambling, the house has an edge, a statistical advantage over the gambler that grows the longer the person is playing. A gambler can still strike it big, but it's more likely the person will ultimately lose. Investing can yield great losses, but the stock market generally appreciates over time, and if you keep investing, the odds are generally in your favor, certainly more so than for a gambler.\nThe Bottom Line \nGambling tendencies run far deeper than most people initially perceive and well beyond the standard definitions. Gambling can take the form of needing to socially prove one's self, or acting in a way to be socially accepted, which results in taking action in a field one knows little about. \nGambling in the markets is often evident in people who do it mostly for the emotional high they receive from the excitement and action of the markets. Finally, relying on emotion or a must-win attitude to create profits—rather than trading in a methodical and tested system—indicates the person is gambling in the markets and unlikely to succeed over the course of many trades. \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "What Is EUV, and How Does It Work?\nExtreme ultraviolet (EUV) light technology is a key driver of change in the semiconductor industry. Lithography, the method used for printing intricate patterns onto semiconductor materials, has advanced by using ever shorter wavelengths since the beginning of the semiconductor age.1 EUV lithography is the shortest yet. \nIn development for decades, the first EUV lithography machine bought in batches and ready for production was from ASML, the Dutch semiconductor company.2 \nKey Takeaways\nExtreme ultraviolet (EUV) light has a very short wavelength, close to that of an X-ray.\nEUV light is used in microchip lithography to print patterns onto silicon wafers.\nASML, a Dutch company, is pioneering this technology and is the only source of EUV lithography systems.\nThe short wavelength of EUV light allows for the manufacturing of some of the most powerful microchips available.\nWhat Is EUV Lithography? \nEUV light refers to the extreme ultraviolet light used for microchip lithography, which involves coating the microchip wafer in a photosensitive material and carefully exposing it to light. This prints a pattern onto the wafer, which is used for further steps in the microchip design process. \nThe history of computers is the history of the semiconductor industry, which in turn is the history of the relentless pursuit of miniaturization. In the sector’s initial phase from the 1950s to mid-’80s, photolithography was done through UV light and photomasks to project circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.2 \nDuring this time, Moore’s Law—the 1960s dictum that the number of transistors on a microchip would double every two years—started coming up against the physical limits of this process. This meant that the staggering increases in computing power and reduced technology costs for consumers were also in danger of hitting a limit. From the 1980s to the 2000s, deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography drove the next generation of miniaturization, using shorter wavelengths in the range of 153 to 248 nanometers, which allowed for smaller imprints on the silicon wafers of semiconductors.2 \nIn leading up to the new millennium, researchers and competing firms worldwide looked for breakthroughs in making EUV lithography and its even shorter wavelengths possible. ASML completed a prototype in 2003, though it would take another decade to develop a system ready for production.21 \nEvery few years since then, ASML has delivered the next iteration of its EUV lithography systems with more capacity for production and wavelengths down to 13.5 nanometers. This allows for incredibly precise microchip designs and the densest possible placement of transistors on microchips—in short, it enables faster computer speeds.3 \nHow EUV Lithography Works \nASML’s EUV lithography systems emit light with wavelengths of about 13.5 nanometers, which is significantly shorter than the wavelengths used in the previous generation of DUV lithography, thus enabling finer patterns to be printed on semiconductor wafers​. The most advanced microchips can have nodes as small as 7, 5, and 3 nanometers, which are made by repeatedly passing the semiconductor wafers through the EUV lithography system. \nThough you won’t be able to follow these steps in your garage workshop to make semiconductors, they are important for understanding how the technology involved can be advanced and where potential investment funds might be best placed. First, a high-intensity laser is directed at a material (usually tin) to generate plasma (charged electrons and protons in motion). The plasma then emits the EUV light at a wavelength of about 13.5 nanometers.23 \nThe generated light is gathered and directed through a series of mirrors and optics through a mask or reticle as a circuit pattern is placed in the path of the EUV light, in a manner loosely analogous to using a stencil to paint a pattern on a board. A material called photoresist on the wafer is sensitive to EUV light, and the areas exposed to it go through a chemical change and are then etched. New materials may then be deposited in the etched areas to form the various components of the microchip. This process can be repeated up to 100 times with different masks to create multilayered, complex circuits on a single wafer.41 \nAfter these steps, the wafer undergoes further processes to remove impurities and get the chip ready to be sliced into individual chips. They are then packaged for use in electronic devices. \nEUV vs. DUV Lithography \nWhile major purchases of EUV lithography systems have been driving news in the superconductor industry, given the dramatic costs involved and the technological advances it could bring, DUV lithography is still more widely used. It has the advantage of already being in manufacturing facilities with staff trained in its use. \nEUV lithography, with its extremely short wavelengths of about 13.5 nanometers, allows for finer etching of smaller features on chips. For its part, DUV lithography operates at wavelengths starting at 153 nanometers. While chipmakers can use this for designs with sizes as small as 5 nanometers or less, pushing the boundaries of physics, DUV light can only be used for sub-10-nanometer sizes with a loss in resolution quality.2 \nEUV lithography systems not only come with the startup costs of newer technologies but also are inherently more expensive than the equipment and maintenance for DUV lithography. For example, EUV lithography systems installed by Intel in 2023 cost $150 million each.5 This cost makes DUV lithography systems preferred for uses where EUV lithography’s smaller size is unnecessary.1 \nDUV lithography is also a known quantity: There is no need for additional training, new facilities, and other major capital investments that EUV light systems require. DUV light technology is still needed for many chips in phones, computers, cars, and robots, and it has proved robust and versatile. Its relatively simpler processes also mean that DUV lithography can produce more chips per unit of time than EUV lithography, an important point in its favor in light of the global demand for semiconductors.\nMany expect DUV lithography to remain popular for years to come. This is in part because of the price of EUV lithography and the technical issues that come with any new technology. In addition, DUV lithograph technology is not stuck in place, continuing to improve how it helps create the chips found in the many electronic devices of our everyday lives.6 \nThe industry is likely in a transition, and while EUV light will play an increasingly more central role in chip manufacturing, DUV lithography is still vital to the production of electronics used in our everyday lives. \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of EUV Lithography \nEUV lithography is a relatively new technology that brings many advantages and some drawbacks to consider. \nAdvantages \nEUV lithography brings many advantages that could lead to future developments in microchip production. Here are two of the reasons why semiconductor companies like Intel are investing so much in the technology: \nEUV light can produce more complex and fine patterns on silicon wafers, allowing for more transistors to be placed on a microchip.\nEUV lithography reduces the number of pattern layers (mask count) required to create a circuit.1\nDisadvantages \nEUV lithography has many benefits, but as a new technology, it’s important to consider its drawbacks. \nEUV lithography systems are more expensive than other systems for microchip lithography.\nASML is the only company manufacturing these systems, which could create a bottleneck for companies wishing to use EUV lithography or in need of support for their machinery.1\nIs ASML the Only EUV Lithography Company?\nYes, ASML is the only company that makes and sells products that use EUV lithography systems for microchip lithography.7\nWhat Will Replace EUV Lithography?\nTechnology is frequently improving, and the demand for microchips with increasingly dense transistors continues. While EUV lithography is at the limits of the technology, research into technology that could improve upon or replace it continues. Multi-e-beam, X-ray lithography, nanoimprint lithography, and quantum lithography could all overtake EUV lithography in the future.2\nWhen Is EUV Light Used?\nExtreme ultraviolet light is used in the production of microchips. EUV lithography prints a pattern on silicon wafers during the manufacturing process.\nWhat Is Moore’s Law?\nMoore’s Law says that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years. This means that computers get faster and more capable every two years, with that growth being exponential. The law is named after Gordon E. Moore, a co-founder of Intel. Though it held true for many years, some predict it will end in the 2020s.\nThe Bottom Line \nEUV light is used in microchip lithography to produce the patterns necessary to create a microchip, though at far smaller sizes than from previous lithographic techniques. However, because of its novelty, only one company—ASML—makes machines that use it, and they are costly. As the technology matures, it should play a central role in future developments in microchip production.",

  "text": "How To Be a Conservative Investor\nMention conservative investing, and people think of putting money away in the biggest, most stable and risk-averse enterprises and assets, which in turn guarantees safety of principal (if the invested capital happens to also appreciate in value, that's even better). While it's true that some industries (such as utilities) are defined as conservative, simply buying the large, well-known companies does not fulfill the goal of a successful conservative investment approach. Instead, such a viewpoint increases the confusion between acting conservatively and behaving conventionally. \nDefinitions \nConservative investing, when understood and applied properly, is not a low-risk, low-return strategy. Investors must understand two definitions to appreciate the appropriate means by which to invest conservatively. \nA conservative investment is one that carries the greatest likelihood of preserving the purchasing power of one's capital with the least amount of risk.\nConservative investing is the understanding of what a conservative investment is, and then following a specific course of action needed to properly determine whether or not particular investments are indeed conservative investments.\nWhere many investors falter in attempting to invest conservatively is blindly assuming that, by purchasing any security that qualifies as a conservative investment, they are in fact conservative investors. In other words, such investors simply focus on the first definition. \nSuch a viewpoint is limited and costly. A successful conservative investment approach requires not only an understanding of what a conservative investment is, but—more importantly—the correct approach to take in order to identify what truly qualifies as a conservative investment. \nCharacteristics of a Conservative Investment \nIf, based on the first definition, investors already know what qualifies as a conservative investment, they needs to know which characteristics define a conservative investment, which is where the second definition comes into play. There are three broad categories which investors can use to identify a conservative investment. \nThe Safety Factor\nClearly, any conservative investment should be able to weather market storms better than the rest. In order to do this, certain characteristics must stand out. First, a business should have a low cost of production. Being a low-cost producer has the principal advantage that, when a bad year hits the industry, the chance of still churning out a profit or reporting a smaller net loss is available. Second, a business should have a strong research and marketing department. A company that cannot compete by staying abreast of market changes and trends is doomed in the long run. Finally, management should possess financial skill. In doing so, it will be well versed in things such as per unit cost of production, maximizing return on investment capital, and other essential elements of business success.\nThe People Factor\nThis is a rather self-explanatory qualification for a conservative investment. But take notice that excellent people can only be beneficial after a business has demonstrated the signs of the above-mentioned quality. Take note of Warren Buffett's advice: \"When a management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.\" A small company can succeed on the heels of one or two exceptionally-talented people. But as a business grows, people throughout the organization must be counted if the company is to succeed and remain a conservative investment.\nCharacteristics of the Business\nThis third quality requires a little more work for investors, but is well worth the effort. Here, the goal is to determine what advantages (or disadvantages) may prevent the business from growing and earning more profits, despite satisfying the first two conditions. One important thing to consider is the competitive landscape of the industry; the existence of many competitors or the relative ease with which new competition can enter can affect the best of companies. The potential for excessive regulation could also be a game changer.\nEven when a company satisfies the obvious conditions of being a conservative investment, you should always remember to consider this third condition. \nThose Who Fail and Those Who Pass \nGreat examples of those businesses that pass the test include names such as Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). These companies have demonstrated time and time again the strengths of their franchises. Even more importantly, these companies will likely continue to have very favorable future prospects. Coke essentially competes with Pepsi and no one else. What's more, it's unlikely that entrepreneurs are sitting in garages thinking about creating the next great soft drink company. \nThe existence and continued success of Walmart should raise a red flag for most other retailers, save for Target. Remember Circuit City, which used to be number two in electronics stores? It's now bankrupt, in no small part due to Walmart. Of course, once a passing company has been identified, the stock price only matters in determining the value gained. \nThe Bottom Line \nInvesting conservatively is not about simply identifying large, well-known businesses, but also going through a process that identifies why a particular company qualifies as a conservative investment. And as you can see from the names of conservative investment companies above, being a conservative investor can lead to some of the most dependable and respectable returns in the market. \nTrade on the Go.

Additionally, users won’t find many order types beyond basic market and limit orders, which prevents more advanced traders from getting the most out of the system. \nThe flagship CopyTrader and Popular Investor Program features are arguably the highlights of the platform, enabling users to copy the trades of successful traders while the most successful traders earn rewards when their trades are being copied. These offerings, combined with the site's interactive nature, can make the user experience feel more akin to a social media platform than a traditional brokerage service. \nCustom watchlists can be synced between the mobile and web platforms, allowing users to keep track of their interests regardless of which version they use to access eToro. Watchlists can be customized to add volatility alerts that send notifications directly to your phone. \nMobile Trade Experience \neToro’s mobile app is user-friendly, with a simple, uncluttered design. The beginner-friendly user interface combined with the feel of a social media app makes for an innovative, creative user experience. The app is built with interactive functionality so you can engage with other traders and navigate to popular investor profiles. \nBeginner investors may feel more comfortable with the app’s familiar feel since eToro is not modeled on other traditional brokerage offerings. Experienced traders looking to execute orders without the social feel may find eToro to be a bit of an adjustment, but overall the mobile app is very intuitive. \nRange of Offerings \neToro provides a much wider range of offerings on international versions of the experience. The U.S. platform has very limited offerings compared to competitors. There are no mutual funds, futures contracts, or forex on eToro's U.S. platform, and all trading is limited to long positions only—there is no short selling. \nOn eToro U.S., you have access to: \n3 cryptocurrencies\n3,250+ stocks\n270+ ETFs\nCrypto copy trading through CopyTrader\nOptions trading\nCash management through eToro Money9 \nPortfolio automation through Smart Portfolios \nFractional share investing\nOrder Types \neToro only offers a narrow range of order types on its platform. They include market order, limit order, stop-loss order, and take-profit order.10 \nTrading Technology \neToro doesn’t disclose order execution quality statistics, but it has a best execution policy and has a very low level of payment for order flow, suggesting that the broker follows it.11 \neToro’s Smart Portfolios lets you select from diversified automated portfolios so you don’t have to allocate your money yourself. You can invest in a wide variety of portfolios that focus on everything from private equity and infrastructure to technology and health care while blending the allocation of ETFs, stocks, and cryptocurrency. An investment team monitors the portfolio offerings to ensure that they continue to match thematic elements and risk parameters. These portfolios are particularly appealing to beginner investors.12 \nThe trading technology associated with ETF, stock, and crypto trading is relatively straightforward. Charting capability is included with all asset types, but no backtesting capabilities are included on the platform. Beyond that, screening tools and other more robust trading functionalities are largely absent. The CopyTrader product and social trading element remain the focus of eToro’s trading experience. \nCosts \neToro's fees are in line with most other online brokerages and crypto trading platforms. \nCrypto trading incurs a 1% fee for the amount of crypto bought or sold. This fee is added to the bid-ask spread.\nA fee is applied when you transfer your crypto assets from your eToro trading account to your eToro Money crypto wallet.13\nThere are no fees or commissions for ETFs and stocks (ETFs may have their own internal costs).\nThere is a $5 withdrawal fee and a $30 withdrawal minimum. However, this withdrawal fee does not apply to Platinum, Platinum+, and Diamond Club members.14\nWithdrawals and deposits are conducted in USD, and any non-USD transaction fee will incur a conversion fee. Depending on the currency and payment method, the fee can range from 1.5% to 3.0% per transaction.15\nA $10 monthly inactivity fee is applied for users who have been inactive for more than a year.16\nHow This Broker Makes Money From You and For You \neToro makes money by taking the difference between bid and ask prices. This practice is a typical way for brokers to price trades and collect fees, even if a platform notes fee-free or commission-free trading.17 \nCryptocurrency: eToro charges a 1% fee for the amount of crypto assets bought or sold.\nOther platform fees: eToro also charges fees for withdrawals and account inactivity.\nInterest on uninvested cash: On Nov. 29, 2023, eToro announced the launch of an interest on cash feature. Available to eToro Options account holders, the new opt-in program offers 4.9% APR on cash balances and is free for eligible users with an at-rest cash balance of $5,000 or more. Users who opt into the program and maintain a cash balance of less than $5,000 in their account will still benefit from the offering but may be charged a small monthly fee.18\nPayment for order flow: Many brokers generate income by accepting payment from market makers for directing orders to those trading venues. This is called payment for order flow (PFOF). eToro’s PFOF agreement is with a clearing firm called Apex, although a February 2022 F-4 filing with the SEC states eToro does not practice PFOF.1920 The simple translation of the filing is that Apex may collect PFOF and share a portion with eToro, but the broker is focused on execution quality and not PFOF. \nPrice improvement: While eToro has a best execution policy, the company does not provide information on the actual statistics of this program..21\nAccount and Research Amenities \neToro’s beginner-friendly platform enables users to search for and filter assets on its trading dashboard. Stock investors have the option of a simple stock screener, while crypto traders can browse from a menu of available coins or view portfolios of other investors and decide whether to use the CopyTrader feature to automatically copy popular traders. \neToro lacks many of the tools, calculators, and detailed trading functionality that most sophisticated investors would find necessary to carry out advanced trading techniques. \nStock Screener \neToro offers a simple stock screening tool that allows you to filter stocks by a range of criteria. The platform also offers a volatility tracker where you can view the biggest movers. \nETF Screener \nWhile users can sift through a list of eToro’s available ETFs based on proprietary social inputs, there is no option to customize their search with helpful technical or fundamental indicators. \nMutual Fund Screener \nCurrently, there are no mutual fund screener tools are available, as this asset class is not offered on the platform. \nOptions Screener \nCurrently, eToro does not offer the ability to screen option contracts. \nCrypto Screener \nNo crypto screener tools are available. Only the biggest movers of the day and trending assets are highlighted on the platform.22 \nFixed Income Screener \nCurrently, there are no fixed income screener tools are available, as this asset class is not offered on the platform. \nTools and Calculators \neToro has no tools or calculators of note. Goal and financial planning tools are not offered. \nCharting \neToro provides charting capabilities through a professional-grade technical tool, ProCharts. This charting feature helps you analyze an asset’s history and performance by providing line, bar, and candle charts. ProCharts also lets you view two or more charts on the same screen, enabling you to compare their performance. \nProChart users can filter their data by time interval or price. Some more sophisticated tools are available from the chart screen as well, including Fibonacci retracement and accumulative swing index. Users can place trades directly from the desktop chart.23 \nTrading Idea Generators \nCopyTrader provides the extent of trading idea generators at eToro. Users can search for, follow, and copy trades of investors that match their interests and goals. This feature is only available for crypto. \nNews \neToro’s news feed is mainly composed of other eToro users’ analysis, thoughts, and insights, highlighting the social trading network’s social media-esque look and feel.24 \nThird-Party Research \neToro’s third-party research is powered by TipRanks, a leading source for up-to-date recommendations from professional analysts at investment banks and financial companies from around the world. \nFractional Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) \nAlthough eToro has fractional investing, dividends paid out on the platform are not automatically reinvested in your portfolio. eToro credits payment to your cash balance if you hold a position in a stock or ETF that pays dividends.25 \nCash Management \neToro offers cash management through eToro Money, which enables you to seamlessly deposit and withdraw funds to and from your eToro account. You can also use it to send and receive money and store cryptocurrency.26 Additionally, users can earn 4.9% annual interest on their cash through eToro’s High Interest Cash Program.27 Beyond that, eToro’s cash management solution doesn’t provide any further banking-related service to customers in the U.S.\nPortfolio Analysis \neToro provides limited portfolio analysis, especially in comparison to competitor platforms. While you can see current balances and positions clearly, not much exists in the way of further analysis outside of charting features. eToro’s charting capabilities are adequate but give you a better sense of performance as opposed to helping you see where portfolio changes might be needed. \nInvestopedia's latest Reader Survey shows that, despite concerns about the election, inflation, and extended valuations, individual stocks remain survey respondents' the top investment choice if they had an extra $10,000 to spend.\nEducation \nAn online educational portal is accessible through eToro Academy. While many of the articles provide information on cryptocurrency, other materials focus on products like the Smart Portfolio and trading strategies like technical indicators. \nA filter lets you quickly toggle the educational library between beginner and advanced material so that you can customize the experience to your skill level. A variety of educational formats are available as well, with long-form articles and videos as options.28 \nCustomer Service \neToro provides a help center that has a large volume of FAQ articles that address a range of potential inquiries. Outside of this self-serve option, more traditional customer support options are limited. Phone and email support is available, but the contact information is not readily available for you to find. Chat functionality is provided through the help center so you can chat directly with an agent. You can also open a support ticket online. \nSecurity and Reliability \nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) and biometric fingerprint entry\nEquity assets like stocks and ETFs covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash)\nIn addition to SIPC insurance, eToro's clearing partner, Apex, also added supplemental insurance, protecting eToro customers with up to $37.5 million in securities and $900,000 in cash per individual.29 \nA digital wallet, known as the eToro Wallet, is provided by eToro to store cryptocurrency. Users can transfer cryptocurrency from eToro’s platform to their own digital wallet, but they should note that coin transfers are one-way—which means any coins transferred can’t be transferred back to the eToro trading platform. \nTransparency \neToro generally has a transparent platform in terms of pricing but is lacking when it comes to execution statistics. Crypto pricing is explicitly laid out at 1% of all trades. There are no fees for stock and ETF trading, although some ETFs may carry additional expenses on their own. Spread pricing and payment for order flow (PFOF) information is available as well. The inability of users to transfer coins from the wallet back to the eToro trading platform may not be immediately obvious to clients. \nAvailable Account Types \nIndividual brokerage and options accounts are the only types of accounts that can be opened with eToro in the U.S. Joint accounts, retirement accounts, trust accounts, and custodial accounts are not available. Just as notable, eToro doesn’t support margin accounts. This aspect can be a severely limiting factor for users looking to open accounts that are better suited for a wide variety of goals. \nThe Bottom Line \neToro is one of the most established online brokerages offering crypto trading services in the United States. The user-friendly interface and platform’s CopyTrader and SmartPortfolios features further expand on the beginner-friendliness of the platform, making the crypto asset market more accessible for newcomers. \nIn addition to crypto trading, eToro users can also invest in stocks, ETFs, and options, providing a suite of products to choose from. However, the list of tradable assets across all supported asset classes is not as long as at some eToro’s competitors. Moreover, the lack of advanced trading tools, in-depth research, and margin trading makes eToro less suitable for experienced traders looking to deploy advanced trading strategies. \neToro is best suited for beginners and less experienced traders looking to trade the most popular cryptocurrencies (and other assets) as well as make use of the platform’s flagship copy trading feature. However, advanced traders looking to trade cryptocurrency may want to look at popular crypto exchanges to fulfill their crypto needs. \nCompare eToro to Similar Online Brokers \nHow to Buy Bitcoin on the eToro App \nTo buy bitcoin on eToro in the United States, you need to sign up for an account on eToro.com, verify your identity to pass the customer onboarding process, link your bank card to your account to transfer funds, and then purchase bitcoin with the funds you have deposited on the eToro platform. The purchased BTC will then be held on your eToro account, but you can also transfer it to eToro’s official crypto wallet, eToro Wallet. \nIs eToro Safe? \neToro is a licensed online brokerage company with an excellent track record for security. The company’s U.S.-based securities business, under the entity eToro USA Securities Inc., is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and FINRA. eToro’s U.S.-based cryptocurrency business, operating under the entity eToro USA LLC, is a registered Money Services Business (MSB) with FinCEN. Moreover, the company has not reported any major security breaches on its platform. \nHow We Picked the Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms \nProviding readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia. We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards.

  "text": "6 Investment Styles: Which Fits You?\nDo you know what your investment style is? If you're like most investors, you probably haven't given it much thought. Yet, gaining a basic understanding of the major investment styles is one of the fastest ways to make sense out of the thousands of investments available in the market today. \nThe major investment styles can be broken down into three dimensions: active vs. passive management, growth vs. value investing, and small cap vs. large cap companies. Walking through each one and assessing your preferences will give you a quick idea of what investment styles fit your personality. \nActive or Passive Management \nIn determining investment style, an investor should first consider the degree to which they believe that financial experts can create greater than normal returns. \nInvestors who want to have professional money managers carefully select their holdings will be interested in active management. Actively managed funds typically have a full time staff of financial researchers and portfolio managers who are constantly seeking to gain larger returns for investors. Since investors must pay for the expertise of this staff, actively managed funds typically charge higher expenses than passively managed funds. \nSome investors doubt the abilities of active managers in their quest for outsized returns. This position rest primarily on empirical research shows that, over the long run, many passive funds earn better returns for their investors than do similar actively managed funds.1 Passively managed funds have a built-in advantage—since they do not require researchers, fund expenses are often very low. \nGrowth or Value Investing \nThe next question investors must consider is whether they prefer to invest in fast-growing firms or underpriced industry leaders. To determine which category a company belongs to, analysts look at a set of financial metrics and use judgment to determine which label fits best. \nThe growth style of investing looks for firms that have high earnings growth rates, high return on equity, high profit margins and low dividend yields. The idea is that if a firm has all of these characteristics, it is often an innovator in its field and making lots of money. It is thus growing very quickly, and reinvesting most or all of its earnings to fuel continued growth in the future. \nThe value style of investing is focused on buying a strong firm at a good price. Thus, analysts look for a low price to earnings ratio, low price to sales ratio, and generally a higher dividend yield. The main ratios for the value style show how this style is very concerned about the price at which investors buy in. \nSmall Cap or Large Cap Companies \nThe final question for investors relates to their preference for investing in either small or large companies. The measurement of a company's size is called \"market capitalization\" or \"cap\" for short. Market capitalization is the number of shares of stock a company has outstanding, multiplied by the share price.2 \nSome investors feel that small cap companies should be able to deliver better returns because they have greater opportunities for growth and are more agile. However, the potential for greater returns in small caps comes with greater risk. Among other things, smaller firms have fewer resources and often have less diversified business lines. Share prices can vary much more widely, causing large gains or large losses. Thus, investors must be comfortable with taking on this additional level of risk if they want to tap into a potential for greater returns. \nMore risk averse investors may find greater comfort in more dependable large cap stocks. Amongst the names of large caps, you will find many common names, such as GE, Microsoft, and Exxon Mobil.3 These firms have been around for a while, and have become the 500 pound gorillas in their industries. These companies may be unable to grow as quickly, since they are already so large. However, they also aren't likely to go out of business without warning. From large caps, investors can expect slightly lower returns than with small caps, but less risk, as well. \nThe Bottom Line \nInvestors should think carefully about where they stand on each of these three dimensions of investment style. Clearly defining the investment style that fits you will help you select investments that you will feel comfortable holding for the long term.",

  "text": "The Top 5 Ways to Hedge Against Inflation\nInflation is defined by the rate at which the value of a currency is falling and, consequently, the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. Inflation is a natural occurrence in an economy, but inflation hedging can be used to offset the anticipated drop in a currency's price, thus protecting the decreased purchasing power. \nInflation hedging can also help protect the value of an investment. Although certain investments may seem to provide a decent return, they can be sold at a loss when inflation is factored in. \nA disciplined investor can plan for inflation by cultivating asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary climates. Although traditional bonds are the usual go-to for the income-oriented, they aren't the only investment that produces a revenue stream. \nKey Takeaways\nInflation is a natural occurrence in an economy, and a disciplined investor can plan for it by cultivating asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary climates.\nShifting funds from bonds to stocks, especially preferred shares, is one strategy.\nReal estate usually performs well in inflationary climates; REITs are the most feasible way to invest.\nAdding global stocks or bonds to your portfolio also hedges your portfolio against domestic inflationary cycles.\nAnother option is more exotic debt instruments like TIPS (inflation-adjusted Treasury bonds).\nBuying senior secured bank loans is another way to earn higher yields while protecting yourself from a price drop if rates start to rise.\nHere are the top five asset classes to consider when seeking protection from inflation. They range from equities to debt instruments to alternative investments. All are feasible moves for the individual investor to make, though they carry different degrees of risk. \n1. Reallocate Money Into Stocks \nIf inflation returns, it's generally a punch in the jaw for the bond market, but it could be a shot in the arm for the stock market. Consider reallocating 10% of your portfolio from bonds to equities in order to take advantage of this possible trend. \nA 60/40 stock/bond portfolio is considered to be a safe, conservative mix of stocks and bonds. An example of a stock/bond portfolio is the Dimensional DFA Global Allocation 60/40 Portfolio (I) (DGSIX).\nA 60/40 stock/bond portfolio is an easy investment strategy and will help you hedge against inflation, but keep in mind it will underperform over the long term compared to an all-equity portfolio because of the effects of compounding interest. You may find yourself missing out on returns compared to a portfolio with a higher percentage of stocks.\nBuying preferred stocks is another possibility. These liquid issues will pay a higher yield than most types of bonds and may not decline in price as much as bonds when inflation appears. \nUtility stocks represent a third alternative, where the price of the stock will rise and fall in a somewhat predictable fashion through the economic cycle and also pay steady dividends. \n2. Diversify Internationally \nAmerican investors tend to lean towards stocks and bonds in the U.S, but the practice can be costly over the long term, especially during times of inflation. Increasing international exposure can be a good strategy to hedge against inflation. \nThere are several major economies in the world that do not rise and fall in tandem with the U.S. market indices, such as Italy, Australia, and South Korea. Adding stocks from these or other similar countries can help to hedge your portfolio against domestic economic cycles. Bonds from foreign issuers can provide investors with exposure to fixed income that may not drop in price if inflation appears on the home front.1 \nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are two of the easiest options to diversify investments into international markets. These types of funds are a low-cost way to invest, compared to purchasing a portfolio of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) or foreign stocks. If you hold S&P 500 index funds, you may want to consider adding an international index fund to your portfolio. \n21%\nThe percentage of international equities and bonds in the portfolios of U.S. investors, despite the fact that international markets represent 60% of global public capital markets.2 This phenomenon is known as \"home-country bias.\"\n3. Consider Real Estate \nThere are many advantages to investing in real estate. This asset class has intrinsic value and provides consistent income through dividends. It often acts as a good inflation hedge since there will always be a demand for homes, regardless of the economic climate, and because as inflation rises, so do property values, and therefore the amount a landlord can charge for rent.\nBecause real estate is a tangible asset, however, it's illiquid. An alternative to consider is real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are more liquid investments and can be bought and sold easily in the markets. REITs are companies that own and operate portfolios of commercial, residential, and industrial properties. Providing income through rents and leases, they often pay higher yields than bonds. Another key advantage is that their prices probably won’t be as affected when rates start to rise, because their operating costs are going to remain largely unchanged. An example of a REIT with broad exposure to real estate and a low expense ratio is the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ).\n4. Look to TIPS \nTreasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), are a type of U.S. Treasury bond, designed to increase in value in order to keep pace with inflation. Because they’re backed by the U.S. federal government, they’re considered among the safest investments in the world. \nThe bonds are linked to the Consumer Price Index and their principal amount is reset according to changes in this index. TIPS pay interest twice a year at a fixed rate, which is applied to the adjusted principal. The principal rises when there is inflation and falls when there is deflation. TIPS come in three maturities: five-year, 10-year, and 30-year. \nThere are however a few risks that come with TIPS. They are sensitive to any change in the current interest rates, so if you sell your investment before maturity, you may lose some money.\nTIPS' yields have dropped in value in the secondary market considerably since 2018.3\n5. Buy Bank Loans \nSome businesses can thrive during inflation, when prices are rising. Banks, for example, earn more money as interest rates rise and profit off the increased price of loans. \nBuying senior secured bank loans is a good way to earn higher yields while protecting yourself from a price drop if rates start to rise. Keep in mind, though, that there may be a substantial time lag until the value of loans increases as the rates rise. An example fund of this type is the Lord Abbett Floating Rate Fund (LFRAX). \nMany of these investments are complex instruments, and novice investors may be wise to buy them through a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). For example, the Vanguard Global Ex-U.S. Real Estate Index (VNQI) offers broad-based exposure in properties around the world. The iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) tracks the performance of inflation-protected U.S. Treasury bonds. The Lord Abbett Floating Rate Fund (LFRAX) is one good choice for those who seek exposure in lower-grade corporate loans.\nWhat Is Historically the Best Hedge Against Inflation?\nThe best hedge against inflation, historically, depends on your time frame. Commodities are often cited as a good bet for keeping up with the cost of living—especially gold. However, research by Duke University professor Campbell Harvey and Claude Erb, former commodities and fixed income manager at TCW Group, shows that gold works best as an inflation hedge only over the very long-term—a century or more.4\nMany analysts and economists feel equities are a better way to protect your portfolio over the long term, particularly against an unexpected flare-up of inflation. Corporate earnings often grow faster when inflation is higher because this indicates people are spending and the economy is growing. While it has its ups and downs, over the past 100 years, the stock market (as represented by the S&P 500) has appreciated an average of 10% annually.5\nIs Gold a Good Hedge Against Inflation?\nOne of gold's traditional selling points has been its status as an inflation hedge. As an actual, tangible asset, gold tends to hold its value for the most part—unlike paper currencies like the dollar, which lose purchasing power when inflation is rampant.\nWith rising inflation, gold typically appreciates. However, gold isn't a perfect inflation hedge. Other factors can drive its prices, which can fluctuate wildly from year to year—which means its inflation-adjusted returns can too. In fact, over the last 1-, 5-, 10-, 15- and 20- year investment horizons, the variation in the nominal and real returns of gold has not been driven by realized inflation.4\nIs Bitcoin a Strong Hedge Against Inflation?\nTheoretically, bitcoin could be a strong inflation hedge. Assets that investors run to in times of rising prices—so-called safe-haven investments like precious metals and real estate—are ones that are scarce or move counter to paper money or financial assets. Bitcoin fits the bill.\nThe problem is, bitcoin hasn't much of an investment history: Created in 2009, it's only been actively traded for a decade or so, and inflation hasn't been much of a factor for most of its short life.\nSo no one really knows how inflation will affect bitcoin and its characteristically volatile behavior. Certainly, its performance has been puzzling vis-a-vis inflation of late. Bitcoin doubled from mid-December 2020 to early January 2021, as inflation started to heat up. But then, with no apparent easing of inflationary pressures, between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11, it lost 25% of its value.6\nIn May 2021, inflation talk intensified: As the Federal Reserve signaled a retreat from easy-money pandemic policies and a rise in interest rates, stocks trembled—but bitcoin really tumbled. On May 19, it culminated a month-long slide by closing at $38,390—a 41% decline from its peak of $64,829 in mid-April.7\nCan Real Estate Hedge Against Inflation?\nReal estate is one of the time-honored inflation hedges. It's a tangible asset, and those tend to hold their value when inflation reigns, unlike paper assets. More specifically, as prices rise, so do property values, and so does the amount a landlord can charge for rent, so that the property earns higher rental income over time.\nThere's also the phenomenon of “depreciating debt”: that is, the cost of the real estate owner’s mortgage payments actually declines. For example, say your mortgage payments add up to a fixed $8,333 per month during the first year of your loan. They will remain the same nominally—$100,000 annually—but may well only be worth $80,000 in the 10th year, if there's been sustained inflation during that period.8\nAll these elements make real estate valuable protection in inflationary times.\nThe Bottom Line \nInflation happens and is a risk every investor faces. Money tends to lose value over time, and also the level of inflation in an economy changes depending on current events. \nThere are, however, many ways for investors to hedge against inflation, including some investments and inflation-hedged asset classes designed specifically for that purpose. Keeping these assets on your watch list, and acquiring them when inflation hits, can help your portfolio thrive despite the economic climate.\nBuy, Trade, and Hold 350+ Cryptocurrencies\nJoin 120 million registered users exchanging the world's most popular cryptocurrencies.

The program is made up of seven different modules divided into 130 video segments and includes readings, discussion boards, and in-depth lesson quizzes. \nThe comprehensive course requires a time commitment, but the payoff in learning is well worth it. \nWhen you subscribe to Coursera, you can get a seven-day free trial of the platform. During the trial, you can cancel the subscription without having to pay any fees. Once the trial expires, you can continue for $59 per month or $399 per year. Experience in finance or economics isn’t required, but it helps if you can read mathematical equations. The course is self-paced and offered on demand. \nBest for a Free and In-Depth Experience : Coursera - Cryptocurrency and Blockchain : An Introduction to Digital Currencies \nCoursera\nMembership Fees: Free to audit, $50 to obtain a certificate\nLive Instruction: No\nWhy We Chose It \nThis Coursera course is our top choice in this category because it keeps pace with the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space—and it does so in an entertaining fashion. In fact, after taking this course, if you talk about cryptocurrency at a cocktail party, you’ll likely find that people actually listen. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nDepth and breadth of content\nIvy league instructors (and they aren’t boring)\nPresents a serious look at cryptocurrency as an asset class\nFull range of e-learning assets\nWell crafted with high-quality production value\nCons\nHas a philosophical approach (not practical enough for some)\nNo live interaction\nCan be a little overwhelming for people new to cryptocurrency\nOverview \nCryptocurrency gets a negative review from traditional investment experts, so it might be a bit surprising to see a course on the subject constructed by two professors from the University of Pennsylvania. What’s more surprising: The course is highly engaging, informative, and easy to absorb, thanks to the well-crafted modules in the Coursera platform.2 \nWhen you subscribe to Coursera, you can enroll in the course and get a seven-day free trial of the platform. During the trial, you can cancel the subscription without having to pay any fees. After the trial period, you can continue the courses for $59 per month or $399 per year. \nThe course is made up of four modules. One is an introduction to cryptocurrency, another is a study of Bitcoin, a third examines crypto as an asset class, and a fourth looks at blockchain technology. Instructional materials consist of readings, discussion boards, and in-depth lesson quizzes. More than 55,000 students have enrolled already. It has earned a 4.6 rating from students and a 4.76 rating on our quality scale. \nMost Comprehensive Course : Behind the Balance Sheet - Analyst Academy \nBehind The Balance Sheet\nMembership Fees: About $195\nLive Instruction: Yes, Live Q&A\nWhy We Chose It \nAnalyst Academy aims to train people who want to work as professional analysts and portfolio managers (PMs)—or those who want to use analysts’ techniques in their personal investing. Students rave about the course, which covers a wide range of information and shows how to apply tactics in real time. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nSelf-paced materials and live Q&A sessions\nTaught by Steve Clapham, a highly qualified, 30-year industry professional\nComprehensive instruction on concepts from a practitioner's point of view\nCons\nNot inexpensive at about $195 per month\nTopics can get heavy\nNo lifetime access to course, only monthly subscription\nOverview \nBehind the Balance Sheet is an education company devoted to preparing students to work as financial professionals. The company is built around Stephen Clapham, an industry professional who spent years advising multi-billion dollar hedge funds. Considering his wealth of experience and his professional’s understanding of the investment world, the cost for his course is quite reasonable.3 \nProfessional training for only $195 per month is a bargain. One key drawback is that this course doesn’t actually carry the cachet that a chartered financial analyst (CFA), chartered market technician (CMT), or master of business administration (MBA) designation would bring to an interview. Nevertheless, teaching the concepts, lingo, philosophy, and skills needed in the world of analysts and PMs, this course is the best of its kind among those we reviewed. \nThe course covers topics such as: \nUnderstanding different types of investment accounts\nHow to value stocks\nHow to pick stocks to buy or sell\nHow to construct and maintain a professional portfolio\nStudents signing up for the course need to spend several hours each week completing coursework. Students can pace themselves. \nBest for Beginners and Best for General Market Knowledge : Morningstar - Investing Classroom \nmorningstar.com\nMembership Fees: Free\nLive Instruction: No\nWhy We Chose It \nBest for Beginners \nMorningstar’s investor classroom course does not assume a student knows anything about the investing world. Ideal for newcomers to investing, the coursework is practically jargon-free, and it connects students to excellent resources on its website for evaluating stocks and funds. \nBest for General Market Knowledge \nMorningstar has a reputation for objectively classifying and evaluating investments. Operating on the philosophy that a well-educated investor is more likely to be a successful investor, the site offers a wide array of investment tools. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nEasy-to-access, easily digestible courses\nUseful information that is integrated with the company’s evaluation tools\nGreat information from a well-respected brand in the investing world\nCons\nNo certificate of completion or credential offered\nClassroom information is framed in ways that favor Morningstar’s own tools.\nNo interactive help or community support for some of the more complex topics\nOverview \nThe interactive classroom at Morningstar.com offers many self-study courses from a trusted source of knowledge about investing. The course materials are short, easy-to-read documents spread over a few pages, so that the “interactive” experience consists largely of clicking on the “Next” button and taking an occasional multiple-choice quiz.4 \nMorningstar also benefits from providing so much high-quality information for free. Once educated and ready to invest, students will likely use Morningstar products, many of which require paid subscriptions. \nAnd why not? The course materials are sound and easy to access—more so than at all the investment education sites we reviewed. The platform offers instruction in approximately 100 topics. Each topic typically takes around 10 minutes to complete and includes a quiz to help students retain what they've learned. The information is highly regarded by students. Our team gives it a rating of 4.17. \nBest for a Community Experience and Best for Female Investors : Clever Girl Finance - How Investing Works \nClever Girl Finance\nMembership Fees: Free\nLive Instruction: Yes\nWhy We Chose It \nBest for a Community Experience \nCatering to women who want to build their financial futures, Clever Girl Finance is dedicated to supporting women learning about finance through online communities. It supports channels on social media platforms such as Pinterest, X, Facebook, and Instagram and hosts the “Clever Girls Know” podcast on iTunes, Google Play, and Spotify. \nBest for Female Investors \nMany beginning investors need educational resources that do not assume any knowledge of the financial world. Whether it is investing topics or personal finance education, Clever Girl Finance caters to female newcomers who feel uncertain about how to get started but prefer to take the plunge amid a community of like-minded women. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nWoman-led discussions on foundational investing topics\nClear and simple explanations for financial topics\n30+ free courses and other resources available at no charge.\nHigh-quality content\nInvesting strategies also discussed\nCons\nContent serves as a platform for advertisements\nNew investors might find some of the free content is hard to comprehend at first\nOverview \nClever Girl Finance’s “How Investing Works” online course is actually a bundle of seven separate courses. Each course has starter videos, written content, a recorded live coaching call, and more.5 The topics covered include: \nCreate a plan for your future self through investing\nCore investing concepts\nPreparing to invest and researching your investments\nStock market investing\nInvesting for retirement\nMonitoring and managing your investments\nThe 3-fund investing strategy \nThis bundle requires that a student completely new to investing do a bit of study so they can keep up with the material, but there are plenty of other courses, articles, and educational resources on the website (clevergirlfinance.com) to help with this. \nThis bundle is a fantastic progression from ground zero to having a fully viable investing strategy that can be used in a 401(k) account or an IRA. The content is strong and garners a 4.6 quality rating from our metrics. \nBest for Investing in Real Estate : Udemy - The Complete Guide to Multifamily Real Estate Investing \nUdemy\nMembership Fees: $119.99\nLive Instruction: No\nWhy We Chose It \nReal estate investing can be complex; multifamily structures more so, whether they are duplexes, triple-deckers, four-plexes, or bigger apartment buildings. The best low-cost educational course we found, The Complete Guide to Multifamily Real Estate Investing on Udemy, is surprisingly comprehensive and well-produced, providing industrial-grade details on how to identify, analyze, and carry out a multifamily real estate investment. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nHigh-value, comprehensive content on a complex subject\nKnowledgeable, skilled professional giving instruction from his own experience\nOver 80 video lectures, 7.5 hours of content, with downloadable resources\nLow cost, lifetime access\nCons\nSimple slide and lecture format, no high-production video\nNo community or message board resources\nDetails may be overwhelming for novice investors\nOverview \nThis course is dynamite for someone who needs a high-quality information source and is willing to work hard. Creator/instructor Justin Kivel is experienced in this field and it shows in his content. His presentations are engaging and insightful, despite being Powerpoints with voiceovers. For its low cost, it is a high-value resource.6 \nKivel covers a comprehensive list of topics. He gives you information designed to reduce the risks in multifamily real estate investing. Three modules form the core of his course: \nModeling the deal\nMultifamily valuation analysis\nMultifamily acquisition walkthrough\nThese modules (along with 13 others) answer questions you likely never knew you needed to ask. As Kivel states, “Most of what I know today I had to learn on the job.” That is a reality that nearly every real estate investing professional faces. Likewise, most every multifamily real estate investor needs this information. \nThe course presentation is relatively basic, but the information is comprehensive. The course scored 4.58 on our quality scale and got a 4.7 average rating from over 2,800 reviews among nearly 17,000 students who have taken the course. \nBest for Investing in Crypto : Coursera - Cryptocurrency and Blockchain : An Introduction to Digital Currencies \nCoursera\nMembership Fees: Free to audit, $50 to obtain a certificate\nLive Instruction: No\nWhy We Chose It \nThere is no shortage of cryptocurrency education, but there aren’t many courses that approach the topic with unbiased academic rigor the way this course does. This course also delivers it in an easy-to-consume fashion through the Coursera platform, which students praise. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nVery practical evaluation of cryptocurrency\nInstructors who take a serious approach but remain curious instead of arrogant\nWide variety of learning aids \nCertificate of completion\nCons\nPotentially complex for a casual crypto investor or trader\nQuizzes can get a bit heavy\nEvergreen content limits discussion on new or emerging altcoins\nOverview \nIt’s important to understand the evolving crypto universe as more than just an extension of Bitcoin. At the same time, it is important to be able to evaluate Bitcoin alone as an asset. This course covers both of those learning objectives, leaving enough flexibility for students to shift their emphasis based on personal interest.2 \nThe course is not burdensome to complete. Students can hurry through it in about four hours, but there are over 15 hours of material for those who want to take a deeper dive. It is one of the few courses that takes a serious look at considering cryptocurrency a rational addition to an investor’s portfolio. \nWhen you subscribe to Coursera, you can get a seven-day free trial of the platform. During the trial, you can cancel the subscription without having to pay any fees. Once the trial expires, you can continue the courses for $59 per month or $399 per year. There are no prerequisites, but it does help to have a general understanding of traditional finance topics such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and modern portfolio theory (MPT). The course is self-paced and offered on demand. \nBest for Kids : Juni Learning : Money-Minded - Investing in the Stock Market \nJuni Learning\nMembership Fees: $275/month\nLive Instruction: Yes\nWhy We Chose It \nThis program offers youngsters in-depth instruction on how to invest in the stock market, so it is best suited for motivated students. It is the only course we found that includes one-on-one instruction in its teaching approach. \nPros & Cons \nPros\nIn-depth courses, tailored for kids, that can start from zero\nHighly customized lesson plan \nSimulated stock market\nOne-on-one instruction\nProject-based curriculum, focused on desired outcomes\nCons\nCourse takes six months\nRequires focused attention from child\nCostly\nOverview \nThe course is an amazing concept with a stratospheric goal: Tailor individual learning for motivated children between the ages of 9 and 18 and get them to learn and perform meaningful simulated investments within six months. Access to the course comes with individual coaching and a stock market simulator. It comes at a cost of $275 a month ($1,650 for six months) and requires a reasonable time commitment from the child.7 \nThe course cost is not trivial and students must be dedicated. But if a child is interested in learning and mastering investment topics at a young age, there could hardly be a better approach. Most parents would likely agree that the value of acquiring such skills at a young age surpasses the price of the course. \nThe course materials are very good, and they scored a 4.4 on our quality scale. This is a standout program for standout students. \nCompare the Best Investing Courses \nWhy You Should Trust Us \nInvestopedia collected 13 criteria that are critical to investors, from 18 online investing courses. We used this data to review each platform for course structure, costs, available amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best online investing courses since 2020. \nGuide to Choosing the Best Investing Courses \nYour Goals and Investing Style \nInvesting courses certainly do not have the same value for all investors. Just as investors have different goals and investing styles, online learners have a variety of objectives. That’s why it is important for someone who wants a good investing education to clearly define their investment goals. \nFinancial Goals \nWhether it is preparing for a career, saving for retirement, attaining a particular net worth, or building a legacy for future generations, the education you need is characterized by the primary goal you have. When selecting which courses are best for you, consider what you want the material to accomplish. You should also consider what it is worth to you in money and time so that you can make selections that fit with the resources available to you. \nInvesting and Trading Styles \nAll of the education in this review is tailored to various investing styles, primarily with the goal of building career knowledge and skills or planning for retirement. None of these courses feature education on short-term trading—which is different from long-term investing. It is useful for you to distinguish what topics of investing you want help on in your education. It makes a difference whether you want to know about value investing, growth investing, momentum investing, or something else. What assets you want to trade also makes a difference: Do you want to invest in stocks, options, futures, forex, or cryptocurrency? \nOnline courses can be divided into two groups: those that seek to inform you and those courses that also help you gain experience through practice. Courses that are strictly lecture-oriented are great for delivering information you don’t have and maybe didn’t know to ask about. If that’s all you need, this kind of course fits perfectly. \nBy contrast, courses that allow for simulated environments encourage students to try the things they are learning. These are courses specifically designed to help build skills. That’s where defining your goals comes into play. Consider the following list of course types, and see which kind meets your goals. \nOnline presentations: Information-based, with no attempt at skill transfer\nOnline course with practice tools: Designed specifically to help you build skills\nInvestor communities: Typically help with career building via networking, but can also help deepen understanding of concepts through exchanging information with fellow students\nInvestor coaching or mentorship: Designed to help you build a custom-selected skill set at an accelerated pace\nTypes of Investing Courses \nIn-person seminars: Often information-based and usually designed to help you select a customized collection of additional courses for yourself\nSelf-study programs: Designed to be flexible and often include a skill-building component, but the learning must be self-motivated to achieve it\nFactors to Consider When Choosing an Investing Course \nDepending on what kind of courses you need to fit your goals (information-based courses or skill-building courses) you can begin to select them based on additional criteria such as the following: \nCost: Paying anything under $100 for more than one hour of education is considered low-cost, and more expensive courses need to be evaluated for how much benefit they offer.\nDiscounts and promotions: Many course providers offer Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals that are worth considering.\nReviews: You have lots of choices; don’t settle for something poorly reviewed in either quantity or quality.\nComprehensive curriculum: The more comprehensive the course, the more time it takes, so you have to evaluate a tradeoff between comprehensive content and focused skill-building tools. \nExpert instruction: This is highly valuable so long as you don’t pay too much for it. \nInteractive learning tools: This is vital when you want to build skills, but not a high priority if you just need good information.\nReal-world application: This is also useful for skill-building courses, but can improve your retention in information-based courses.\nSupport and community: This element can greatly improve your motivation to take action, which can be very important for skill-building courses,\nHow to Avoid Investing Courses Scams \nThis industry is rife with scams. Organizations developing material to market coursework designed to help people acquire great wealth rapidly should naturally be met with skepticism. The telltale sign of a scam appears when the information you are reading appears to be designed to stir emotions in the reader, more than it seeks to inform the reader. Scams are built to sell people based on strong emotion, not boring facts. If you are suspicious that what you are evaluating might be a scam, notice whether the description includes the following elements. \nAlluring narrative: Does the material seem crafted as an engaging story or more like a list of benefits and costs?\nLengthy and meandering narrative: Educational material that requires you to read material for 15 minutes or longer should make you suspicious. That’s how long it takes for you to build enough curiosity to consider a purchase.\nNon-verifiable information: If you can’t find third-party reviews, or the only confirmation you have comes from carefully crafted testimonials, you might be at a disadvantage in properly evaluating the online coursework. It's best to move on from these.\nWhat Features Should a Good Investing Course Have? \nWorthwhile investing courses should give you the ability to either be well-informed or moderately skilled by the time you complete the course. Here are additional characteristics to look for: \nCredibility (reputable institutions or instructors)\nInteractivity (engaging materials and activities)\nFlexibility (courses that fit your lifestyle and schedule)\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhich Investing Course Is Best for Beginners?\nCourses that don’t assume previous knowledge, keep their information at a basic level, and have practice tools are usually the best-designed courses for beginners. Comprehensive courses with a large amount of content are usually not best for beginners. A beginner needs to become familiar with basic concepts before they can take on a large collection of information. \nWhat Are Some Key Topics That a Good Investing Course Should Cover?\nAmong all possible topics, the three key topics a good investing course should cover include how to:\nDefine a good investment strategy\nValue and select stocks (or other assets).\nCreate a trade plan for your next investment choice.\nHow Should a Beginner Start Investing?\nOnce you have determined your educational needs, it becomes simpler to define your clear action goals and start making practice trades. Beginners should prepare to learn about modern portfolio theory and learn how to construct a portfolio, but then they should practice doing so. This activity takes at least three months to complete. Beginners should complete this, or a similar activity, before risking any money in the marketplace.\nCompanies We Reviewed \nWe researched and reviewed 18 investing course platforms to find the best companies you see in the list above.

  "text": "5 Key Investment Strategies to Learn Before Trading\nAn investment strategy is a set of principles that guides your investment decisions. With seemingly countless theories and approaches on offer, from simplistic learn-this-one-trick pop investing books to dense tomes by financial doctorates filled with statistical tests of long-term financial data, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about where to start. However, by focusing on a few key investment strategies, even beginning traders can lay a solid foundation for long-term success in the market. \nBefore trading, it's crucial to understand the fundamental principles and techniques that have stood the test of time. When properly applied, these strategies have helped many investors manage risks and maximize their returns. Whether you're aiming to build a balanced portfolio, capitalize on market trends, or generate steady income, having a grasp of these trading essentials is vital. \nBelow, we'll explore five key investment strategies that every aspiring trader should learn before entering the market. From value and growth investing to dollar-cost averaging, we'll break down the core principles and advantages of each, giving you a clear understanding of how they work and when to apply them. \nKey Takeaways\nBefore choosing a stock market strategy, thoroughly assess your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. This self-awareness should be the basis of any approach you take.\nPassive index investing involves putting your money into index-tracking mutual or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering built-in diversification and a hands-off approach.\nInvestors who follow growth strategies should review the executive teams of the firms they're investing in and news about the economy and relevant sectors.\nMomentum investors buy stocks trending upward and short sell them since they view them as likely to come back down to earth.\nDollar-cost averaging removes the pressure of trying to time the market perfectly. It's a disciplined approach that involves investing consistently over time, regardless of market fluctuations.\nGetting Started \nBefore choosing an investment strategy, it's important to gather some basic information about your finances. Let's get you started with these important strategic questions: \nStrategic Question 1: How Are Your Finances? \nEven though you don't need much money to start, you shouldn't begin investing until you can afford to do so. If you have debts or other obligations, consider the impact investing will have on your short-term cash flow before you start putting money into your portfolio. \nMost advisors recommend paying down your debts and having a three-to-six-month emergency fund before socking significant amounts into an investment portfolio. As you build toward getting ready to trade, you should sort out how much you can afford to put into your stock market account. \nStrategic Question 2: What Are Your Financial Goals? \nNext, set out your objectives. Everyone has different needs, so you should determine yours. Are you saving for retirement? Are you looking to make big purchases like a home or car? Are you saving for your or your children's education? Answering these questions will help you narrow down a strategy since each approach requires different levels of liquidity, opportunities, and risk. \nEnsure you can afford to invest before you start putting money away. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt, for example, before setting money aside for the future.\nStrategic Question 3: What Is Your Risk Tolerance? \nNext, figure out your risk tolerance. This is determined by answers that can be put into numbers and some that can't. First, there's your age, income, and how long you have until retirement. Investors who are younger have time on their side to recuperate losses, so it's often recommended that younger investors hold more risk than those who are older. \nYour risk tolerance is also highly psychological and deeply personal. People who grew up in the same home and have very similar experiences and income can have very different reactions to specific financial situations. How would you feel if your investments dropped 30% overnight? How would you react if your portfolio is worth $1,000 less today than yesterday? Sometimes, the best strategy for making money could make you deeply uncomfortable. Your investment strategy will need to align with where your comfort level ultimately is. \nStrategic Question 4: Can You Handle Market Volatility? \nRelatedly, you'll need to be able to handle the ups and downs of the market. Alyson Claire Basso, a managing principal of Hayden Wealth Management in Middleton, Massachusetts, told us she makes it a point with her clients \"to discuss past market experiences and potential future market volatility. This way, they feel prepared and know that volatility is something we’ve planned for.\" This discipline is important when thinking about investment strategies. \"We talk about their financial goals and how sticking to their plan can help them ride out the rough patches. I also remind them that diversified investing helps spread out risk, so they're not putting all their eggs in one basket.\" \nOnce you've answered the strategic questions above, you'll want to learn the basics of investing: how to read stock charts, etc., and then begin picking some of your favorite companies and analyzing their financial statements. You'll also need to keep up to date with recent news about industries you're interested in investing in. It's a good idea to have a basic understanding of what you're getting into so you're not investing mindlessly. \nRisk isn't necessarily bad in investing. Higher-risk investments are often rewarded with higher returns. \"A holistic financial plan balances threats, opportunities, risks, and rewards,\" said Neil R. Waxman, a managing director of Capital Advisors in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Waxman emphasized the importance of understanding how risks and rewards can be balanced while providing cash flow to those who need it. \"A client who understands these connections and has a clear game plan\" will have \"the perspective and vision needed to be a patient investor.\" \nStrategy 1: Passive Index Investing \nPassive index investing has gained significant popularity since the introduction of passive index-based mutual funds in the 1970s and then similar ETFs in 1993. Unlike actively managed funds, where an individual or team makes decisions on the underlying assets in an attempt to beat the market, passive mutual funds and ETFs track an index like the S&P 500; they don't work to beat the market so much as match it. \nSince the S&P 500, an index of the 500 largest publicly traded American companies, has been up over time, this has been a winning strategy for many investors. Below is a chart of the percentage of large-cap domestic equity funds that have underperformed the S&P 500 since 2001: \nIn addition, the hands-off approach means fund managers charge lower fees given the less work required vs. active management. The passive investing strategy has the benefit of lower turnover. When assets move in and out of the fund at a slower pace, it results in fewer transaction costs and realized capital gains, which can lead to potential savings when tax filing season arrives. \nPros and Cons of Passive Index Investing\nPros\nLower costs because of minimal trading, research, and management fees\nSimplicity and ease of implementation through passive funds\nBroad diversification across multiple sectors\nPotential for long-term growth in line with the market\nGreater flexibility for investors to execute a buy-and-hold strategy\nCons\nCan't outperform the market\nExposure to market downturns and volatility\nMissed opportunities in specific sectors or regions\nReliance on the performance of the underlying index or sector\nPotential for tracking errors (lack of a perfect match in performance) between the fund and the underlying index\nWho Benefits From Passive Index Investing \nPassive index investing can be a great choice for beginner investors starting to explore the stock market. It's an ideal entry point for those who may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the financial markets. Investing in index funds or ETFs that track broad market indexes allows you to gain exposure to a diverse range of companies and sectors without the need for extensive research or stock-picking skills. \nBut this isn't just a rookie move: experienced investors also invest heavily in such funds, which now make up about half of all volume traded in mutual and exchange-traded funds combined.1 Long-term investors benefit greatly from passive index investing, particularly those saving for retirement or other distant goals. The buy-and-hold nature of passive index investing allows investors to ride out short-term market fluctuations and benefit from the power of compound growth over time. In addition, the lower fees of passive investing can lead to significant savings over time. \nStrategy 2: Value Investing \nPros and Cons of Value Investing\nPros\nThere's long-term opportunity for large gains as market prices meet up with a company's true intrinsic value.\nValue companies often have stronger risk/reward relationships.\nValue investing is rooted in fundamental analysis and supported by financial metrics.\nValue companies are more likely to issue dividends as they aren't as reliant on cash for growth.\nCons\nValue companies are often hard to find.\nSuccessful value investments take time, and investors must be more patient.\nEven after holding long-term, there's no guarantee of success since the company may even be in worse shape than before.\nInvesting only in sectors that are underperforming decreases your portfolio's diversification.\nValue investors are your bargain shoppers of the investing world. They look for stocks with prices they believe don’t reflect the security's intrinsic value. Value investing is premised, in part, on the idea that some degree of irrationality exists in the market. This irrationality, in theory, presents prospects to get a stock at a discounted price and make money from it. \nIt’s not necessary for value investors to comb through volumes of financial data to find deals. Thousands of value mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer shares in baskets of stocks thought to be undervalued. For example, the Russell 1000 Value Index is a popular benchmark for value investors, and several mutual funds track this index. \nFor those who don’t have time to perform exhaustive research, the price-earnings ratio (P/E) is an often-used measure for quickly identifying undervalued or cheap stocks. The metric derives from dividing a stock’s share price by its earnings per share (EPS). Value investors seek companies with a low P/E ratio; a lower P/E ratio means you’re paying less per $1 of current earnings. \nFor a nuanced guide to using the P/E ratio to evaluate stocks, see Investopedia's Are Stocks With Low P/E Ratios Always Better? \nWho Benefits From Value Investing \nValue investing is best for investors looking to hold their securities long-term. If you're investing in value companies, it may take years (or longer) for the businesses to scale up. Value investing focuses on the big picture and often attempts to approach investing with a gradual growth mindset. \nPeople often cite legendary investor Warren Buffett, who sees himself as the epitome of a value investor. Consider Buffett’s words when he made a substantial investment in the airline industry. He explained that airlines \"had a bad first century.\" Then he said, \"And they got that century out of the way, I hope.\"2 This illustrates much of the value investing approach: choices are based on decades of trends and with decades of future performance in mind.\nA rich set of academic studies has found that value investing can produce superior returns over the long term.3 However, value investing has had periods where it has underperformed growth investing, especially when tech stocks have posted outsized price gains.45 \nStrategy 3: Growth Investing \nPros and Cons of Growth Investing\nPros\nGrowth stocks and funds aim for shorter-term capital appreciation. If you make profits, it'll usually be quicker than value stocks.\nOnce growth companies begin to grow, they often experience the sharpest and greatest stock price increases.\nGrowth investing doesn't rely as heavily on fundamental analysis and can be easier to begin investing in.\nGrowth companies can often be boosted by momentum; once growth begins, future periods of continued growth (and stock appreciation) are more likely.\nCons\nGrowth stocks are often more volatile. Good times are good, but if a company isn't growing, its stock price will suffer.\nDepending on macroeconomic conditions, growth stocks may be long-term holds. For example, increasing interest rates works against growth companies.\nGrowth companies rely on capital for expansion, so don't expect dividends in the short term.\nGrowth companies often trade at high multiples of earnings; entry into growth stocks may be higher than entry into other types of stocks.\nRather than look for low-cost deals, growth investors want investments that offer strong upside potential for future earnings. It could be said that a growth investor is often looking for the “next big thing.” However, this strategy isn't a reckless embrace of speculative investing. Instead, it involves evaluating a company's health and potential to grow. \nA drawback to growth investing is a lack of dividends. When a company is growing, it often needs capital to sustain its expansion. This doesn’t leave much (or any) cash left for dividends. Moreover, with faster earnings growth comes higher valuations, which are, for most investors, a higher risk proposition. \nWhile there is no definitive list of hard metrics to guide a growth strategy, there are a few factors an investor should consider. Growth stocks tend to do comparatively well during periods of falling interest rates, as newer companies find it less expensive to borrow to fuel their expansion. It's essential to keep in mind, however, that at the first sign of a downturn in the economy, growth stocks are often the first to get hit.6 \nGrowth investors also need to carefully consider the management of a business’s executive team. Achieving growth is among the most difficult challenges for a firm. Therefore, a stellar leadership team is required. You'll also need to evaluate the competition. A company may enjoy stellar growth, but if its primary product is easily replicated, the long-term prospects are dim. \nWho Benefits From Growth Investing \nGrowth investing is inherently riskier and generally only thrives during certain economic conditions. Investors looking for shorter investing horizons with greater potential than value companies are best suited for growth investing. Growth investing is also ideal for investors not concerned with investment cash flow or dividends. \nAccording to a study from New York University’s Stern School of Business, “While growth investing underperforms value investing, especially over long periods, it is also true that there are sub-periods, where growth investing dominates.”57 The challenge, of course, is determining if these “sub-periods” are occurring. While trying to time the market is often unwise, growth investing is most suitable for investors who believe strong market conditions lie ahead. \nBecause growth companies are generally smaller and younger with less market presence, they are more likely to go bankrupt than value companies. It could be that growth investing is better for investors with higher disposable income as there is more downside for the loss of capital than other investing strategies. \nStrategy 4: Momentum Investing \nPros and Cons of Momentum Trading\nPros\nHigher risk means higher reward, and there's greater potential short-term gains using momentum trading.\nMomentum trading is done in the short term, and there's no need to tie up capital for long periods of time.\nThis style of trading can be seen as simpler as it doesn't rely on bigger picture elements.\nMomentum trading is often the most exciting style of trading. With quick price action changes, it is a much more engaging style than strategies that require holding securities long term.\nCons\nMomentum trading requires a high degree of skill to properly gauge entry and exit points.\nMomentum trading relies on market volatility; without prices quickly rising or dropping, there may not be suitable trades to be had.\nDepending on your investment vehicles, there's increased risk for short-term capital gains.\nLosses can happen very quickly; without notice, an entry and exit point may no longer exist and you're stuck with the losses coming your way.\nMomentum investors ride the wave. They believe winners keep winning and losers keep losing. They look to buy stocks experiencing an uptrend. Because they believe losers continue to drop, they may choose to short sell these securities. \nMomentum investors are heavily reliant on technical analysis. They use a strictly data-driven approach to trading and look for patterns in stock prices to guide their purchasing decisions. This adds weight to how a security has been trading in the short term. \nMomentum investors act in defiance of the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that asset prices fully reflect all information available to the public. A momentum investor believes that given all the publicly disclosed information, there are still material short-term price moves that can be taken advantage of. Despite some shortcomings, momentum investing has its appeal. Consider, for example, the MSCI World Momentum Index, which has averaged annual gains of 10.75% since its inception in 1994 through June 2022, compared with 7.59% for its benchmark over the same period.8 \nWho Benefits From Momentum Investing? \nTraders who adhere to a momentum strategy must always be at the switch and ready to buy and sell. Profits build over months, not years. This contrasts simple buy-and-hold strategies that take a \"set it and forget it\" approach. \nIn addition to being heavily active with trading, momentum investing often calls for a skilled ability to use technical analysis. Momentum investing relies on data for proper entry and exit points, and these points are continually changing based on market sentiment. For those with little interest in watching the market closely there are momentum-style ETFs.\nStrategy 5: Dollar-Cost Averaging \nPros and Cons of Dollar Cost Averaging\nPros\nDCA can be combined with the other strategies mentioned above.\nDuring periods of declining prices, your average cost basis will decrease, increasing potential future gains.\nDCA removes the emotional element of investing, requiring reoccurring investments regardless of how the markets are doing.\nOnce set up, DCA can be incredibly passive and require minimal maintenance.\nCons\nDCA can be difficult to automate especially if you are not familiar with your broker's platform.\nDuring periods of declining prices, your average cost basis will decrease, increasing your future tax liability.\nYou must have steady, stable cash flow to invest to DCA.\nInvestors may be tempted not to monitor DCA accounts; however, investments—even automated ones—should be reviewed periodically.\nDollar-cost averaging (DCA) is when you make regular investments over time, as when you set aside part of your paycheck for your 401(k). It can be and often is used with the other strategies above. However, the point of this is discipline: even if the market is going down or you're most worried about investing, you still put away a set amount periodically. This means you benefit when stocks are low and you can buy more with the same amount of funds.9 \nThis disciplined approach becomes particularly powerful when you use automated features that invest for you. The benefit of the DCA strategy is that it avoids the market timing strategy, which can be painful and ill-fated for many people. Even seasoned investors occasionally feel the temptation to buy when they think prices are low, only to discover that their market timing was wrong. \nWhen investments happen in regular increments, you capture prices at all levels, from high to low. These periodic investments effectively lower the average per-share cost of the purchases and cut the potential taxable basis when you sell later on. \nWho Benefits From Dollar-Cost Averaging? \nDCA is a wise choice for most investors. It keeps you committed to saving while reducing the level of risk and the effects of volatility. Most investors are not in a position to make a single, large investment. A DCA approach is an effective countermeasure to the cognitive bias inherent to humans. New and experienced investors alike are susceptible to hard-wired flaws in judgment. \nLoss aversion bias, for example, causes us to view the gain or loss of an amount of money asymmetrically. In addition, confirmation bias leads us to focus on and remember information that confirms our long-held beliefs while ignoring contradictory information that may be important. DCA circumvents these common problems by removing human frailties from the equation. \nYou must have ongoing cash flow and reoccurring disposable income for a workable DCA strategy. Many online brokers have options to set up reoccurring deposits. You can adjust them based on changes in your personal cash flow or investment preference. \nYou've Picked Your Stategy, Now What? \nSuppose you've narrowed down a strategy; great! There are still a few things you'll need to do before you make the first deposit into your investment account. First, figure out how much money you need to start investing. This includes your upfront investment and how much you can continue investing. \nYou'll also need to decide on the best way for you to invest. Do you intend to go to a traditional financial advisor or broker, or is a passive, worry-free approach better for you? If you choose the latter, consider signing up with a robo-advisor. \nConsider your investment vehicles. Cash accounts can be immediately withdrawn but often have the greatest consequences. Accounts like 401ks can't be touched until you retire without fees and have more limited options, but your company may match your investment. Different types of IRAs also have various levels of flexibility. \nIt also pays to diversify. To reduce the risk of one type of asset bringing down your entire portfolio, consider spreading your investments across stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and alternative assets. If you're socially conscious, you may consider responsible investing. Now is the time to figure out what you want your investment portfolio to be made of and what it will look like. \nHow Do I Set Up an Investment Strategy?\nA general investment strategy is formed based on your long-term goals. How much are you trying to save? What is your timeline for saving? What are you trying to achieve? Once you have your financial goals in place, you can set target performance on returns and savings, then find assets that mesh with that plan.\nFor example, your goal may be to save $1 million. To reach this, you need to invest $10,000 per year for 29 years and achieve 8% annual returns. Armed with this information, you can analyze various historical investment performances to try and find an asset class that achieves your strategic target.\nWhat Is Warren Buffett's Investment Strategy?\nWarren Buffett has long been widely regarded as among the world's most skilled and successful investors. Warren Buffett's investing strategy is based on the principles of value investing. He focuses on identifying undervalued companies with strong fundamentals, consistent earnings, and competitive advantages (which he calls \"economic moats\"). Buffett believes in long-term investing, holding stocks for many years or even decades. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding the businesses he invests in and only investing within his \"circle of competence.\" Lastly, Buffett prefers companies with strong management teams, low debt, and the ability to generate high returns on invested capital.10\nHow Does Risk Tolerance Affect an Investment Strategy?\nRisk tolerance is the amount of risk that an investor is willing to endure. It plays a significant role in determining the type of investment strategy that someone chooses and how much they opt to invest. Investors with longer time horizons might be more willing to take on a riskier investment, while investors focused on a short-term financial goal might be more risk-averse.\nWhat Is the Safest Investment Strategy for Earning High Returns?\nThere's always a risk-return trade-off. In other words, the safer your investments are, the lower the expected returns over time (and vice versa). That said, there are ways to maximize investment returns while minimizing risk. One effective approach is to create a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities.\nBy spreading your investments across different sectors and industries, you can cut the impact of any single investment's performance on your overall portfolio. This helps to mitigate unsystematic risk, which is the risk associated with individual companies or sectors. A good way to follow this strategy is to use low-cost index funds or ETFs and follow the model of modern portfolio theory. This provides for a passive long-term portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk.\nWhat Is the Least-Risky Thing to Invest In?\nCash is, by definition, the lowest-risk asset since it cannot incur a loss ($1 always = $1), but it will lose purchasing power because of inflation over time. U.S. Treasurys are also considered one of the safest investments, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Treasurys have various maturities, ranging from short-term Treasury bills (T-bills) to longer-term Treasury notes and bonds.\nWhile Treasurys are generally considered risk-free in terms of default risk, they are still subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds declines, as newer bonds are issued with higher yields.\nThe Bottom Line \nHow you choose your strategy may be more important than the strategy itself. Indeed, any of these strategies can generate a significant return if the investor makes a choice and commits to it. It is essential to choose because the sooner you start, the greater the effects of compounding. \nRemember, don’t focus exclusively on annual returns when choosing a strategy. Take the approach that suits your goals, income, and risk tolerance. With a plan in place and your goals set, you'll be on a prudent long-term investment journey.",

  "text": "10 Timeless Rules for Investors\nBob Farrell spent decades as the head of research at Merrill Lynch, establishing himself as one of the leading market analysts on Wall Street. His insights on technical analysis and general market tendencies were canonized as \"10 Market Rules to Remember\" and have been distributed widely ever since. Here, we review these timeless axioms and how they can help you achieve better returns. \nKey Takeaways\nInvestors should keep in mind that prices never stay the same and corrections are inevitable. \nExcesses are never permanent and try using stops to take the emotion out of trading.\nDon't go with the herd, but remember that fear and greed need to take a backseat to discipline. \nConsider alternative indexes to watch the health of the market.\nTake expert advice and forecasts with a grain of salt.\n1. Markets Return to the Mean Over Time \nWhether they face extreme optimism or pessimism, markets eventually revert to saner, long-term valuation levels. According to this theory, returns and prices will go back to whence they came—reversion generally puts the market back to a previous state. So when it comes to individual investors, the lesson is clear: Make a plan and stick to it. Try to weigh out the importance of everything else that's going on around you and use your best judgment. Don't get thrown by the daily chatter and turmoil of the marketplace. \n2. Excess Leads to an Opposite Excess \nLike a swerving automobile driven by an inexperienced youth, we can expect overcorrection when markets overshoot. Remember, a correction is represented by a move of more than 10% of an asset's peak price, so an overcorrection can mean bigger movements. During a market crash, investors are presented with really great buying opportunities. But they tend overcorrect in either direction—upward or downward—and trading can happen at unbelievable levels. Tuned-in investors will be wary of this and will possess the patience and know-how to take measured action to safeguard their capital. \n3. Excesses Are Never Permanent \nThe tendency among even the most successful investors is to believe that when things are moving in their favor, profits are limitless. That's just not true, and nothing lasts forever—especially in the financial world. Whether you're riding market lows which represent buying opportunities, or soaring at highs so they can make money by selling, don't count your chickens before they've all hatched. After all, you may have to make a move at some point, because as the first two rules indicate, markets revert to the mean. \nMarkets always revert to the mean.\n4. Market Corrections Don't Go Sideways \nSharply moving markets tend to correct sharply, which can prevent investors from contemplating their next move in tranquility. The lesson here is to be decisive in trading fast-moving markets and to place stops on your trades to avoid emotional responses. \nStop orders help traders in two ways when asset prices move beyond a particular point. By determining a specific entry or exit point, they can help investors limit the amount of money they lose, or help them lock in a profit when prices swing in either direction. \n5. Public Buys Most at the Top and Least at the Bottom \nThe typical investor reads the latest news on their mobile phone, watches market programs, and believes what they're told. Unfortunately, by the time the financial press gets around to reporting a given price move, that move is already complete and a reversion is usually in progress. This is precisely the moment when John Q decides to buy at the top or sell at the bottom. \nThe need to be a contrarian is underlined by this rule. Independent thinking always outperforms the herd mentality. \n6. Fear and Greed: Stronger Than Long-Term Resolve \nBasic human emotion is perhaps the greatest enemy of successful investing. But whether you're a long-term investor or a day trader, a disciplined approach to trading is key to profits. You must have a trading plan with every trade. You must know exactly at what level you are a seller of your stock—on the upside and the down. \nKnowing when to get out of a trade is far more difficult than knowing when to get in. Knowing when to take a profit or cut a loss is very easy to figure in the abstract, but when you're holding a security that's on a quick move, fear and greed act quickly to separate you from reality and your money. \n7. Markets: Strong When Broad, Weak When Narrow \nWhile there's much to be gained from a focus on popular index averages, the strength of a market move is determined by the underlying strength of the market as a whole. So broader averages offer a better take on the strength of the market. That's why it can pay off to follow different indexes—at least those that are beyond the usual suspects like the S&P 500. \nConsider watching the Wilshire 5000 index or some of the Russell indexes to get a better appreciation of the health of any market move. The Wilshire 5000 index is composed of nearly 4,000 U.S-based companies that are traded on an American exchange and whose pricing is available to the public.1 Russell indexes like the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 are weighted by market cap and also give investors exposure to the U.S. stock market.2 \n8. Bear Markets Have Three Stages \nMarket technicians find common patterns in both bull and bear market action. The typical bear pattern, as described here, first involves a sharp sell-off. During a bear market, prices tend to drop 20% or more. In most cases, bear markets involve whole indexes. This kind of market is generally caused by weak or slowing economic activity. \nThis is followed by what's called a sucker's rally. Investors can be drawn into the market by prices that jump quickly before making a sharp correction to the downside again. These rallies, which can be a result of speculation and hype, don't last very long. But who are the suckers? The investors, of course. They're called suckers because they may buy on the temporary highs, but end up losing money when asset prices drop. \nThe final stage of the bear market is the torturous grind down to levels where valuations are more reasonable and a general state of depression prevails regarding investments overall. \n9. Be Mindful of Experts and Forecasts \nThis is not magic. When everyone who wants to buy has bought, there are no more buyers. At this point, the market must turn lower. Similarly, when everyone who wants to sell has sold, no more sellers remain. So when market experts and the forecasts are telling you to sell, sell, sell—or buy, buy, buy—be sure to know that everyone is jumping on that bandwagon, so much so that there's nothing left to sell or buy. By the point you jump in, something else is likely to happen. \n10. Bull Markets Are More Fun Than Bear Markets \nThis is true for most investors since prices continue to rise during these periods. Who doesn't love seeing their profits rise? Well, unless you're a short seller. A short sale is when you sell an asset that you don't own yourself. Traders who use this strategy sell borrowed securities hoping the price will drop. The seller must then return an equal amount of shares in the future. \nThe Bottom Line \nNo one said investing was easy. There's a lot at stake, and so much to take in. Whether you're a novice trader or someone who's been watching the markets for a great deal of time, it's easy to get caught up in the swings of market news, emotions, and the free-for-all of the market. But if you follow Bob Ferrell's time-tested secrets, you may just come out a winner in the end.",

  "text": "Investopedia's Guide to Watching 'Billions'\n\"Billions,\" the hit series from CBS's Showtime network, ran for seven seasons before the series finale aired in October 2023.1 The show, which debuted in 2016 as the brainchild of veteran TV writers Bryan Koppelman and David Levien, takes us deep into the opulent and cutthroat world of hedge funds, white-collar criminals, and prosecutors willing to cross the line to catch a whale.2 \nThe series follows billionaire hedge fund king Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis from the hit \"Homeland\"),3 the show’s main protagonist, and founder of Axe Capital, on his endless pursuit of an edge to tilt the capital markets in his favor. For the first three seasons, Axe, as he is called, is relentlessly pursued by U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti, of \"Sideways\" and \"John Adams\" fame).4 Rhoades' wife, Dr. Wendy Rhoades (Maggie Siff)5 just happens to be Axe Capital's in-house psychologist, which, to say the least, complicates matters. \nKey Takeaways\n\"Billions\" is a series about a billionaire hedge fund king who's constantly trying to tilt the capital markets in his favor.\nThe show exposes viewers to the genius and dirty tricks of hedge fund managers, as well as the relentless pursuit of these managers by U.S. attorneys.\nIt offers a look into the way financial markets work at the extremes, and how the system is played by its richest participants.\nThe series is laden with investing and financial terminology.\nGlossary of Terms for Watching \"Billions\" \n\"Billions\" exposes viewers to the genius and, as some would have it, dirty tricks, of hedge fund managers who weave their portfolio trading strategies around financial regulators, insider trading, corporate actions, and more. It also tracks the relentless pursuit of these hedge fund titans by U.S. attorneys, who sometimes bend the law themselves in order to gain an edge and win their cases. \nThe show is laden with investing and financial terminology, which makes it irresistible for us. It offers a fascinating look into the way financial markets work at the extremes, and how the system is played by its richest participants. We don't want you to miss any of the nuances of the plot, so here is a glossary to keep you up to speed: \nA \nActivist investor: An individual or a group of individuals who purchase large quantities of a company’s stock in an attempt to gain control of a sizable number of the company’s voting seats. By so doing, the activist investor can replace management or put pressure on it to significantly change its operational strategies with a view to driving the share price up. For example, Bobby Axelrod buys a 4.9% ownership stake in YumTime Bakeries in order to force management to fire the incompetent CEO and to eliminate corporate inefficiencies which were costing shareholders for the past eight years, all while executive compensations had soared 300% over the same time period.\nAlpha: The excess return that a hedge fund earns relative to the performance of a benchmark index or risk-free investment. Alpha is used to measure how well a fund manager performs. In simple terms, if a portfolio has an alpha of +5, it means that it outperformed the S&P index by 5%. A negative alpha signifies underperformance. In episode three of season 4, Axe gets his hands on Taylor's holdings and stock positions. Wendy convinces him to start bidding up those stocks in order to generate more buying momentum in them, and then sell to 'capture the alpha.'\nB \nBedrocks: These are stocks poised to increase in value in the long term. Bedrock stocks are characterized by large market capitalizations and cash flow. Their growth spurt eventually slows down after years of growth, at which point they become income investments. Mundia-Tel was considered a bedrock until it filed for bankruptcy, causing a downward spiral in the telecommunications sector. Axe received information from a Mundia-Tel insider, Constantine, about the impending disaster before the bankruptcy was made public.\nBellwether stock: A trendsetting stock that is representative of its sector. A bellwether leads its respective sector in that if its price rises, its sector follows suit, and if it falls in price, the sector declines as well. When telecom giant Mundia-Tel filed for bankruptcy, a domino effect ensued, which saw the stocks of the entire telecommunications sector crashing.\nBips: This term is short for basis points (BPS). Bonds are usually quoted in bips. One basis point equals 0.0001 or 0.01%. A bond yield that goes down from 1.07% to 1.02% is said to have moved down by 5 bips.\nBlue chip: These are well-known companies that are stable and reliable, even in market downturns. Many of the products and services these companies sell are high-quality and in high demand. Blue-chip companies are those that have been around for a long time and are often multinational corporations like Coca-Cola, Walmart, IBM, and General Electric.\nBlock trade: A private, large buy or sell order submitted for 10,000 shares of a security or a block of shares with a market value of at least $200,000.\nBreakout trade: A technical trading strategy that involves buying or shorting a stock after its price moves outside its defined support or resistance level, usually followed by heavy trading volume and an increased amount of volatility.\nBucket shop: In the financial industry, a bucket shop is a pejorative term for an investment firm that deals mainly in speculation, gambling, and making bets on stocks and commodities. Axelrod referred to Krakow Capital as a bucket shop.\nBull and bear: A bull market is characterized by a trend of rising prices in the capital market. Its name comes from the way a bull attacks its target by lowering its head and horns and upon contact with its victim, swinging its head up, so as to throw its victim in the air. A bear market is one that is in decline. It is likened to a bear, which attacks its prey by making a swift downward swipe of the paw.\nBurn rate: The rate at which a company or company division—research and development (R&D), for example—spends or loses money.\nBuyout: An investment move that occurs when a company purchases a controlling percentage of shares in a target company, in essence buying out the target company.\nC \nChurning: An illegal trading practice that involves a trader executing excessive trades in clients’ accounts in order to generate commissions.\nCooking the books: A fraudulent accounting act that involves tweaking the numbers on a company’s financial statement to make the company look more profitable than it actually is to investors or to avoid paying higher taxes.\nCurrency devaluation: A purposeful lowering of the value of a country’s currency relative to another currency within a fixed exchange rate system. When Axe met with Everett Wright with the intention of poaching him from Richards Capital, Wright mentioned that the Nigerian government was going to devalue its currency (the naira) against the U.S. dollar due to its weaker than reported oil industry results. Wright also suggested that taking a large short position in the naira—betting against the naira—could devalue the currency much sooner than it would happen if they waited for the Nigerian government to do it.\nCut bait: A financial term that implies walking away from an investment. Sometimes, investors get too attached to a security. Even when it's losing money, they keep hoping for a price reversal. Cutting bait—selling the losing position and bailing out—could mitigate the investor’s losses and clear funds to be used for a new investment.\nD-E \nDead cat bounce: A brief recovery in the price of a declining stock or bear market, followed by a resumed downtrend.\nDistressed debt: The debt of companies or municipalities that have filed for bankruptcy or have a high chance of filing for bankruptcy in the near future. Marco, Bruno’s cousin, pitched an investment in distressed bonds to Axe. The distressed entity issuing the bond was a small town called Sandicot, which was selling the bond for pennies on the dollar. There were talks to start developing the town—specifically, building a casino—which was sure to bring in more traffic and investment. The casino license ended up not coming through and the distressed investment became worthless. Though very risky ventures, if distressed entities turn around, the returns could be large.\nEvent-driven strategy: A hedge fund strategy that takes advantage of securities that become mispriced for a short period of time after a corporate action such as an earnings announcement, dividend declaration, merger, or bankruptcy notification. Likewise, an event-driven macro play is a strategy whereby a trader exploits short-term movements in securities that are sensitive to macroeconomic movements such as interest rates, commodity prices, or foreign-exchange fluctuations.\nExpense account: A corporate account from which funds are withdrawn to reimburse employees for expenses they incurred while conducting business.\nF \nFamily office: A private, boutique, advisory company that manages the wealth and financial affairs of the fund manager, their family, and/or a number of the fund’s employees. Family offices don’t manage money for external or outside investors and are exempt from regulations under the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. A hedge fund could voluntarily convert into a family office to avoid the onerous compliance costs and regulatory scrutiny that haunt hedge fund managers, or to avoid the pressure of meeting a certain benchmark for quarterly returns. A hedge fund could also be forced to wind down to a family office by regulators, as a penalty for unscrupulous trading practices. As part of his plea deal with the U.S. Attorney’s office—and to avoid a prison term—after he was found guilty of insider trading using Arcadia Railroad shares, Steven Birch agreed to convert his firm to a family office.\nFDA approval: In most cases, when a new drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the stock price of the pharmaceutical or biotech company that won the approval soars, resulting in enormous gains for shareholders. Drugs newly approved by the FDA are called blockbusters—hedge funds are constantly on the lookout for such potential blockbusters. Donnie Caan, a trader at Axe Capital, fell under the U.S. Attorney’s radar when he made large-volume trades in a biochem company called Rubinex. Shortly after he purchased the stock, the FDA approved the company’s organic pesticide, leading to a surge in Rubinex's share price and millions of dollars in profits for Axe Capital.\nH \nHedge funds: A pool of funds raised from accredited and high-net-worth investors, used to create a portfolio managed using a range of alternative strategies. The difference between a hedge fund and a mutual fund lies primarily in the extent of the employable strategies. Axe Capital is a hedge fund run by Bobby Axelrod.\nHedge fund managers: The name comes from the term hedging, and hedge fund managers like Bobby Axelrod are hired to reduce risk, regardless of how the market performs. Hedge fund managers use various investment techniques to provide the highest possible return for their investors, while at the same time reducing risk. The genius of a hedge fund manager lies in the ability to mix strategies to completely eliminate unsystematic or diversifiable risk from the portfolio(s) without taking away from returns. Investment strategies and vehicles used by hedge fund managers include—but are not limited to—stocks, currencies, fixed income securities, leverage, shorts, swaps, options, futures, and forwards.\nHedge fund compensation: This is what hedge funds and their traders are paid. Hedge funds use a fee structure called 2 and 20 to determine their compensation for managing an investor’s funds. The two refers to a 2% annual management fee that is paid out of an investor’s assets under management (AUM). The 20 refers to the 20% performance fee that fund managers take. Different hedge funds have different fee structures. At Axe Capital, the fee structure is three and 30. This means that an investor who has $4 million dollars with Axe Capital will be charged $120,000 (3% of AUM) at year-end as compensation for the firm managing his or her funds. In addition, a $10 billion hedge fund like Axe Capital, with, say, 20% returns, will have booked $2 billion in profit for its investors at year-end, which means that $600 million (30% of the profit) is the manager’s to keep.\nHigh-frequency trading (HFT): An automated trading technique that uses computers running complex algorithms to analyze the markets for price discrepancies, then executing a large number of orders at high speeds.\nHolding company: A company that provides no services or products, but holds the controlling interest in a number of other companies. The business of a holding company is to hold assets in other companies with active operations.\nI-L \nInsider information: This is non-public information about a company that, if acted upon, could be financially advantageous to the investor or trader. People who work in a company or have close links to employees of a company may be privy to insider information, which by itself is not illegal until the information is used to buy or short stock for a profit.\nIPO: An initial public offering (IPO) refers to when a company goes public for the first time. Its shares are offered to the public to raise capital for the firm and to give all market participants an opportunity to purchase ownership stakes in the firm.\nLock-up period: A time frame within which hedge fund investors cannot redeem or sell their shares. Lock-up periods can be three months or longer, depending on how liquid the shares making up the fund or portfolio are.\nLong: A buy position taken on a security, with the expectation that the price will increase in the future. A long position is the opposite of a short position.\nM \nMargin call: This is a broker’s notification to an investor or trader to top up their margin account, thus bringing it up to the minimum required level. A margin account typically allows the account holder to borrow up to 50% of the equities in the account. The broker also requires the account holder to maintain a certain level of value in the account, typically in cash or securities, to act as a buffer against unfavorable price movements. If the value of the holdings drops below this maintenance level, the investor would receive a margin call from his broker. Failure to deposit more cash or securities into the delinquent account may lead to a liquidation of the investor’s shares up to the amount needed to bring the account value to the minimum maintenance requirement. Following an increase in the price of his short position in Cross-Co. Trucking, which pushed his account value below the maintenance level, Axelrod’s friend, Freddie Aquafino, received a margin call from his broker, telling him to top up his account by morning.\nMarket correction: A temporary reversal in the direction of the market trend seeking to adjust for under- or overvaluation of stocks. When the market is perceived to be overvalued, a temporary decline in prices is called a market correction. Recognizing that the decline is a correction, savvy hedge fund managers take advantage of the temporarily lower prices by buying low.\nMergers and acquisitions (M&A): This refers to the marriage of two companies for various reasons like positive growth, lower operational costs, diversification, greater competitiveness, etc. When two companies announce a merger, the acquiring company normally sees a decline in its stock price, while the target company sees an appreciation of its stock price. This is because most companies typically offer a premium to acquire another firm. This leads to an increase in demand for the target company’s stock until the price increases to match the premium offer. When Axelrod was informed of a pending acquisition of Lumetherm Power by Electric Sun at a price of $41, Lumetherm was trading at $35. If Axe used only this information, he could have bought Lumetherm then and there for $35, and waited until the information became public, at which time demand for the target company would have soared and Axe Capital would have sold when the price hit $41. Two million shares invested in Lumetherm pre-announcement would have translated into a $12 million gain post-announcement.\nMosaic theory: An analytical investment method that involves analyzing bits of information received from multiple sources to make investment recommendations. The sources of information could be public databases as well as nonmaterial, nonpublic sources.\nMuni bond: Munis—short for municipal bonds—are bonds issued by a municipality or county in order to finance their capital expenditures. These are attractive to many investors because they're tax-exempt at the federal and state levels. In simple terms, muni bonds are loans given by investors to the government in exchange for interest payments.\nN-O \nNon-compete clause: A restrictive employment contract, whereby a trader agrees not to start or take a job with a company that directly competes with the hedge fund should that trader part ways with it. The non-compete agreement would usually specify the time frame for the employee's restriction from joining a firm competing with a current hedge fund employer—say, nine months after termination of employment. On April 23, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a rule banning non-compete clauses across the U.S., making existing non-competes unenforceable for the majority of workers.6 Existing non-competes for senior executives can still be enforced under the new rule, but employers cannot issue any new non-competes for any employee, including senior executives.\nNon-solicitation agreement: An employment contract in which a trader or analyst agrees not to solicit the hedge fund’s clients and investors in the event that they resign or are terminated from the job.\nOverage: In a lease agreement, an overage is the percentage of sales that is paid to the landlord of a store in addition to the monthly rent payments. Axelrod agreed to pay the overage charges of a pizzeria shop as a favor to the owner Bruno, to prevent Bruno from getting squeezed by his new landlord.\nP \nPare a position: A risk-management tactic that involves reducing the position held in a company's securities to reduce exposure to risk. The number of shares of a specific company held in a portfolio can be pared, just like the total exposure to equities or fixed income in a portfolio may be pared. For example, a portfolio with 50% equity can have its position pared to 30% equity in order to reduce stock exposure should fundamentals decline. Mafee proposed to pare Axe Capital’s position on BioLance to reduce its risk exposure to a pending special-announcement call that could turn out to be negative for BioLance's stock price. If he pared his exposure to the company's stock, and the announcement call turned out to be negative, Axe Capital could have still earned 10%. Since the paring wasn’t done, and the announcement call was a notification that BioLance’s Type II diabetes inhibitor was denied approval by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Axe Capital lost close to $1 billion on its investment position.\nPonzi scheme: An investment fraud that involves refunding money and distributing earnings to existing investors out of funds raised from new investors. The investors are unaware of the Ponzi scheme and have been made to believe that the company is a real money management firm generating high returns on their investments.\nPrime broker: An investment bank offering concierge services to hedge funds in the form of securities lending for short sales, margin provision, trade order execution, and custodianship of securities. Spartan-Ives is Axe Capital’s prime broker. When Axe Capital was being squeezed out of its short position on Cross-Co Trucking, Spartan-Ives threatened a margin call to protect itself from any further increase in the stock price. Remember that to carry out a short, the hedge fund has to borrow the shares from its broker, then sell them in the open market.\nPrisoner's dilemma: A game theory hypothesis in which two individuals make decisions out of their own self-interest, and find themselves in a worse predicament than if they had cooperated with each other. When Peter Decker, CEO of Quaker Ridge Financial, was brought into the U.S. Attorney’s office for alleged insider trading on Pepsum Pharmaceutical, Chuck Rhoades implied that if Decker cooperated with him, the penalty doled out would be lighter than if Decker sought to protect himself and was eventually found guilty.\nPrivate Equity: Private equity is an alternative investment class and consists of capital that is not listed on a public exchange. Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity. Institutional and retail investors provide the capital for private equity, and the capital can be utilized to fund new technology, make acquisitions, expand working capital, and bolster and solidify a balance sheet. \nPublic filings: Financial statements submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by public companies and insiders, to be made available to the public.\nPyramid scheme: A fraudulent investment scheme, whereby money brought into the firm by new investors is distributed to existing investors as profit generated. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, the investors in a pyramid scheme are in on the scheme and are motivated to refer new clients to the company.\nQ \nQuant fund: An investment fund in which securities are selected using numerical and statistical methods rather than human analysis. Axelrod mentions that a decline in returns on his hedge fund was due to a rise in the number of quant funds.\nQuants: In season 3, Taylor Mason interviews several quant traders to see if any of them have the ability to outthink the firm and deliver higher returns. Quantitative traders use a blend of mathematics, computer algorithims, and complex models to create and implement trading strategies faster and more effectively than humans.\nQuote stuffing: A market manipulation technique that involves traders placing a large number of buy and sell orders and then canceling the orders almost immediately in an attempt to throw off other market participants, who rely on market depth data. Quote stuffing creates a false sense of a security's demand, supply, and liquidity, and is mostly carried out by high frequency traders (HFT).\nR \nRaider: An activist investor who initiates a hostile takeover of a company with the intent of generating huge profits after the takeover. A raider is typically uninterested in the long-term prospects of the target firm post-acquisition, but is rather interested in increasing the value of the target company’s price in the short term, selling an ownership stake at the ramped-up price, and then selling off the company's assets in chunks or en masse. Hutch Bailey III of YumTime Bakeries accuses Axelrod of being a corporate raider when Axelrod buys a large stake in the company to push Bailey out, owing to the latter's incompetence as CEO.\nRally: An increase in the price of a security or securities in a bull or bear market within a specific period of time, due to a significant rise in demand for the security.\nRevenue sharing: The distribution of operating profits and losses among partners and select stakeholders in a business firm or project. After three of Axe Capital’s employees left the firm to start their own fund, Lonosphere, they ran into serious investment losses from a poor trade made on the basis of misinformation. One of the conditions Axelrod stipulated in exchange for bailing Lonosphere out required that the two parties enter into a revenue-sharing agreement.\nRisk-averse investor: An investor who doesn’t like to take risks on investments. A risk-averse investor would rather earn lower returns with known risks than earn higher returns with unknown ones.\nRobber baron: A wealthy individual who accumulated wealth from unscrupulous or dishonest means. Sandy Belsinger, the CEO of Giving Oath, informed Bobby Axelrod that his bid for an NFL team was rejected because he was considered a robber baron.\nS \nSEC: The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) exists to regulate securities market transactions and the activities of financial professionals in order to ensure fair, transparent, and efficient trade practices.\nSecurities and wire fraud: A Ponzi scheme, whereby funds are solicited and received from unwitting investors, and wired to the accounts of earlier investors, as if in exchange for providing legal investment services. In a securities and wire fraud scheme, $1 million is received from investor Z who is promised an annual return of 12%. From Z's $1 million, Investor X, who also invested $1 million dollars with a guaranteed return of 12% a year earlier, will have $120,000 wired to his account as evidence that his investment was profitable. Meanwhile, investor Y wants all her money that was invested six months prior refunded back to her, which was $500,000 in total. This money is taken from investor Z’s investment and wired to Y’s account.\nSharpe ratio: A ratio of return to risk that measures how an investment or portfolio performs. The Sharpe ratio is important to investors who want to know the level of return they get for taking on a certain level of risk. A high Sharpe ratio indicates that the investment is generating high returns compared to the level of risk exposure. When Axelrod went to an institutional investor with the intention of raising capital for his fund, the investor wanted to know the reason for Axe Capital's low Sharpe ratio.\nShell corporation: A legally registered company with little to no assets, providing no services or products. A shell company may be set up for legal or illegal purposes. They may be set up and used to hide business dealings and ownership from authorities. They may be used for startups, to get financing, or—in illegitimate cases—for tax evasion or money laundering.\nShort: A position taken in a security in which the shares are borrowed, sold, and then bought back. A short position is the opposite of a long position—the long position being the mode through which people invest in securities most of the time. In a long position, one buys a stock in hopes that the price increases, so it can be sold for a profit. In a short position, one sells a stock in hopes that the price decreases, so it can be bought back at the lower price for a profit. When Axelrod got wind of a faux merger between Lumetherm and Electric Sun, he advised his traders to short Lumetherm. It was trading at $35 but Axelrod believed it would drop to $32. The price actually dropped to $31.19, the trader covered the short, and Axe Capital made $18 million on the short strategy.\nShort squeeze: This is an event that occurs when a stock price increases, forcing short sellers to exit and close out their short positions, so as to cut their losses. The scramble to buy back shares forces the prices to go even higher, due to the perceived higher demand. In his defense for throwing the hedge fund manager of Piedmont Capital, Steven Birch, under the bus, Bobby Axelrod claimed that Birch short-squeezed him out of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) the previous year. This basically means that Axelrod took a short position on the HMO sector with the expectation that the sector would crash, while Birch took a long position and bought HMOs in large enough quantities to increase the HMOs' stock prices, thereby squeezing Axelrod out of his short position. Chuck Rhoades Sr., the U.S. Attorney’s father, similarly tried to squeeze Axe out of his short position on Cross-Co Trucking by pumping the stock’s price.\nSocially responsible investing: An ethical investment strategy that focuses exclusively on the securities of companies promoting certain environmental and societal values. Investors who pursue socially responsible investing often put their money into green companies and avoid sin stocks like alcohol, tobacco, and gambling companies as well as those involved in the sex industry.\nSophisticated investor: An investor with the requisite knowledge and investing experience allowing them to understand the risks of an investment vehicle.\nSovereign wealth fund: A country’s reserve fund, used to invest in projects that will benefit the country. The funding for an SWF comes from central bank reserves which is built up from budget and trade surpluses.\nSpinoff: A type of divestiture in which a company splits and sells new shares of a part of its business in order to create a new and independent company. These new entities are spun off with the expectation that they would be more profitable on their own rather than part of the original company.\nSpike: In technical trading, a spike indicates abnormal buy or sell activity in a stock, which creates a large increase or decrease in the direction of the price, all within a short time period. In the pilot episode, Ari Spyros shares with U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades his findings about a days-long buying spike in Pepsum Pharmaceuticals stock, triggered by the trading activity of three small funds possessing insider information guiding them as to when to buy and sell the stock.\nSubprime mortgage: A type of mortgage issued to high-risk borrowers with poor credit. The interest rate on a subprime mortgage is higher than the prime rate. Subprime mortgages were largely responsible for the housing market crash that led to the financial crisis. Lenders relaxed their lending practices, offering mortgages to those with low credit scores with no down payment and rarely any proof of income. When values dropped, many borrowers defaulted on their obligations, leaving banks scrambling.\nT \nTakeover: A takeover occurs when an acquiring company buys a majority stake in the target company in order to assume full control of the latter. A takeover can be of the welcome or hostile variety.\nTrade by appointment: This refers to stocks or options that are not frequently traded, and are hence illiquid. A seller looking to dump his shares of a company that trades only occasionally and by appointment will find it very difficult to find a buyer.\nTrade on margin: In short, this means trading with borrowed money. Hedge funds borrow money from their prime brokers to be able to buy more securities than they normally would be able to.\nTreasury bids: The U.S. Treasury uses an auction process to sell Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). An auction is normally announced, detailing how much money the government intends to raise and the day and time by which all bids should be submitted. On the auction day, the non-competitive bids are filled first, followed by the highest bids from the competitive tenders. Lawrence Boyd of Spartan-Ives was investigated for Treasury bid-rigging by the US Attorney’s office. This could mean that his hedge fund submitted bids using multiple accounts in order to gain a larger controlling portion than the maximum limit of 35% allowed. The reason for setting a bidding limit of 35% of the bonds or notes issued is so that no firm with a winning bid can have a monopolistic position on the Treasury securities. It could also mean that Boyd colluded with other hedgies to keep the bids at a certain price so that the securities could be resold at higher prices to investors.\nTwo and twenty: Hedge funds typically charge their clients 2% of assets under management, and keep 20% of the returns. In Season 3, Axe has been forced to relinquish trading but convinces another hedge fund owner to trade on his behalf, but on Axe's terms, which are one and 10.\nW-Z \nWindow dressing: The deceptive act of selling stagnant or losing stocks and purchasing strong stocks prior to issuing quarterly financial statements, in order to give the appearance of solid investment management throughout the reported quarter.\nYear-to-date (YTD): The period from the first day of the calendar year or fiscal year up to the present day. When talking to Wendy Rhoades, Axe Capital’s psychologist, trader Mick Danzig mentioned that he was down 4% YTD, which means that from January 1st of that year to the present day of the same year, his returns as a portfolio manager constituted –4%.\nZero-cost collar: A short-term options trading strategy that hedges against the risk of an unfavorable movement in the price of a security. The strategy combines the purchase of a put option and the sale of a call option in order to protect the maximum downside of the underlying security or shares. Mafee is having trouble selling five million shares of Bluudhorn Steel on the market at $40, because the shares are illiquid. His analyst intern, Taylor Mason, proposes going into a zero-cost collar strategy to buy $40 put options and sell $45 call options. Since one option has 100 shares underlying it, Mafee will need 50,000 options on each side. Both options will have the same cost or premium—say, $5 per option. Selling the call gives him $5 per option, which he would then use to purchase the puts, also at $5 per option. Thus, there’ll be no out-of-pocket costs for the trader, since one option funds the other. If the price of Bluudhorn Steel drops below $40 at the expiration date, Mafee still has the right to sell the shares at the put strike price of $40, as per the put options contract, thereby protecting him from the price drop. The call options would expire worthless at a below-$40 price, since the call options buyer on the other end of the contract would be better off buying the shares at the reduced price, on the market, rather than buying at the $45 strike price.\nBuy, Trade, and Hold 350+ Cryptocurrencies\nJoin 120 million registered users exchanging the world's most popular cryptocurrencies.

  "text": "How To Talk Like An Investor\nWhen it comes to understanding the long and short of investing, most beginning investors must learn what seems like a new language. In fact, the phrase \"the long and the short of it\" originated in financial markets. \nIn this article we discuss several key terms that will help you better understand and communicate with other market participants. These terms are used in the equities, derivatives, futures, commodities and forex (or currency) markets. You will learn what buying, selling, and shorting really mean to investors and how they can use certain terms interchangeably with more confusing words like bullish and bearish. To compound the issue, options traders add in a few other terms such as \"writing a contract\" or \"selling a contract.\" When you start to communicate about the markets more comfortably, you will be better informed and can make wise investment decisions. \nLong Positions and Shorting \nThe financial markets allow you to do a few things that are really common in everyday life and a few things that aren't. When you buy a car, you own that car. In the stock market, also known as the equity market, when you buy a stock, you own that stock. You are also said to be \"long\" on the stock or have a long position. Whether you are trading futures, currencies or commodities, if you are long on a position, it means you own it and hope it will increase in value. To close out of a long position, you sell it. \nShorting will likely seem somewhat foreign to most new investors, because shorting a position in the equity market is selling stock you don't actually own. Brokerage firms allow speculators to borrow shares of stock and sell them on the open market, with the commitment to eventually return the shares. The investor will then sell the stock at the day's price in the hope of buying it back at a lower price while pocketing the difference. Catalog companies and online retailers use this concept daily by selling a product at a higher price, and then quickly buying it from a supplier at a lower price. The term originates from a situation where a person tries to pay a bill but is \"short\" on funds. \nYou may be interested to know that some people consider shorting to be unpatriotic or \"bad form.\" The phrase \"don't sell America short\" was attributed to John Pierpont Morgan Sr. (J.P. Morgan).1 The debate against short selling rages on to this day. \nThe Currency Caveat \nWhen trading foreign currencies in the \"spot\" market (currencies and many commodities are traded in the futures or spot markets), you are usually long one currency and short another. This is because you are exchanging one currency for another and therefore, various world currencies trade in pairs. \nFor instance, if you think the U.S. dollar is going to rise but the euro is going to fall, you could short the euro and be long on the dollar. If you feel the dollar is going to rise and the Japanese yen will fall, you could be long on the dollar and short on the yen. \nBullish vs. Bearish \nOther terms that are often new to beginning investors are \"bullish\" and \"bearish.\" The term bullish is used to describe a person's feeling that the market will go up, while bearish describes a person who feels the market will go down. The most common way people remember these terms is that a bull attacks by ducking its head and bringing its horns upward. A bear attacks by swiping its paws down. \nChicago is the home of commodity and futures markets; coincidentally, the professional basketball team is the Bulls and the professional football team is the Bears. The Chicago Cubs' mascot is a bear cub. \nIt is also common for investors to use the terms \"long\" or \"short\" to describe their market sentiment. Instead of saying they are bullish on the market, investors may say they are long on the market. Similarly on the downside, investors may say they are short on the market instead of using the term bearish. Either term is acceptable when describing your market sentiment. It is important to remember that short and long usually imply that you have a certain position in whatever market you are trading but, as you can see, this isn't always the case. \nCalls vs. Puts \nThe derivative market is also known as the options market. Options are contracts in which one party agrees to buy or sell a certain security (security is a generic term for any financial product) at a set price and set time from or to another party. Options are very common in the equities market but are also used in the futures and commodities markets. The forex (or currency) market is known for very creative derivatives known as \"exotic options.\" \nFor our purposes, we'll refer to options in the stock market since it is most investors' first introduction to derivatives. \nOptions come down to calls and puts. \nCall options give the contract buyer the right to purchase stock shares at a set price on or before a set date. Usually another investor will sell a call contract, which means they believe the stock will stay flat or go down. The person who buys the call is long on the contract, whereas the person who sells the contract is short. \nA put option allows the contract buyer to sell stock at a set price before a set date. Like a call option, there is usually another investor willing to sell the option contract, which also means that investor believes the stock will either stay about the same price or rise in value. So the person who buys the option contract is long on the contract and the person who sells the contract is short. \nSelling options while using the derivative dialect also gets more complicated because, not only do they use the terms \"sell\" or \"short\" regarding the contract, option traders will also say they \"wrote\" a contract. Today, the contracts are standardized and no one really \"writes\" the contract, but the term is still very common. \nCovered calls are often one of the first option strategies investors learn—these involve the purchase of a stock and the sale of a call contract at the same time. The purchased stock acts as \"collateral\" in case the call is exercised by the option buyer and the seller can relinquish the shares while keeping the premium gained for selling the option. Since investors are buying a stock and selling a call at the same time, they use a \"buy-write\" order. \nThe Bottom Line \nAt this point, you may find yourself going back to reread some of the vocabulary that was just discussed. Let's do a quick recap. Investors will either say they are bullish, or long, on the market—or bearish, or short, on the market. If we are long one currency in the forex spot market, we are short another currency at the same time. This can be confusing but not nearly as confusing as the options market. \nIn the options market, we can say we are bullish on a stock and then short a put because while being bullish, we can either buy a call or sell a put. We can be bearish on a stock and be long on a put because if we are bearish, we can either buy a put or sell a call. This may also mean that we are short on the market by going long on a put or long the on market by shorting a call. You can imagine the linguistic laughter that comes from a group of option buyers talking to each other. \nIn many cases, and not just in the financial world, overcoming the language barrier will be one of the vital keys to success. Investing carries with it its own language barriers that must be broken down by translating the terms and subduing the syntax. \nBuy, Trade, and Hold 350+ Cryptocurrencies\nJoin 120 million registered users exchanging the world's most popular cryptocurrencies.

  "text": "4 Tips for Joining an Investment Club\nIf you are interested in learning about the stock market and how to take control of your money, it's worth considering joining an investment club. These are groups of people who pool their money to make joint investments, usually in stocks or bonds. Their primary motivation is to make the most money possible, but investment clubs are also a great way to share ideas and learn about the market. \nBut before you join one, there are a few things to consider. \nKey Takeaways\nInvestment clubs offer individuals a chance to learn hands-on about the stock market in a social atmosphere.\nMost investment clubs require an initial payment to the pool and a modest monthly contribution going forward.\nInvestment club members need to pick a club that invests in their preferred style and at their preferred risk level.\nHow Are Investment Clubs Set Up? \nInvestment clubs have been around for decades as a way for people with modest amounts to invest to partake in larger investments and get first-hand experience and education. They are social groups at heart, with members sharing and debating ideas. \nAn investment club should be set up as a legal partnership or a limited liability company (LLC) consisting of 10 to 20 members. Once it is legally established, standardized accounting records must be established for it. This provides members with the confidence that the money they contribute is not being misused and the record-keeping that will be needed for tax purposes.1 \nMonthly Activities \nAfter an initial lump sum contribution, a member will be required to make a monthly contribution to the pot, usually about $80. Since new members may join and others cash out at any time, the club must have a way to calculate each member's share of the assets at any given point in time. \nNew clubs need to establish a brokerage account in the club's name. Shopping around for a suitable brokerage firm is a good idea, The lower the fees the better it is for the club's membership.1 \nAn investment club needs to hold meetings at least monthly. These meetings can be fun and insightful. Members take turns presenting a stock, fund, or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that they think the club should consider buying. Staying in touch by email or text between meetings keeps the club members involved and informed. \nTips for Joining an Investment Club \n1. Think Long Term \nDon't buy stocks through an investment club if your time horizon is a year or less. Trying to make money over a shorter period of time is a bad approach for beginner investors and for clubs. A short time horizon requires quick buy and sell decisions that investment clubs can't handle. \nHaving a three- to five-year horizon is a better outlook. It's also better for the club, which is not set up for constant membership churn. \nIn fact, most investment clubs specify rules or penalties for early withdrawal from the club. Most specify a liquidation price, or early-withdrawal penalty, which members must pay when withdrawing their funds. \nSome investment clubs do not pool club members' funds. The members invest their own funds following the club's decisions.\n2. Define Your Investing Style \nJust as individual investors vary greatly in investment style, such as value investing or income stock strategies, so do investment clubs. \nEvery club needs to have a clearly defined investment style, ideally with some quantifiable rules or limitations on the club's investment portfolio. For example, an investment club might specify that members can propose only stocks that have a minimum share price or market capitalization. Or, the club might place sector restrictions on portfolio choices to ensure diversification. \nIt is also useful for a new investment club to set standardized criteria for reviewing a stock for potential purchase. That gives club members some experience in equity analysis and provides a rational basis for presentations. \nGoing Forward \nOnce an investment club has determined its style, every member must be aware of the club's investing style and willing to follow those guidelines. A club can go off the rails if some members want to invest club funds in risky penny stocks while others gravitate towards blue chips. \nIf you are starting the club, make sure every member understands and supports the club's approach. If you join a club, ensure its style meets your needs. If it doesn't, another club probably does. \n3. Join a Club Association \nThe National Association of Investors Corporation (NAIC), also known as BetterInvesting, offers support and information for people wishing to join or start their own investment club in the United States. \nThe NAIC provides excellent tools and publishes a monthly investor-learning magazine. For membership packages, visit the BetterInvesting website here. \nAccording to NAIC data, the number of investment clubs registered with the association has seen strong growth in the early 21st century, and about half of all registered clubs have outperformed the S&P 500. That's a level of returns most mutual funds are unable to achieve consistently. \nIn the U.K., ProShare Investment Clubs offers resources such as newsletters, online portfolio tools, a message board for members, and an investment club manual. In Canada, the Investors Association of Canada (IAC) offers in-depth newsletters on personal finance education, discounts on books, and the like. \n4. Always Value Education \nThe main goal of an investment club is to make money for its members but education is another good reason to join. Clubs that operate with the goal of educating their members will find that profits naturally follow. \nThe educational aspect is arguably more important. If an investor has no interest in developing investing skills and knowledge, investing in a fund or hiring a full-service broker can provide a reasonable return without the commitments and activities inherent in an investment club. \nAn investment club should also focus on ensuring that all members receive a relatively equal level of educational value from their membership. In fact, it is a good idea to assess a club's level of member expertise before you decide to join. This ensures there is a reasonable match with your own skill level. Also, all club members should participate equally; some members will naturally carry more of a leadership role than others, but if some members do not contribute periodically to the club's meetings, the atmosphere of the entire club is likely to suffer, decreasing the value everyone receives from their membership. \nShould I Join an Online or an In-Person Investment Club\nIt's your choice. Today's investment clubs are often hybrids, forming with a core of like-minded neighbors but meeting virtually for convenience. The non-profit BetterInvesting association has tips for getting set up online.\nHow Many Members Should an Investment Club Have?\nMost investment clubs have eight to 12 members, although a few grow to 20 or more.2\nIt's important to keep the club relatively small. It gives everyone a voice and an opportunity to participate. A larger group can spend more time arguing than decision-making.\nIn addition, the larger clubs tend to buy and sell too many stocks too frequently, leading to relatively poor results once trading costs are factored in.2\nAre There Specialized Investment Clubs?\nInvestment clubs that specialize in stocks are the best known and probably the oldest, but there are many others.\nReal estate investment clubs have been extremely popular in recent years, due to the latest real estate boom. The interest may well have tapered off as interest rates began to chill the housing market in 2022.\nThere also are business investment clubs, also known as incubators. These clubs specialize in investing in promising new business ideas, pooling their cash for greater impact.\nThe Bottom Line \nInvestment clubs are a great way to ease into investing. Whether you start your own club or join an existing one, you'll find that being a member of a club is an enlightening experience. \nOne of the valuable benefits of an investment club, especially for beginners, is the exposure to different points of view. Hashing out investing ideas with other individual investors on a regular basis can be an enlightening experience.",

  "text": "How to Give Money (and Other Digital Assets) as a Gift\nEveryone loves money, but not everyone feels great about giving it as a gift. But money as a gift can include a range of ideas, from funds for retirement savings to the means to buy exactly what they'd like for themselves. Invested wisely, money can also increase in value over time. \nThe process of giving money as a gift is generally easy. You can even transfer your gift directly from your account to the recipient's account. Here are a few strategies and tips for how to give money or other financial gifts to your loved one. \nKey Takeaways\nA cash gift can provide a range of financial benefits to the recipient.\nMoney can be fairly easy to transfer from one account to another.\nRemember to consider the tax implications of your financial gift for both you and the recipient.\nTraditional investments like stocks, bonds, ETFs, and precious metals are some examples of assets you can also give as gifts.\nYou can also give gifts of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens, and reward card points or miles.\nWhy Money Makes a Good Gift \nMoney can make a good gift for nearly anyone because it can be used for many purposes, from investing to buying a product. You could give a gift of money for many occasions, such as for birthdays, holiday presents, graduation presents or wedding gifts. Money will allow the recipient to get exactly what they'd like instead of what someone else chooses for them. \nA gift of money can help a younger person learn about how money works. They could budget the money and learn about saving and spending strategies. Or they could learn lessons in investing. Ultimately, money can be used to help anyone achieve their financial goals, whether, for example, they are saving for a major purchase or building a retirement account. \nDifferent Methods to Give Money \nTwo main ways to give money are to give it in person or to send it to the recipient online. You could also send money through traditional mail, but this method entails a higher risk that someone may intercept it. Let's look at your options for giving money in more detail.\nGiving Money in Person \nYou can give money directly to someone in several forms using a card or envelope or simply handing over the funds. Here are three ways to give money in person: \nCash Gifts: You can use cash bills to give money in an envelope or in another creative way.\nCheck or Money Order: Using a check or money order adds a bit of security to your cash gift because only your intended recipient can use it. In contrast, anyone who intercepts cash bills can use them.\nGift Cards: Gift cards—also called stored value cards—can be a more personalized way to give money because the money must be used at a specific retailer. So, if you'd like to give someone clothes for a gift, you can get a gift certificate to their favorite store instead of choosing an item they may not like or that does not fit.\nBecause you can generally give money directly as simple cash in a card or as a digital asset through a fast and simple online transaction. So money can make a great last-minute gift.\nSending Money Online \nIf you can't hand the gift to someone in person, you can consider sending the money online.\nUsing Apple Cash: With Apple Cash, you can send and receive funds on your phone with Messages or Wallet. You can choose who you want to send money to and choose the amount.1\nMoneyGram Online Transfer: MoneyGram is an app that can help you send money internationally. You can send currency transfers and easily check exchange rates and fees.2\nWestern Union Online Transfer: You can also use a Western Union transfer to send money abroad. In addition to sending money online, you can use Western Union's app or visit one of its locations.\nOther Money Transfer Apps: You can use many other apps to transfer funds to another account holder if they have the app as well. For example, you can use Venmo or Zelle to send funds to someone and include a note. The recipient can then transfer the funds from Venmo to their bank to use as they like.\nTips for Giving Money \nWhen you give money to someone, you'll want to keep a number of factors in mind. \nSafety Precautions \nGiving money often entails certain risks, such as theft or fraud. To better ensure your money goes to your loved one, you can take some steps to protect it. First, try to avoid sending money in the mail. Thieves often target mailboxes, especially around the holidays. If your card with cash is stolen, anyone can use the cash. \nWhen you send money online, choose a reputable company to make the transfer. Many established money transfer apps like PayPal and Venmo use encryption to reduce fraud and help you send money securely. \nTax implications of Giving Money as a Gift \nBefore you give money as a gift, consider all the tax implications for you and for your recipient. The amount of tax you may have to pay will depend on the value of the gift. Tax implications can include a potential annual gift tax, lifetime gift tax, or capital gains tax. \nAnnual Gift Tax: If your gift is worth more than the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limit, you will be responsible for paying the gift tax. For 2024, you cannot give more than $18,000 (or $17,000 in 2023) without paying taxes on the excess. However, you can give up that amount to multiple people. If you give over that amount, you will need to report it to the IRS using Form 709. The IRS changes the gift tax annual exclusion limit regularly.34\nLifetime Gift Tax: The IRS also limits how much you can give in your life time without incurring a gift tax, although most people do not reach this limit. For 2023, the lifetime gift tax exclusion is $12.92 million. For 2024, that amount is $13.61 million.5 If you have given gifts worth more than this amount over the course of your life, you will be responsible for paying the federal gift tax.6 \nLike the gift tax, this amount is adjusted for inflation each year. If the amount of the estate passed on exceeds the lifetime exclusion limit, the executor of your estate will need to report it and file Form 706. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) more than doubled the lifetime gift tax exclusion, and those provisions are set to expire in 2025.7 \nCapital Gains Taxes: The gift recipient will be responsible for paying capital gains taxes whenever they sell an asset such as a stock or a bond. For 2023 and 2024 tax years, the capital gains tax rate is usually no more than 15% of the gains for individuals.8 \nIf you're giving money in a way that it can increase in value through an investment, you essentially pass on a capital gains tax liability along with the gift. Be sure the recipient understands they may have to pay taxes on gains.\nCreative Ways to Give Money as a Gift \nMoney may seem like an impersonal gift, but there are countless ways to add a special touch, from using a unique package to including a thoughtful message. Try one of these creative ways with your gift: \nInclude a heartfelt note\nFold money creatively\nAttach money to another gift\nCreate a money tree\nAdd money to a personalized gift\nUse a puzzle box for the recipient to solve with the money inside\nCreate a scavenger hunt game with the money as a prize\nOther Ways to Give a Financial Boost as a Gift \nIf you want to go a bit beyond giving money as a gift, you can give digital assets like stocks or bonds. Let’s look at some of the common asset classes that may be suitable to give as digital gifts. \nStocks: Stocks are shares of ownership in a company and they can be gifted that match your recipient’s hobbies, interests, or values. The value of a stock is affected by the company's performance and broader market conditions. \nYou can give someone stocks in several ways, including by: transferring shares from your brokerage account to your recipient’s, using an online app specializing in stock gifting, or gifting shares directly through the company. Anyone who receives stock will need to have their own brokerage account. \nBonds: Bonds are debt issues. You earn a fixed income as the company or government repays the debt with interest. The gift of a fixed-income investment can provide predictable payments with lower risk than other assets like stocks. \nThere are several types of bonds. Corporate bonds generally require a high minimum investment, so many gift-givers turn to U.S. savings bonds. Because they are backed by the U.S. Treasury, savings bonds are considered a low risk investment.9 You can buy a savings bond for as little as $25 from the TreasuryDirect website and then transfer the asset to the recipient’s TreasuryDirect account. \nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled security, which is made up of a basket of different investments. This can be a great alternative to stocks and bonds, which give the recipient a stake in just one issuer. When you give an ETF as a gift, your recipient gains exposure to a particular asset group but with more diversity than buying a single stock. \nNote\nJust like stocks, ETF shares can be transferred from your brokerage account, using an online gifting platform, or directly through certain ETF issuers.\nGold or Silver: Precious metals can be a great way to store value and provide benefits when the economy is unstable. If you want to give a digital gift of gold or silver, you may want to consider gold-focused ETFs or shares in mining companies. You can give bullion, coins, or jewelry. But remember that there are costs associated with delivery, storage, and insurance.\nCryptocurrency: Cryptocurrencies, even with their notorious volatility, can make excellent gifts because the recipient can receive the potential for significant gains without risking their own money. If you’re comfortable giving an asset with a high level of risk, these digital assets are fairly easy to buy and gift to someone else. \nYou can buy assets through a cryptocurrency exchange and then transfer them to your recipient's digital wallet. Some sites offer cryptocurrency gift cards that your recipient can then redeem. The new cryptocurrency owner will need a way to store the keys to the digital gift—the safest of which is keeping the asset offline, where it is less vulnerable to hacking and theft. \nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): An NFT is essentially an online digital file made available for exclusive ownership. Like cryptocurrency, NFTs are highly volatile and speculative investments, with a value that is based exclusively on what another buyer might be willing to pay for it. If you can tolerate the risk, NFTs could make an appealing gift because they are unique collectibles. \nThe general process of gifting an NFT involves buying the asset from a marketplace, then transferring it to the recipient’s NFT wallet. The specifics may differ based on the NFT marketplace you use, which, in turn, vary based on their processes and the types of NFTs that they offer.10 \nCredit Card Rewards Points or Miles: If you are looking for a present for an avid traveler, one digital asset that you could consider is your credit card rewards points or miles. \nWith most types of credit cards, you cannot transfer your rewards or miles directly to someone. Instead, you can redeem the points for frequent flyer miles and then transfer those to your gift recipient. You also may be able to use your points to buy gift cards or other merchandise that you can give as a gift. \nHow Can I Give Money Online Securely?\nUse reputable online transfer services like Apple Cash, MoneyGram, or Western Union to give money online securely. These established companies use encryption to protect your information from fraudsters. Always avoid sending money to someone you do not know.\nAre There Any Tax Implications When Giving Money as a Gift?\nYes, there may be tax considerations depending on the amount and purpose of the gift. You'll want to consider potential taxes like capital gains tax, annual gift tax, and lifetime gift tax. The IRS changes the rates and limits for taxes on gifts each year.\nWhat Are Some Unique Ways to Present Money as a Gift?\nYou can present money as a gift in a variety of fun ways. For example, you can fold money creatively, attach it to another gift, create a money tree, or add it to a personalized gift. You use a puzzle box that the recipient needs to solve to get the money or make a scavenger hunt that ends with the money gift as the prize.\nThe Bottom Line \nYou have myriad options when shopping for a gift, but money is one type of gift that can benefit anyone and can be given in many situations. If you want to give money, consider whether you will give it in person or send it to them online. Keep all the tax consequences of giving money in mind, especially if you are giving large amounts. While giving money may not seem like a personal gift, you can use unique and creative strategies to give your loved one money in a meaningful way.",

  "text": "The Affluent Millennial Investing Survey\nInvestopedia’s Affluent Millennial Investing Survey has revealed that nearly half of affluent millennials say they'll be forced to work beyond retirement age, yet nearly all said their personal or family financial situation will improve over the next decade, making them more optimistic than both their Gen X and Gen Z counterparts. \nThe survey asked 1,405 respondents to share how they view investing, who taught them, and how that education influences where they spend, save, and invest. \nJulie Bang | Investopedia. \nThe results also revealed that despite their greater than average income, affluent millennials are still surprisingly reluctant to enter the stock market. According to the survey, almost 40% of this well-off cohort stated they believe investing is “risky,” with nearly a quarter labeling it “overwhelming.” \nThe Majority of Affluent Millennials Don’t Feel Knowledgeable About Investing \nWhy are affluent millennials so wary of the stock market, despite decades of evidence that investing pays off in the long term? Trepidation about stocks and a lack of knowledge about investing are major factors propelling the investment jitters of the wealthy millennials in our study, despite their median income of $132,000. (Median HHI for millennials as a whole is $69,000, according to the Pew Research Center).1 Our survey revealed that less than half of affluent millennials feel confident about investing and retirement planning. In fact, only 37% of affluent millennials feel knowledgeable about investing at all. \nHigh-income millennials who feel knowledgeable about investing are 5X more likely (73% vs. 14%) to feel very confident in their ability to make their own financial decisions. \nFurther, affluent millennials who consider themselves financially knowledgeable are more likely to associate investing with positive emotions, and less likely to find it intimidating, risky or overwhelming. \nJulie Bang | Investopedia. \n\"It gives me a feeling of control and power,\" said one millennial. \"I feel in charge of my own future by handling my finances correctly,\" said another. \"I love crunching numbers and seeing how I can grow my wealth,\" said a third, suggesting that despite some trepidation to invest, affluent millennials are still seeking a sense of control over their financial futures. \nLow Financial Confidence Manifests in Conservative Investing Habits \nThe study also found that affluent millennials, despite having a longer window to invest and recoup losses, displayed surprisingly cautious investing habits. They are significantly less likely than Gen X to own stocks (37% vs. 47%), but just as likely as Gen X to own bonds (19% vs. 18%), and more likely to allocate their income to a low-yield savings account (21% vs. 16%). \nJulie Bang | Investopedia. \nWhy do affluent millennials display an aversion to entering the market, despite a larger income to work with? Fear of losing money, founded or otherwise, is the main reason people think investing is too risky for them, says Ted Jenkin, CFP®, CEO and cofounder of oXYGen Financial in Alpharetta, Georgia. Indeed, the Great Recession, the gig economy, and the burden of student debt have rendered millennials a cautious generation. Yet their fear is a catch-22: coming of age amidst global financial turbulence alerted them to the importance of avoiding risky financial decisions, but investing could play a crucial factor in making up for the stagnant wages of the post-recession generation. \nSophia Bera, CFP®, of Gen Y Planning says she would tell a millennial hesitant to invest in stocks that “you’re probably already invested in stocks if you participate in your work 401(k) plan. It’s important to have different buckets of money to serve different goals.” \nBishop suggests that clients invest in ETFs instead of individual stocks, because people tend to be too emotional about individual stocks, buying or selling on feelings rather than sound investment decisions. Investing in mutual funds, ETFs and index funds that hold baskets of stocks can help manage risk through diversification. \nMany Still Trust and Hire Financial Advisors \nRaised in an era of economic uncertainty, it’s no wonder many millennials with money (to lose) seek professional advice. 43% of the affluent millennials surveyed said they use a financial advisor: and those who consider themselves knowledgeable about investing are more than 2X as likely to have a financial advisor than their less knowledgeable peers. Notably, 27% of those who reported using a financial advisor said their investments perform extremely well— double the number of affluent millennials without financial advisors who said their investments perform extremely well (13%). \nJulie Bang | Investopedia. \nNearly two-thirds (65%) of the affluent millennials surveyed said they trust financial advisors, compared to only 58% of Gen Xers. They also trust books (58%), TV shows (54%), newspapers (53%), podcasts/radio (49%), magazines (48%), websites/blogs (37%), and YouTube (or similar video platform) videos (27%) for financial advice—just not as much as advisors. \nOur affluent millennials surveyed explained why they trust financial advisors the most: “I feel the personal connection gives them more stake in my success,” said one; “Because they have received the most training, schooling, etc. in the field and are the most knowledgeable” according to another. Other affluent millennials cited the ability to have a two-way conversation and develop personalized strategies, and the belief that financial advisors are accountable since their careers depend on knowledge and expertise. \nJulie Bang | Investopedia. \nDespite this willingness to work with advisors, however, some also demonstrate a healthy dose of skepticism. One affluent millennial said that while financial advisors were her go-to source because of their specialized training, they still needed to earn her trust and she asks lots of questions to test their knowledge. \nEarly Financial Education Incites Greater Confidence in Adulthood \nThe way affluent millennials feel about managing their finances often reflects how effectively their parents managed money. Only 9% of those who said their parents were good at managing finances said they feel “very anxious” about managing their own money as adults, compared to 24% of those who said their parents were not good at managing finances. \nConversely, among respondents who said their parents successfully managed their money, 46% have high confidence in managing their finances, compared to only 30% of those who said their parents were ineffective at managing finances. \nJulie Bang | Investopedia. \nWhat motivated one affluent millennials’s first investment was \"a life lesson from my pops.\" Another respondent explained: \"I was told that I have to start thinking beyond myself and think about my future family.” The takeaway? Modeling responsible financial behavior and talking about money with your kids may make them better investors. Data backs up common sense. \nWhy Affluent Millennials? \nInvestopedia sought to examine what motivated investment decisions for a generation that came into adulthood during the great recession and has notoriously encountered a variety of challenging economic factors. In order to understand attitudes around investment, we studied those who should have disposable income to invest, referred to as “affluent millennials.” By examining a segment of the population that makes a greater than average yearly income for their age group, we hoped to eliminate financial hardship from the reasons they may not invest. \nThe Bottom Line \nThe Investopedia Affluent Millennials Survey reveals the importance of financial education, as evidenced by those who learned about investing as a teenager feeling confident enough to invest as an adult. Further, observing how their parents managed finances has shaped many affluent millennials’ confidence as adults as well. Earning a good income alone doesn’t always go hand-in-hand with knowing how to invest or feeling comfortable managing money. \nBased on these findings, here are four ways affluent millennials can plan more effectively for their financial future: \nAffluent millennials should contribute to a retirement account, even if they’re not concerned about their finances: 12% of respondents said they don’t yet, despite their income.\nFor those that do invest already, they should save even more for retirement: 46% of respondents said they didn’t feel they were saving enough, even though nearly 8 in 10 affluent millennials said that saving for retirement is a top priority. Time value of money and compounding demonstrate how investing more earlier can add hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime.\nInvesting less conservatively is also key — affluent millennials can afford to take more calculated risks with the goal of earning higher returns, as they have both the advantages of time and more money to work with.\nFinally, working with a financial professional can alleviate economic anxieties. Affluent millennials report substantially better investment performance when they work with an advisor, and having expert advice can help avoid missteps and missed opportunities.\nAccording to Scott A. Bishop, CFP®, executive vice president of financial planning at STA Wealth Management in Houston, “Not investing is what is risky. If you don’t save or invest, the true risk is that you will never have any level of financial independence.\"",

  "text": "Finding Short Candidates With Technical Analysis\nWhen shorting equities, one often faces the challenge of distinguishing between a topping formation and a change in trend. Many successful short sellers will try to focus their efforts by looking at clues that are offered from the schools of technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Read on to find out how studying these different methods a trader can gain confidence in shorting the market. \nTechnical Analysis \nSince the equities markets are primarily dominated by long traders, short traders try to prey on the weak longs to trigger breaks and start downtrends. They try to put enough pressure on the market to create situations where the weaker long get out because of the fear of giving back gains. It is the job of the short seller to find tools, such as different chart patterns or indicators that are used specifically for predicting the start of a decline or a panic sell. \nTrying to short a market using technical analysis usually means finding an overbought indicator and a trend indicator that is reliable enough to show the equity is a candidate for a down move. The overbought indicator is most likely either a relative strength index (RSI) or a stochastic oscillator. A trend indicator can be as simple as a short-term moving average (MA). \nWhen using an oscillator, the trader is relying on it to show that the market has reached a level that indicates it may be running out of buyers. A trend indicator, on the other hand, is usually used to show that support has been broken because the market has become weak. When shorting an equity, it is very important that the trader knows that with an oscillator they are selling strength, but with a trend indicator, they are looking to short weakness. \nFundamental Analysis \nFundamentally, there are several ways to pinpoint short candidates, including bad earnings, lawsuits, changes in legislation, and news. The key to using the fundamentals or news to trade equity on the short side is making an informed decision about whether the event taking place is a short-term issue or a long-term event. \nA negative news event is most likely to cause a spike down in a market and not necessarily set up good long-term decline. In this case, the spike has most likely been caused by stop-loss orders being triggered. A long-term decline can start with a spike down but is most likely triggered by a series of negative events that give traders confidence that a longer-term downtrend is developing. \nAn example of a spike down triggered by a news event is when a company's earnings are reported lower than the consensus. Traders react by selling the stock. A series of negative earnings reports, however, is the type of fundamental that often attracts the short seller. \nWhen an event is significant enough to crack the support of a market, volatility will often increase as nervous long traders begin to feel the pressure of the short sellers trying to drive the market lower. This is when a trader can use both types of analysis to determine the severity of the decline that is in store. \nIn general, a negative news announcement is often accompanied by heavy volume and wide ranges as short-selling pressure builds in an attempt to drive the stock to technical levels which will trigger more sell stops. The short seller, driven by the confidence of the negative fundamentals, continues to try to push the market through support points, which makes it painful to hold on to long positions. \nShort Selling in Action \nHeavy volume, wide ranges, and lower closes often catch the eye of short traders. Upon further investigation, the short trader will then decide that the news event or fundamental is strong enough to trigger a liquidation of long positions. These conditions may encourage short sellers to initiate new short positions. \nA good example of this kind of setup took place in the S&P Financial SPDR Fund (AMEX:XLF) back in early 2007. Figure 1 illustrates how short sellers identified a potential opportunity and used negative evidence from technical and fundamental analysis to take control of a falling market. \nFigure 1 (Source: TradeStation) \nShort sellers watched volume increase and eventually triggered a downside acceleration. \nAfter a prolonged move up and a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, the RSI and stochastic indicators reached overbought levels. This was enough information to cause traders to think a top was being formed, but not enough to attract any selling pressure because, throughout the up move, the same oscillators had indicated possible tops. \nThe XLF offered the first clue of a top on Feb. 20, 2007, at 37.99, and began its break to 34.18 by March 14, 2007. This move was the largest down move in terms of price and time that the market had seen since 2004. Compared to previous breaks, this move was much more severe, which was a major clue that the XLF was topping seen in Figure 2. \nFigure 2 (Source: TradeStation) \nThe severe break during February and March gave a clear indication that XLF was topping. \nWhile technical factors may have identified a possible top, news stories helped traders gain confidence in the short side by supplying the market with negativity. On Feb. 26, 2007, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan warned of a recession by the end of 2007. The next day, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 8.8%. European stocks also experienced large one-day declines, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped sharply.1 \nDuring the course of these broad market breaks, XLF also attracted short-selling pressure as bearish traders interpreted this as a sign a recession could possibly cut into future earnings of financial institutions. \nThe first move down was triggered by a combination of technical and fundamental factors. It offered clues to traders that the XLF was sensitive to the news which had a potential effect on futures earnings. It also identified price points in the market which may have been defended by long traders. During February and March, it was reported that several subprime businesses filed for bankruptcy.2 This news, along with Mr. Greenspan's comments, most likely contributed to the decline in XLF from Feb. 20 to March 14. \nAs the market was forming its top in early spring, more fundamentally bearish data was released, which painted a grim picture when combined with the weakening technical setup. In early April, New Century Financial Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.3 While this news may not have immediately triggered a break in the market, when combined with the subprime bankruptcy filings in February and March, a bearish fundamental trend started to form. \nXLF showed a downward price trend throughout the spring and summer. During this time period, short sellers likely gained confidence from the unfavorable fundamentals, news stories, and the visibly bearish chart patterns. Short sellers were likely encouraged by the negatively-toned news stories which spread pessimism among investors. Meanwhile, the technical patterns on the charts kept reaffirming the downtrend with a series of lower tops and lower bottoms seen in Figure 3. \nBased on the combination of the technicals and fundamentals, it was clear that the short sellers were in control of XLF. \nFigure 3 (Source: TradeStation) \nThe series of lower tops and lower bottoms indicate a clear downtrend throughout the spring and summer months. \nThe Bottom Line \nIn summary, to be a successful short seller, one must be aware of the clues that are offered both technically and fundamentally. Technically, the short trader must be able to distinguish between a topping formation and a change in trend. They must learn the types of formations that indicate a short-term top or a long-term trend. \nFundamentally, the short-trader has to distinguish between a one-time news event and the start of a series of negative events. By learning how both the technicals and fundamentals work together, a trader will gain confidence that can help one comfortably to go short in the market. \nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

  "text": "Income Stock: What it is, How it Works, Example\nWhat Is an Income Stock? \nAn income stock is a security that pays regular, often steadily increasing, dividends. \nKey Takeaways\nIncome stocks are stocks that offer regular and steady income, usually in the form of dividends, over a period of time with low exposure to risk.\nIncome stocks usually offer a high yield that may generate the majority of the security's overall returns. \nThe ideal income stock would have very low volatility, a dividend yield higher than the prevailing 10-year Treasury note rate, and a modest level of annual profit growth.\nIncome stocks are different from growth stocks, which have higher volatility and risks associated with their performance.\nUnderstanding an Income Stock \nIncome stocks usually offer a high yield that may generate the majority of the security's overall returns. While there is no specific breakpoint for classification, most income stocks have lower levels of volatility than the overall stock market, and offer sustainable, higher-than-average dividend yields. \nIncome stocks may have limited future growth options, thereby requiring a lower level of ongoing capital investment. Any excess cash flow from profits can be directed back to investors on a regular basis. Income stocks can come from any industry, but investors commonly find them within real estate (through real estate investment trusts, or REITs), energy sectors, utilities, natural resources, and financial institutions. \nMany conservative investors seek income stocks because they want some exposure to corporate profit growth. At the same time, these stocks have steady streams of revenue that allow for a low risk and consistent source of revenue, perhaps for investors who are older and do not have regular salaries anymore. \nThe ideal income stock would have very low volatility (as measured by its beta), a dividend yield higher than the prevailing 10-year Treasury note (T-note) rate, and a modest level of annual profit growth. Ideal income stocks would also show a history of increasing dividends on a regular basis so as to keep up with inflation, which eats away at future cash payments. \nExample of an Income Stock \nRetail behemoth Walmart Inc. is an example of an income stock. As its stock price has risen over the last thirty years, the Arkansas-based company has consistently increased its dividend payout.1 \nThe company's dividend yield peaked at 3.32% in 2015 and, as of July 16, 2021, is at 1.55%, which is superior to the yield on the 10-year T-note.21 It has achieved this yield despite the threat of e-commerce and increased competition from Amazon, which has taken away its market share. \nIncome Stocks vs. Growth Stocks \nWhile many conservative investors target income stocks, those able and/or with the desire to take more risks are perhaps better off pursuing growth stocks. In contrast with income stocks, growth stocks usually do not pay dividends. Instead, company management often prefers to reinvest retained earnings into capital projects to boost future revenues and profit. \nFor example, a recently public technology firm might choose to hire a new team of engineers or put all their efforts for one or two quarters into a new product rollout, which not only requires technical expertise but also marketing and sales power, along with significant customer experience to reply to questions and concerns and help with troubleshooting. \nWhile growth stocks can bring significant capital gains, they generally also carry more risk than income stocks. With growth stocks, shareholders must rely on the company's investments paying off to generate a return on their investment (ROI). If the company's growth is not as high as expected, shareholders may end up losing their money as market confidence wanes and share prices drop. \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Alternative Investments\nIntroduction to Alternative Investments\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAlternative investment is a catch-all term that encompasses all investments except stocks; bonds; or cash (or a mutual fund or ETF that holds one of those three). Examples include derivatives, hedge funds, commodities, and private equity, but there are many more.\nIt depends on how you invest in the real estate. If you hold shares in a publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs), then it is not, as REITs are like stocks from an investment perspective. However if you hold real estate directly by yourself or through another type of real estate partnership then it is an alternative investment.\nYes, cryptocurrency is an alternative investment.\nAlternative investments tend to be risky for a few main reasons: they are complex, there is often little publicly available information about them so you have less ability to make informed decisions, and they can be more volatile.\nKey Terms\nSynthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)\nA synthetic CDO is an investment product that, rather than combining income from normal debt products such as bonds into securities, combines income from derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) into securities. They are usually divided up into tranches, which are portions of the pool of investments divided by risk.\nBespoke Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)\nA bespoke CDO is a one that is created for a single investor or group of investors who will buy all, or a single tranche of it. When a single tranche is sold, the remaining tranches are often held by the dealer.\nDark Pool\nA dark pool is a securities exchange mainly used to help facilitate large trades by institutional investors called block trades. This is done in order to avoid having these trades affect the price of the stock they are trading, which would increase trading costs.\nSwap Execution Facility (SEF)\nA SEF is a trading platform that allows people to buy and sell swaps. It operates similarly to how stocks are bought and sold on an exchange.\nMaster Limited Partnership (MLP)\nAn MLP is a business legally structured as a limited partnership that is publicly traded. They have tax benefits compared to a C corporation structure, but only companies in certain industries, usually natural resources of some kind or real estate, can use this structure.\nNonfinancial Asset\nA nonfinancial asset is something the value of which comes from its physical traits, rather than a contractual claim such as the contract of a bond issuer to pay back a bondholder the value of the bond plus interest. Examples of nonfinancial assets include real estate, art, and vehicles.\nCollectible\nA collectible is an object that is worth a significantly greater amount of money than a normal object of its type due to its rarity or popularity. Examples include coins, comic books, stamps or antiques.\nExchange Traded Derivative\nAn exchange traded derivative is any type of derivative that is traded on a financial exchange. This contrasts with derivatives traded over-the-counter (OTC).\nExplore Alternative Investments\n5 Alternative Investments \nWhat Does Metaverse Mean and How Does This Virtual World Work?\nDisruptive Technology: Definition, Example, and How to Invest\nWarrants: A Risky but High-Return Investment Tool\nMaster Limited Partnership (MLP) Definition\nHow to Invest in Commodities\nHow to Automate Your Investing\nHow to Invest in Web 3.0\nBy\nGloria Chinemerem Chimelu\nUpdated Jun 29, 2023 \nBest Ways to Earn Passive Income\nHow to Invest in Gold and Silver\nHow to Buy Alternative Investments\nProfit Margins for the Food and Beverage Sector\nAsset-Backed (ABS) vs. Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS): What’s the Difference?\nWhat Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\nBespoke CDO: Definition, Uses, Vs.

  "text": "Sustainable Investing\nSustainable Investing\nFrequently Asked Questions\nSustainable investing is an investing philosophy wherein an investor takes a company’s environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors into account. This allows investment dollars to be used as a tool to promote positive societal impact and corporate responsibility without sacrificing long-term financial returns. Strategies for investing sustainably include avoiding companies that conflict with ESG principles and seeking out industries that are inherently more sustainable.1\nFollowing the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) framework, there are a wide variety of investments that can be considered “sustainable.” Industries that promote good environmental practices, via more renewable energy sources or by combating air and water pollution, are perhaps the first things that come to mind for most people. However, sustainable investing can also include investing in companies that support human rights initiatives or a more ethical corporate culture.2\nFor someone to invest ethically, they must use their ethical principles as the primary filter when selecting companies to invest in. What makes this different from green or ESG investing, each of which typically have an overarching set of guidelines, is that the criteria that make a company “ethical” can differ from one investor to another. For example, two investors who both value clean energy companies may disagree on whether or not nuclear energy qualifies as a “clean” source.3\nA 2019 study of 11,000 mutual funds conducted by the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing found that there was no financial trade-off in the returns of sustainable funds compared to their more traditional counterparts. Additionally, regardless of the asset class held, sustainable funds also showed a significantly lower downside risk. Finally, during periods of high market volatility, sustainable funds generally proved to be more stable investments.4\nKey Terms\nEthical Investing\nEthical investing is a form of investing wherein an investor purchases shares in companies because they share their personal values. Alternatively, investors may choose to instead remove specific industries from their portfolios that contradict or actively harm the causes they care about. It’s important for investors to do their research, especially when it comes to indices or mutual funds, to ensure their investments accurately align with their ethics.\nSustainability\nSustainability refers to something’s ability to be maintained at a certain rate or level. In terms of the business world, companies are considered “sustainable” if they create wealth and make people’s lives better without compromising the health and wealth of future generations. The goals of sustainability for businesses generally involve reducing natural resource extraction and waste generation as much as possible.\nISO 14001\nIssued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ISO 14001 is a set of standards clarifying the best ways for organizations to reduce their environmental footprint by adopting an effective environmental management system (EMS). As with all ISO standards, rather than a specific set of instructions, ISO 14001 must be tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the organization adopting it. There are over 300,000 certifications to ISO 14001 in 171 countries.\nUN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)\nThe UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is a UN-backed international network of investors working to achieve a sustainable global financial system by encouraging the adoption of six aspirational principles. The PRI’s mission is to promote the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues into investment practices. The PRI is funded primarily via an annual membership fee, in addition to grants from governments, foundations, and other international organizations.\nGreen Investing\nGreen investing is a form of investing designed to promote positive environmental change. Companies that focus on combating pollution, conserving natural resources, and other environmentally-conscious business practices are prime candidates for green investing. There are several different avenues for investors considering green investing, including green equities, green bonds, and green funds.\nGreen Marketing\nGreen marketing is a form of advertising designed to highlight a product or company’s environmentally sustainable qualities. As pressure mounts for companies to demonstrate their commitment to protecting the environment, green marketing has become one component of a much larger sustainable business movement. When a company fails to live up to the promises of its own green marketing, it may be criticized for using positive environmental messaging to make false or misleading advertising.\nGreen Fund\nA green fund is a mutual fund or other type of investment vehicle that exclusively invests in socially conscious or environmentally friendly companies. Green funds have become popular among investors seeking both socially responsible investments and to capitalize on the uptick in green technologies. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, registered investment companies with ESG criteria, such as mutual funds and index funds, managed $3.1 trillion in assets in 2020.\nCarbon Trade\nCarbon trading, also known as carbon emissions trading, refers to the buying and selling of carbon credits that allow an entity to emit a limited quantity of greenhouse gasses. Since a profit can be made by selling leftover credits, both companies and governments are incentivized to scale down their carbon emissions in order to have more permits to sell. The idea of carbon trading was based on the 1990 Clean Air Act that significantly cut sulfur pollution.\nExplore Sustainable Investing\nInvesting for Sustainability Impact (IFSI): Meaning and How It Works\nWhat is Sustainability?

  "text": "Efficient Market Hypothesis: Is the Stock Market Efficient?\nAn important debate among investors is whether the stock market is efficient—that is, whether it reflects all the information made available to market participants at any given time. The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) maintains that all stocks are perfectly priced according to their inherent investment properties, the knowledge of which all market participants possess equally. \nFinancial theories are subjective. In other words, there are no proven laws in finance. Instead, ideas try to explain how the market works. Here, we take a look at where the efficient market hypothesis has fallen short in terms of explaining the stock market's behavior. While it may be easy to see a number of deficiencies in the theory, it's important to explore its relevance in the modern investing environment. \nKey Takeaways\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis assumes all stocks trade at their fair value.\nThe weak tenet implies stock prices reflect all available information, the semi-strong implies stock prices are factored into all publicly available information, and the strong tenet implies all information is already factored into the stock prices.\nThe theory assumes it would be impossible to outperform the market and that all investors interpret available information the same way.\nAlthough most decisions are still made by humans, the use of computers to analyze information may be making the theory more relevant.\nEfficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) Tenets and Variations \nThere are three tenets to the efficient market hypothesis: the weak, the semi-strong, and the strong. \nThe weak make the assumption that current stock prices reflect all available information. It goes further to say past performance is irrelevant to what the future holds for the stock. Therefore, it assumes that technical analysis can't be used to achieve returns. \nThe semi-strong form of the theory contends stock prices are factored into all information that is publicly available. Therefore, investors can't use fundamental analysis to beat the market and make significant gains. \nIn the strong form of the theory, all information—both public and private—are already factored into the stock prices. So it assumes no one has an advantage to the information available, whether that's someone on the inside or out. Therefore, it implies the market is perfect, and making excessive profits from the market is next to impossible. \nThe EMH was developed from economist Eugene Fama's Ph.D. dissertation in the 1960s.\nProblems of EMH \nWhile it may sound great, this theory is not without criticism. Other schools of thought, such as Alphanomics, argue that markets can be inefficient. \nFirst, the efficient market hypothesis assumes all investors perceive all available information in precisely the same manner. The different methods for analyzing and valuing stocks pose some problems for the validity of the EMH. If one investor looks for undervalued market opportunities while another evaluates a stock on the basis of its growth potential, these two investors will already have arrived at a different assessment of the stock's fair market value. Therefore, one argument against the EMH points out that since investors value stocks differently, it is impossible to determine what a stock should be worth in an efficient market. \nProponents of the EMH conclude investors may profit from investing in a low-cost, passive portfolio.\nSecondly, no single investor is ever able to attain greater profitability than another with the same amount of invested funds under the efficient market hypothesis. Since they both have the same information, they can only achieve identical returns. But consider the wide range of investment returns attained by the entire universe of investors, investment funds, and so forth. If no investor had any clear advantage over another, would there be a range of yearly returns in the mutual fund industry, from significant losses to 50% profits or more? According to the EMH, if one investor is profitable, it means every investor is profitable. But this is far from true. \nThirdly (and closely related to the second point), under the efficient market hypothesis, no investor should ever be able to beat the market or the average annual returns that all investors and funds are able to achieve using their best efforts. This would naturally imply, as many market experts often maintain, the absolute best investment strategy is simply to place all of one's investment funds into an index fund. This would increase or decrease according to the overall level of corporate profitability or losses. But there are many investors who have consistently beaten the market. Warren Buffett is one of those who's managed to outpace the averages year after year. \nQualifying the EMH \nEugene Fama never imagined that his efficient market would be 100% efficient all the time. That would be impossible, as it takes time for stock prices to respond to new information. The efficient hypothesis, however, doesn't give a strict definition of how much time prices need to revert to fair value. Moreover, under an efficient market, random events are entirely acceptable, but will always be ironed out as prices revert to the norm. \nBut it's important to ask whether EMH undermines itself by allowing random occurrences or environmental eventualities. There is no doubt that such eventualities must be considered under market efficiency but, by definition, true efficiency accounts for those factors immediately. In other words, prices should respond nearly instantaneously with the release of new information that can be expected to affect a stock's investment characteristics. So, if the EMH allows for inefficiencies, it may have to admit that absolute market efficiency is impossible. \nIncreasing Market Efficiency? \nAlthough it's relatively easy to pour cold water on the efficient market hypothesis, its relevance may actually be growing. With the rise of computerized systems to analyze stock investments, trades, and corporations, investments are becoming increasingly automated on the basis of strict mathematical or fundamental analytical methods. Given the right power and speed, some computers can immediately process any and all available information, and even translate such analysis into an immediate trade execution. \nDespite the increasing use of computers, most decision-making is still done by human beings and is therefore subject to human error. Even at an institutional level, the use of analytical machines is anything but universal. While the success of stock market investing is based mostly on the skill of individual or institutional investors, people will continually search for the surefire method of achieving greater returns than the market averages. \nThe Bottom Line \nIt's safe to say the market is not going to achieve perfect efficiency anytime soon. For greater efficiency to occur, all of these things must happen: \nUniversal access to high-speed and advanced systems of pricing analysis.\nA universally accepted analysis system of pricing stocks.\nAn absolute absence of human emotion in investment decision-making.\nThe willingness of all investors to accept that their returns or losses will be exactly identical to all other market participants.\nIt is hard to imagine even one of these criteria of market efficiency ever being met. \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE): Definition, History, How It Works\nWhat Is the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)? \nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is the largest stock exchange in Japan, headquartered in its capital city of Tokyo. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was established on May 15, 1878. As of Sept. 14, 2021, the exchange had 3,784 listed companies.1 The TSE is run by the Japan Exchange Group and is home to the largest and best-known Japanese giants with a global presence—including Toyota, Honda, and Mitsubishi. \nIn addition, the TSE offers specific trading information, real-time and historical index quotes, market statistics, and information about and from specialists. Notably, the acronym TSE for the Tokyo Stock Exchange should not be confused with Canada's Toronto Stock Exchange, which is known by the acronym TSX. \nKey Takeaways\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is the largest stock exchange in Japan, listing 3,784 companies (as of Sept. 2021).1\nFrom 1991 to 2001, the TSE shrank dramatically as the Japanese economy contracted after the country's equity and real estate bubbles burst.\nThe TSE lists the largest companies in Japan, including Toyota, Softbank, Keyence Corporation, Sony Corporation, and Chugai Pharmaceutical.\nThe TSE is comprised of five sections; the first two sections are called the \"Main Market\" and include large cap and medium cap companies.\nTwo sections are reserved for startup companies and the last section of the TSE is for professional investors only.\nUnderstanding the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) \nAt the peak of the Japanese asset price bubble in Dec. 1989, the Nikkei 225 index reached a record high of 38,916.2 Following this, the TSE's combined market capitalization shrank dramatically over the next two decades, as the Japanese economy struggled with a recessionary environment and the Nikkei plunged in value. \nAs of Sept. 2021, the board members of the Tokyo Stock Exchange are Director\n(Chairperson of the Board) Tsuda Hiroki; Director & Representative Executive Officer, Group CEO Kiyota Akira; Director & Representative Executive Officer, Group COO Yamaji Hiromi; and Directors Iwanaga Moriyuki and Shizuka Masaki.3 \nThe five largest stocks by market capitalization listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as of the end of July 2021 were (in 100 millions of Japanese yen): \nToyota Motor Corporation (¥319,936).\nKeyence Corporation (¥147,724).\nSony Group Corporation (¥143,445).\nSoftBank Group Corp. (¥117,798).\nRecruit Holdings Co. (¥95,465).4\nWhen the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) first opened in 1878, some of its first customers were former samurai, who needed a market to trade bonds that had been issued to them by the government.\nOther Major International Exchanges \nIn addition to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, other major trading exchanges worldwide include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq, and the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Each exchange has specific listing requirements that owners must meet prior to offering their securities for trading. \nIn general, these requirements include regular financial reports, such as audited earning reports, and minimum capital requirements. For example, the NYSE has a key listing requirement that stipulates a company must have at least 1.1 million publicly traded shares of stock with a stock price of at least $4 per share. The company must have an aggregate pre-tax income of $10 million for the previous three fiscal years, with at least $2 million in each of the most recent two fiscal years.5 Nasdaq requires listers to meet aggregate pre-tax income in the prior three fiscal years of at least $11 million and a minimum bid price of $4.6 \nCriticism of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) \nSome market participants have complained that over the years the TSE has become too large and complicated compared to other global exchanges. The TSE consists of five sections. The first section lists Japan's biggest companies and the second section lists medium-sized companies. Combined, these two sections are called the \"main markets.\"7 \nThen there are two sections dedicated to startups. These sections are called the \"Mothers\" (Market of the High-Growth and Emerging Stocks) and the Jasdaq (which is separated further into standard and growth sub-sections). The final section is the Tokyo Pro Market, which is for professional investors only.7 \nTo complicate matters, each of these TSE sections has its own listing requirements. As of Sept. 14, 2021, the first section alone included about 2,190 companies, almost double the level from 1990.18 A plan to reform the TSE includes simplifying the criteria separating the sections and reducing the number of sections to three—Prime, Standard, and Growth. Another possible change includes increasing the market cap requirement to reduce the number of companies listed in the top tier. \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Guide to Mutual Funds\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMutual fund orders are executed once a day, at 4 p.m. Eastern Time, and are typically posted by 6 p.m.\nSome funds have no minimum investment at all, though most set between $500 and $5,000 as the entry-level amount.\nThat depends on the fund type: stock funds are taxed at the capital gains rate, bond funds are taxed differently (some are tax-exempt), and international funds may depend on the issuing country’s tax rate and whether the U.S. has a tax treaty with that country.\nFunds generally set the price of transacting units according to the fund’s net asset value (NAV), the total value of its assets minus all of its liabilities.\nYes, they can. Investors need to avoid funds with overlapping holdings, make sure their funds meet their investment goals, and watch the fees.\nThat depends on the type of fund and whether it is actively or passively managed. Quant funds usually charge less than those doing fundamental analysis; small-cap and international funds usually cost more. Within categories, compare similar funds and look at Morningstar’s average figures for fund types.\nKey Terms\nGrowth and Income Fund\nA growth and income fund is a mutual fund or ETF strategy that combines using the capital gains potential of the growth segment and the dividend income and stability of the value segment.\nFeeder Fund\nA feeder fund is one of many smaller investment funds that pool investor money, which is then aggregated under a single centralized master fund, allowing for reduced operation and trading costs.\nAbnormal Return\nAn abnormal return deviates from an investment’s expected return and can help investors determine risk-adjusted performance or measure the effect of events such as lawsuits or buyouts.\nSpider (SPDR)\nThe cornerstone of many investor portfolios, \"Spider\" refers to Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts, or SPDR, which is an exchange-traded fund that tracks its underlying index, the S&P 500.\nAggressive Growth Fund\nAggressive growth funds invest in companies that have high growth potential, including newer companies and those in hot sectors of the economy.They are actively managed to achieve above-average returns when markets are rising, but are more volatile and may underperform in down markets.\nClass C Share\nClass-C mutual fund shares charge a level sales load set as a fixed percentage assessed each year. This is different from front-load shares that charge investors at purchase or back-end loads that charge at time of sale. Class-C shares work best for investors planning to hold them for three years or less.\nLife-Cycle Fund\nLife-cycle funds are asset-allocation funds in which the share of each asset class is automatically adjusted to lower risk as the desired retirement date approaches.

  "text": "Issued Share Capital vs. Subscribed Share Capital: What's the Difference?\nIssued Share Capital vs. Subscribed Share Capital: An Overview \nShare capital refers to the amount of funding a company raises through the sale of stock to public investors. This means the company grants shareholders a small ownership stake in the company in exchange for monetary investment. Share capital constitutes the main source of equity financing and can be generated through the sale of common or preferred shares. \nCommon stock is what most people think of when they talk about the stock market. Common, or ordinary, shareholders have voting rights and participate in major company decisions.1 Although companies at times pay dividends on common shares, they are not required to pay them. \nKey Takeaways\nShare capital is the total of all funds raised by a company through the sale of equity to investors.\nIssued share capital is the value of shares actually held by investors.\nSubscribed share capital is the value of shares investors have promised to buy when they are released.\nSubscribed shared capital is usually part of an IPO.\nPreferred shares, also called preference shares, do not entail the same kinds of ownership rights as common shares. However, they generally include a guaranteed dividend each year that must be paid before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders. In short, though preferred shareholders have fewer rights, they do have a higher claim on company assets.2 \nAlthough share capital refers to a dollar amount, it is dictated by the number and selling price of a company's shares. For example, if a company issues 1,000 shares for $25 per share, it generates $25,000 in share capital. \nShare capital is only generated by the initial sale of shares by the company to investors. If the investor goes on to trade those shares to a third party, any profit made on the sale does not contribute to the issuing company's share capital. \nIssued Share Capital \nIssued shares are the shares sold to and held by company investors. These investors can include large institutions or individual retail investors. Sometimes, large institutional purchases of shares may only be partially paid for and will be accounted as called-up share capital. The amount already received in payment is the paid-up share capital. When fully paid, the amount is recorded as paid-in share capital. \nIssued share capital is simply the monetary value of the shares of stock a company actually offers for sale to investors. The number of issued shares generally corresponds to the amount of subscribed share capital, though neither amount can exceed the authorized amount. \nWhen a company prepares to \"go public\" by issuing stock for the first time, investors can submit an application expressing their desire to participate.3\nSubscribed Share Capital \nSubscribed shares are shares that investors have promised to buy. These shares are usually subscribed as part of an initial public offering (IPO). \nUnderwriters often promise to deliver a certain number of subscribed shares prior to the IPO. The subscribers are usually large institutional investors and banks. Subscribed share capital refers to the monetary value of all the shares for which investors have expressed an interest. \nSpecial Considerations \nShare capital can fall into one of several other categories, depending on where the company is in the equity-raising process. They include the following: \nAuthorized Share Capital \nThe maximum amount of share capital a company is allowed to raise is called its authorized capital. Though this does not limit the number of shares a company may issue, it does put a ceiling on the total amount of money that can be raised by the sale of those shares. \nCalled-Up vs. Paid-Up Share Capital \nDepending on the business and applicable regulations, companies may issue stock to investors with the understanding the investors will pay at a later date. Any funds due for shares issued but not fully paid for are called-up share capital. Any funds remitted for shares are considered as paid-up capital. \nOther types of capital, such as debt financing or mezzanine financing, are not considered share capital. Debt capital includes financing sources such as lines of credit, business loans, and credit card balances. While mezzanine financing, like share capital, is included under the equity section of the balance sheet, it is not considered share capital. \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Preference Shares: Advantages and Disadvantages\nPreference shares, which are issued by companies seeking to raise capital, combine the characteristics of debt and equity investments, and are consequently considered to be hybrid securities. Preference shareholders experience both advantages and disadvantages. On the upside, they collect dividend payments before common stock shareholders receive such income. But on the downside, they do not enjoy the voting rights that common shareholders typically do.1 \nKey Takeaways\nPreference shareholders receive dividend payments before common shareholders.\nPreference shareholders do not enjoy voting rights like their common shareholder counterparts do.\nCompanies incur higher issuing costs with preferred shares than they do when issuing debt.12\nAdvantages of Preference Shares \nOwners of preference shares receive fixed dividends, well before common shareholders see any money.1 In either case, dividends are only paid if the company turns a profit. But there is a wrinkle to this situation because a type of preference shares known as cumulative shares allow for the accumulation of unpaid dividends that must be paid out at a later date. So, once a struggling business finally rebounds and is back in the black, those unpaid dividends are remitted to preferred shareholders before any dividends can be paid to common shareholders. \nHigher Claim on Company Assets \nIn the event that a company experiences a bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation, preferred shareholders have a higher claim on company assets than common shareholders do.1 Not surprisingly, preference shares attract conservative investors, who enjoy the comfort of the downside risk protection baked into these investments. \nAdditional Investor Benefits \nA subcategory of preference shares known as convertible shares lets investors trade in these types of preference shares for a fixed number of common shares, which can be lucrative if the value of common shares begins climbing.3 Such participating shares let investors reap additional dividends that are above the fixed rate if the company meets certain predetermined profit targets. \nDisadvantages of Preference Shares \nThe main disadvantage of owning preference shares is that the investors in these vehicles don't enjoy the same voting rights as common shareholders.1 This means that the company is not beholden to preferred shareholders the way it is to traditional equity shareholders. Although the guaranteed return on investment makes up for this shortcoming, if interest rates rise, the fixed dividend that once seemed so lucrative can dwindle. This could cause buyer's remorse with preference shareholder investors, who may realize that they would have fared better with higher interest fixed-income securities. \nFinancing through shareholder equity, either with common or preferred shares, lowers a company's debt-to-equity ratio, which is a sign of a well-managed business.\nCompany Benefits \nPreference shares benefit issuing companies in several ways. The aforementioned lack of voter rights for preference shareholders places the company in a strength position by letting it retain more control. Furthermore, companies can issue callable preference shares, which affords them the right to repurchase shares at their discretion.2 This means that if callable shares are issued with a 6% dividend but interest rates fall to 4%, then a company can purchase any outstanding shares at the market price, then reissue those shares with a lower dividend rate. This ultimately reduces the cost of capital. Of course, this same flexibility is a disadvantage to shareholders. \nTrade on the Go.

  "text": "Finding a Financial Advisor\nThe Investopedia 100 \nThe Right Financial Advisor for You\nFrequently Asked Questions\nA financial advisor is a professional who builds personalized financial plans to achieve the life goals of clients. Financial advisors help clients analyze and visualize their financial situations, including risk tolerance and risk capacity. Plus, they provide a buffet of services to improve clients’ financial futures, including investment advising, debt management, retirement planning, and tax assistance, among other services. Even after constructing an initial financial plan with a client, a financial advisor will regularly reassess the client’s situation to keep financial goals on track and ensure clients’ comfort and satisfaction with financial decisions.\nYou can find a financial advisor by asking for recommendations from family and friends, or you can search online. Many professional financial planning associations offer searchable databases of advisors such as the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the Financial Planning Association. No matter what title an advisor claims to have, it is recommended that you vet any potential advisor's credentials, experience, and fee structures before sharing your financial information. You can look up a firm's or individual's background by looking up the firm's Form ADV on the Investment Advisor Public Disclosure website.\nThe cost of a financial advisor can vary based on the kind of advisor you choose to work with and their payment structure. Financial advisors are usually paid through fees, commissions, or a blend of the two. Fee-based advisors earn a set hourly rate for their services or a set percentage of clients’ assets under management, while commission-based advisors earn commission through the products they sell. Within the field of financial advisory, there are three main types of advisors: human advisors, robo-advisors, and digital advisors. The cost—and what you get with each one—will vary. \nThe annual Investopedia 100 Awards celebrates financial advisors who are making significant contributions to critical conversations about financial literacy, investing strategies, life-stage planning and wealth management. With more than 100,000 independent financial advisors in the U.S., the Investopedia 100 spotlights the country’s most engaged, influential, and educational advisors.\nThe annual Investopedia 100 list honors independent U.S.-based financial advisors who have demonstrated top-of-the-industry commitment to financial literacy by using their social and traditional media reach, and who have received community support through peer nominations. To determine winners, Investopedia's data science and editorial teams measure each advisor's domain authority of their personal blog or website, followers across social media and podcasts, participation in workshops, programs, nonprofits or collaborations to spread financial education, and peer nominations by industry professionals outside of their own firms. Applications are checked for accuracy and quality, too.\nIn addition to working with a financial advisor, you may wish to continue your education on investing, growing wealth, or general financial planning. As part of the 2023 Investopedia 100, we asked seven of our top financial advisors to share the investing books that they have read and shared with their clients. The books touch on financial planning for couples, the behavioral psychology of money, and how to start legacy planning.\nKey Terms\nFinancial Advisor\nA financial advisor provides financial advice or guidance to clients for payment. Financial advisors can provide many different services including investment management, tax planning, retirement planning, and estate planning. A wide variety of licenses and certifications may be required depending on the services provided by a given financial advisor.\nCertified Financial Planner\nCertified Financial Planner (CFP) is a recognition of expertise in the areas of financial planning, taxes, insurance, estate planning, and retirement saving. The title is awarded by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards to people who have completed the CFP exam and take continuous coursework to sustain the certification.\nFiduciary\nA fiduciary is a person or organization that acts on behalf of another party, putting their clients’ interests ahead of their own. Fiduciaries are held to the fiduciary standard, meaning that they have a duty to preserve good faith and trust. Therefore, the role of a fiduciary requires being bound both legally and ethically to act in the client’s best interest. Not all financial advisors are fiduciaries, though many are.\nAsset Allocation\nAsset allocation is an investment strategy that aims to balance risk and reward by apportioning an individual’s portfolio assets according to their goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. The three main asset classes—equities, fixed-income, and cash and equivalents—have different levels of risk and return, so each will behave differently over time.\nRisk Tolerance\nRisk tolerance is a measure of the degree of loss an investor is willing to endure within their portfolio, so it is a valuable consideration in investment decisions. Stock volatility, market swings, economic or political events, and regulatory, or interest rate changes affect an investor's risk tolerance. Therefore, greater risk tolerance is often synonymous with investment in stocks, equity funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while lower risk tolerance is often associated with the purchase of bonds, bond funds, and income funds.\nInvestment Horizon\nInvestment horizon is the term used to describe the total length of time that an investor expects to hold a security or a portfolio for an individual or company, and it can span as short as a few days or as long as two decades. The length of an investment horizon will often determine how much risk an investor is exposed to and what their income needs are. Generally, when portfolios have a shorter investment horizon, that means investors are willing to take on less risk.\nRisk Capacity\nRisk capacity, unlike tolerance, is the amount of risk that the investor \"must\" take in order to reach their financial goals. The rate of return necessary to reach these goals can be estimated by examining time frames and income requirements. Then, the rate of return information can be used to help the investor decide upon the types of investments to engage in and the level of risk to take on.\nSuitability Standard\nSuitability refers to an ethical, enforceable standard regarding investments that all financial professionals are held to when dealing with clients. Before making a recommendation, brokers, money managers, and other financial advisors have a duty to ensure their advice is appropriate for their clients’ goals, needs, and risk tolerance. In the U.S., the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) oversees and enforces this standard, outlining suitability requirements in its Rule 2111.\nFee-Based Financial Advisor\nThe term ‘fee-based' describes a kind of financial advisor who receives some or all of their income from fees paid to the advisor by the client. Many fee-based advisors not only receive pay from clients but also earn commission from brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, or insurance companies when they sell products. Advisors who exclusively earn pay through fees are called ‘fee-only’ advisors.\nCommission-Based Financial Advisor\nCommission-based financial advisors receive compensation from clients based on product sales. They receive pay when their clients make a specific financial transaction that they recommend, such as purchasing a stock or other asset.\nInvesting",

  "text": "Benefits of Holding Stocks for the Long Term\nA long-term investment strategy entails holding investments for more than 12 months. This strategy includes holding assets like bonds, stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and more. It requires discipline and patience to take a long-term approach. That's because investors must be able to take on a certain amount of risk while they wait for higher rewards down the road. \nInvesting in stocks and holding them is one of the best ways to grow wealth over the long term. For example, the S&P 500 experienced annual losses in only 13 years between 1974 and 2023, demonstrating that the stock market generates returns much more often than it doesn't.1 \nKey Takeaways\nLong-term stock investments tend to outperform short-term trades when timing the market.\nEmotional trading tends to hamper investor returns.\nThe S&P 500 posted positive returns for investors over most 20-year periods.\nRiding out temporary market downswings is often considered a sign of a good investor.\nLong-term investing cuts costs and allows you to compound earnings from dividends.\nBetter Long-Term Returns \nThe term asset class refers to a specific category of investments. They share the same characteristics and qualities, such as fixed-income assets (bonds) or equities, which are commonly called stocks. The asset class that's best for you depends on several factors, including your age, risk profile and tolerance, investment goals, and the amount of capital you have. But which asset classes are best for long-term investors? \nIf we look at several decades of asset class returns, we find that stocks have generally outperformed almost all other asset classes. The S&P 500 returned a geometric average of 9.80% per year between 1928 and 2023. This compares favorably to the 3.30% return for three-month Treasury bills (T-bills), the 4.86% return of 10-year Treasury notes, and the 6.55% return for gold, to name a few.2 \nEmerging markets have some of the highest return potentials in the equity markets, but also carry the highest degree of risk. This class historically earned high average annual returns but short-term fluctuations have impacted their performance. For instance, the 10-year annualized return of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index was 4.02% as of Sept. 30, 2024.3 \nSmall and large caps have also delivered above-average returns. For instance, the 10-year return for the Russell 2000 index, which measures the performance of 2,000 small companies, was 8.39% as of Oct. 28, 2024. The large-cap Russell 1000 index had an average return of 13.15% for the last 10 years as of the same date.4 \nRiskier equity classes have historically delivered higher returns than their more conservative counterparts.\nYou Ride Out Highs and Lows \nStocks are considered long-term investments. This is, in part, because it's not unusual for stocks to drop 10% to 20% or more in value over a shorter period of time. Investors have the opportunity to ride out some of these highs and lows over a period of many years or even decades to generate a better long-term return. \nLooking back at stock market returns since the 1920s, individuals have rarely lost money investing in the S&P 500 for a 20-year time period.5 Even considering setbacks, such as the Great Depression, Black Monday, the tech bubble, and the financial crisis, investors would have experienced gains had they made an investment in the S&P 500 and held it uninterrupted for 20 years. \nWhile past results are no guarantee of future returns, it does suggest that long-term investing in stocks generally yields positive results if given enough time. \nS&P Dow Jones Indices / Investopedia\nDecisions May Be Less Emotional, More Lucrative \nLet's face it, we're not as calm and rational as we claim to be. In fact, one of the inherent flaws in investor behavior is the tendency to be emotional. Many individuals claim to be long-term investors until the stock market begins falling, which is when they tend to withdraw their money to avoid additional losses. \nMany investors fail to remain invested in stocks when a rebound occurs. In fact, they tend to jump back in only when most of the gains have already been achieved. This type of buy high, sell low behavior tends to cripple investor returns. \nAccording to Dalbar's Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior study, the S&P 500 had an average annualized return of 9.65% during the 30-year period ending Dec. 31, 2022. During the same time frame, the average equity fund investor experienced an average annual return of about 6.81%.6 \nThere are a few reasons why this happens. Here are just a couple of them: \nInvestors have a fear of regret. People often fail to trust their judgment and follow the hype instead, especially when markets drop. People tend to fall into the trap that they'll regret holding onto stocks and lose a lot more money because the stocks drop in value so they end up selling their holdings to assuage that fear.\nA sense of pessimism when things change. Optimism prevails during market rallies but the opposite is true when things turn sour. The market may experience fluctuations because of short-term surprise shocks, such as those related to the economy. But it's important to remember that these upsets are often short-lived and things will very likely turn around.\nInvestors who pay too much attention to the stock market tend to handicap their chances of success by trying to time the market too frequently. A simple long-term buy-and-hold strategy would have yielded far better results. \nLower Capital Gains Tax Rate \nProfits that result from the sale of any capital assets end up in a capital gain. This includes any personal assets, such as furniture, or investments like stocks, bonds, and real estate. \nAn investor who sells a financial security after holding it for less than a year is taxed on any gains at a rate that's the same as ordinary income. These are referred to as short-term capital gains. Depending on the individual's adjusted gross income (AGI), this tax rate could be as high as 37%.7 \nAny securities that are sold after being held for more than a year result in long-term capital gains. The gains are taxed at a maximum rate of just 20%. Investors in lower tax brackets may even qualify for a 0% long-term capital gains tax rate.8 \nMore Cost-Effective \nOne of the main benefits of a long-term investment approach is money. Keeping your stocks in your portfolio longer is more cost-effective than regular buying and selling because the longer you hold your investments, the fewer fees you have to pay. But how much does this all cost? \nAs we discussed in the last section, you save on taxes. Any gains from stock sales must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). That ends up increasing your tax liability, which means more money out of your pocket. Remember, short-term capital gains can cost you more than if you hold your stocks for a longer period of time.8 \nThen there are trading or transaction fees. How much you pay depends on the type of account you have and the investment firm that handles your portfolio. For instance, you may be charged a commission or markup, where the former is deducted when you buy and sell through a broker while markups are charged when the sale is directed through their own inventory. These costs are charged to your account whenever you trade stocks. This means your portfolio balance will drop with every sale you make. \nIn 2024, many active investors make trades through online brokerages that provide fee-free transactions. In these cases, you may not incur costs to complete some or all of your trades. However, it's still important for investors to weigh out the value of the time they spend on trades in comparison with the difference in performance between an active and a longer-term, buy-and-hold type of strategy. \nFirms often charge ongoing fees, such as account maintenance charges, that can also put a dent in your account balance. So if you're a regular trader with a short-term goal, your fees will add up even more when you factor in transaction fees.\nBenefit From Compounding With Dividend Stocks \nDividends are corporate profits distributed by companies with a track record of success. These tend to be blue chips or defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are companies that do well regardless of how the economy performs or when the stock market drops. \nThese companies pay regular dividends—usually every quarter—to eligible shareholders, which means that you get to share in their success. While it may be tempting to cash them out, there's a very good reason why you should reinvest the dividends into the companies that pay them. \nIf you own any bonds or mutual funds, you'll know about how compound interest affects your investments. Compound interest is any interest calculated on the principal balance of your stock portfolio and any earlier interest you earned. This means that any interest (or dividends) that your stock portfolio accumulates compounds over time, thereby increasing the amount in your account in the long run. \nBest Types of Stocks to Hold for the Long-Term \nThere are several things to consider when you want to purchase stocks. Consider your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals, among other things. Having a handle on all of this can help you figure out the kind of equity portfolio you can create in order to meet your goals. Here's a general guide you can follow as a starting point that you can tailor to your own situation: \nChoose index funds. These are ETFs that track specific indexes, such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 1000, and trade just like stocks. But unlike stocks, these funds come with a lower cost and you won't have to pick and choose specific companies in which to invest. Index funds give you similar returns to the indexes they track.\nConsider dividend-paying stocks. These types of stocks can help add value to your portfolio, especially when dividends are reinvested.\nCompanies with high growth can boost your portfolio. Growth stocks tend to be associated with companies that are able to generate a significantly higher revenue and at a faster rate than others. They are also better equipped to deliver strong earnings reports. Keep in mind, though, that this degree of growth comes with a higher level of risk, so you'll have to be a little savvier than novice investors if you want to go this route.\nAs always, it's a good idea to consult with a financial professional, especially if you're new to the investment world.\nIf you're a millennial with your eyes on retirement, there are more resources here to help support your financial future.\nWhat Are the Tax Benefits of Holding a Stock Long Term?\nThe IRS taxes capital gains based on short-term and long-term holdings. Short-term capital gains are taxed on assets sold within a single year of ownership while long-term gains are taxed on the sale of assets held for more than 12 months.\nShort-term capital gains are treated as ordinary income, which means you could be taxed as high as 37% based on your tax bracket. Long-term gains, on the other hand, are only subject to a tax of 0%, 15%, or 20%. The rate depends on your adjusted gross income and filing status.89\nHow Long Do You Have to Hold a Stock for It to Be Considered Long Term?\nAs with any asset, you must hold a stock for a minimum of 12 months in order for it to be considered a long-term investment. Anything under that is deemed a short-term holding.8\nCan You Sell a Stock Right After Buying It?\nHow long you can wait until you sell the stock after buying it depends on the broker. Some firms require that you wait a certain amount of time (at least until the settlement date) to sell your stock. Others allow a certain number of same-day transactions within your account. People who make more than the allotted number of trades within the same day are considered day or pattern traders and are generally required to keep a minimum balance in their accounts.\nThe Bottom Line \nPeople who invest in stocks can benefit from many different trading strategies. Investors who have more experience and a higher amount of capital at their disposal may be able to ride the market waves and make money using short-term trading techniques. But that may not work for those who are just starting out or aren't able to tolerate too much risk. Holding stocks for the long-term can help you ride the highs and lows of the market and benefit from lower tax rates, and it tends to be less costly. \nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research.

  "text": "Investing in Index Funds: What You Need to Know\nWith a net worth of more than $96.5 billion, as of July 2022, Warren Buffett1 is one of the most successful investors of all time. His investing style, which is based on discipline, value, and patience, has yielded results that have consistently outperformed the market for decades. While regular investors—that is, the rest of us—don’t have the money to invest the way Buffett does, we can follow one of his ongoing recommendations: Low-cost index funds are the smartest investment most people can make. \nAs Buffett wrote in a 2016 letter to shareholders, “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.”2 \nIf you’re thinking about taking his advice, here’s what you need to know about investing in index funds. \nKey Takeaways\nIndex funds are mutual funds or ETFs whose portfolio mirrors that of a designated index, aiming to match its performance.\nOver the long term, index funds have generally outperformed other types of mutual funds.\nOther benefits of index funds include low fees, tax advantages (they generate less taxable income), and low risk (since they’re highly diversified).\nWhat Is an Index Fund? \nAn index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, with the goal of matching the performance of that benchmark as closely as possible. The S&P 500 is perhaps the most well-known index, but there are indexes—and index funds—for nearly every market and investment strategy you can think of. You can buy index funds through your brokerage account or directly from an index-fund provider, such as Fidelity. \nWhen you buy an index fund, you get a diversified selection of securities in one easy, low-cost investment. Some index funds provide exposure to thousands of securities in a single fund, which helps lower your overall risk through broad diversification. By investing in several index funds tracking different indexes you can built a portfolio that matches your desired asset allocation. For example, you might put 60% of your money in stock index funds and 40% in bond index funds. \nYou can start investing in index funds with one of the best online brokers and trading platforms, such as the ones below: \nIndex Fund: Pros\nVery low fees\nLower tax exposure\nPassive management tends to outperform over time\nBroad diversification\nIndex Fund: Cons\nNo downside protection\nDoesn't take advantage of opportunities\nCannot trim under-performers\nLack of professional portfolio management\nWhat Are the Benefits of Index Funds? \nThe most obvious advantage of index funds is that they have consistently beaten other types of funds in terms of total return. \nOne major reason is that they generally have much lower management fees than other funds because they are passively managed. Instead of having a manager actively trading, and a research team analyzing securities and making recommendations, the index fund’s portfolio just duplicates that of its designated index. \nIndex funds hold investments until the index itself changes (which doesn’t happen very often), so they also have lower transaction costs. Those lower costs can make a big difference in your returns, especially over the long haul. \n“Huge institutional investors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sits tight for decades,” wrote Buffett in his 2014 shareholder letter. “A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn, recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool’s game.”3 \nWhat's more, by trading in and out of securities less frequently than actively managed fund do, index funds generate less taxable income that must be passed along to their shareholders. \nIndex funds have still another tax advantage. Because they buy new lots of securities in the index whenever investors put money into the fund, they may have hundreds or thousands of lots to choose from when selling a particular security. That means they can sell the lots with the lowest capital gains and, therefore, the lowest tax bite. \nIf you're shopping for index funds, be sure to compare their expense ratios. While index funds are usually cheaper than actively managed funds, some are cheaper than others.\nWhat Are the Drawbacks of Index Funds? \nNo investment is ideal, and that includes index funds. One drawback lies in their very nature: A portfolio that rises with its index falls with its index. If you have a fund that tracks the S&P 500, for example, you’ll enjoy the heights when the market is doing well, but you’ll be completely vulnerable when the market drops. In contrast, with an actively managed fund, the fund manager might sense a market correction coming and adjust or even liquidate the portfolio’s positions to buffer it. \nIt’s easy to fuss about actively managed funds’ fees. But sometimes the expertise of a good investment manager can not only protect a portfolio, but even outperform the market. However, few managers have been able to do that consistently, year after year. \nAlso, diversification is a double-edged sword. It smooths out volatility and lessens risk, sure; but, as is so often the case, reducing the downside also limits the upside. The broad-based basket of stocks in an index fund may be dragged down by some underperformers, compared to a more cherry-picked portfolio in another fund. \nThe Bottom Line \nIndex funds have several attractive pros but also some cons to consider. The funds are passive investments that track major indexes making them a low-cost investment option. These funds are nearly as automatic and hands-off as using a robo-advisor which is another option for those looking for low-cost investing. Understanding what an index fund is and how it compares to other investments is the best first step you can take. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "What Are the Listing Requirements for the NASDAQ?\nMajor stock exchanges, like the Nasdaq, are exclusive clubs—their reputations rest on the companies they trade. As such, the Nasdaq won't allow just any company to be traded on its exchange. Only companies with a solid history and top-notch management behind them are considered. \nThe Nasdaq has four sets of listing requirements. Each company must meet at least one of the four requirement sets, as well as the main rules for all companies.1 \nKey Takeaways\nMajor stock exchanges, like the Nasdaq, are exclusive clubs—their reputations rest on the companies they trade.\nThe Nasdaq has four sets of listing requirements.\nEach company must meet at least one of the four requirement sets, as well as the main rules for all companies.\nIn addition to these requirements, companies must meet all of the criteria under a particular set of standards.\nA company has four ways to get listed on the Nasdaq, depending on the underlying fundamentals of the company.\nListing Requirements for All Companies \nEach listing firm must adhere to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Marketplace Rules for Nasdaq listings, including corporate governance rules 4350, 4351, and 4360.2 \nThe regular bid price of shares of the company's stock at the time of listing must be at least $4.00; however, a company may qualify under a closing price alternative of $3.00 or $2.00 if the company meets varying requirements. Typically, there must be at least three (or four depending on the criteria) market makers for the stock.3 \nCompanies must have a minimum of 1,250,000 publicly traded shares outstanding upon listing, excluding those held by officers, directors, or any beneficial owners of more than 10% of the company.45 \nTo stay listed on the Nasdaq, a company must continue to meet the minimum listing requirements or risk being delisted and removed from the Nasdaq exchange.\nCompanies must also have at least 450 round lot (i.e., 100 shares or more) shareholders, 2,200 total shareholders, or 550 total shareholders with 1.1 million average trading volume over the past 12 months.5\nDepending on the types of securities listed and the company's size, an application fee of $5,000 to $25,000 is required. Companies must also pay an entry fee, which can range from $50,000 to $270,000. There are also fees depending on the number of shares listed, which range from $100,000 to $150,000.67 \nThere are also several other fees, depending on the type of company, including an annual listing fee, small-cap fee for smaller companies, and fees for additional services or changes such as record-keeping and additional shares issued.8 \nIn addition to the above requirements, financial standards need to be met, depending on the type of security being listed, which are outlined below. \nRequired Financial Standards \nStandard No. 1: Earnings \nThe company must have aggregate pre-tax earnings in the prior three years of at least $11 million, in the previous two years at least $2.2 million, and no single year in the prior three years can have a net loss.1 \nStandard No. 2: Capitalization With Cash Flow \nThe company must have a minimum aggregate cash flow of at least $27.5 million for the past three fiscal years, with no negative cash flow in any of those three years. Also, its average market capitalization over the prior 12 months must be at least $550 million, and revenues in the previous fiscal year must be $110 million, minimum.1 \nStandard No. 3: Capitalization With Revenue \nCompanies can be removed from the cash flow requirement of the second standard if their average market capitalization over the past 12 months is at least $850 million and revenues over the prior fiscal year are at least $90 million.1 \nStandard No. 4: Assets With Equity \nCompanies can eliminate the cash flow and revenue requirements and decrease their market capitalization requirements to $160 million if their total assets total at least $80 million and their stockholders' equity is at least $55 million.1 \nHow Many Companies Are Currently Listed on the Nasdaq?\nAs of July 2023, there are over 3,300 companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The exchange has the highest trading volume of any U.S. exchange with approximately 1.8 billion trades per day.9\nWhat Famous Companies Are Listed on the Nasdaq?\nMany of today's famous companies, which are primarily technology companies, are listed on the Nasdaq. These companies include Apple, Microsoft, Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Amazon, Intel, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google). Famous non-tech companies include Costco, PepsiCo, and Starbucks.\nCan You Be Listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq?\nYes, companies can be listed on more than one exchange, known as a dual listing. In order to do so, a company must meet all of the listing requirements of each exchange. Companies, however, don't usually do this.\nThe Bottom Line \nA company has four ways to get listed on the Nasdaq, depending on the company's underlying fundamentals. If a company does not meet specific criteria, such as the operating income minimum, it has to make it up with larger minimum amounts in another area, like revenue. This helps to improve the quality of companies listed on the exchange. \nAfter a company gets listed on the market, it must maintain certain standards to continue trading. Failure to meet the specifications set out by the stock exchange will result in its delisting. Falling below the minimum required share price or market capitalization is one of the major factors triggering a delisting. The exact details of a delisting depend on the exchange. \nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research.

  "text": "Quantitative Analysis\nGuide to Quantitative Analysis\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAlpha measures how much an investment outperforms or underperforms a benchmark. Beta is a measurement of an investment’s volatility and is one measurement of an investment’s risk.\nBoth ratios exist to try and quantify the risk-adjusted return of an investment. The primary difference between the two is that the Sharpe Ratio measures an investment’s performance against the risk-free rate of return, the Treynor ratio measures it versus equity markets more broadly.\nYou calculate the beta of an investment by taking the covariance between the return of a specific investment and broader market return and then dividing that by the variance of broader market returns.\nA Sharpe Ratio over 1 indicates that an investment has a higher risk-adjusted return than the risk-free rate of return. The higher it is over 1 is how much better a risk-adjusted rate of return it has.\nKey Terms\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a mathematical model that seeks to illustrate a very simplified version of the relationship between risk and return on investments. Because of its simplicity, CAPM can’t precisely predict investment returns, but it can provide a good analytical baseline to understand capital markets.\nAlpha\nAlpha is a term used to refer to how much an investment outperforms the broader market. It is represented by the greek letter of the same name, α, in equations.\nBeta\nBeta is the term used to refer to the relative volatility of an investment versus that of the market as a whole. This can be used as a tool to measure the risk-adjusted return of the investment and is represented by the greek letter of the same name, β, in equations.\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe Ratio is a method for measuring the risk-adjusted return of an investment. It does this by comparing the investment to the risk-free rate of return over a certain time period.\nModern Portfolio Theory (MPT)\nInvented by Harry Markowitz and first published in 1952, MPT is one of the first quantitative analysis frameworks. MPT was made to help an investor choose investments that will match their risk tolerance.\nQuantitative Analysis (QA)\nQuantitative analysis broadly refers to using mathematical models and measurements to understand various topics. In investing it refers more specifically to a method of investment analysis that focuses on using mathematical and statistical models.\nFama and French Three Factor Model\nThe Fama and French Three Factor Model, often referred to as just the Fama and French Model, is an expanded version of the CAPM model. Instead of just looking at the systematic risk of a portfolio, it adds size and value premiums as additional variables to the model.\nTreynor Ratio\nThe Treynor Ratio is a method for measuring the risk-adjusted return of an investment. It does this by measuring an investment’s risk and return against that of the broader market.\nAlpha vs. Beta: What's the Difference?\nFama and French Three Factor Model Definition: Formula and Interpretation\nUnderstanding the Sharpe Ratio\nUnlevered Beta: Definition, Formula, Example, and Calculation\nArbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) Formula and How It's Used\nQuantitative Analysis (QA): What It Is and How It's Used in Finance\nHow Do You Calculate Beta in Excel?\nSortino Ratio: Definition, Formula, Calculation, and Example\nTreynor Ratio: What It Is, What It Shows, Formula To Calculate It\nWhat the Sharpe Ratio Means for Investors\nHow to Calculate Beta in Excel\nCAPM vs. Arbitrage Pricing Theory: What's the Difference?\nCAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages\nWhat Is Quantitative Trading?

  "text": "The Top 25 Stocks in the S&P 500\nThe S&P 500 consists of 500 companies that have issued a total of 503 stocks. Some companies, such as Alphabet, have issued multiple classes of shares. The top 10 largest holdings are listed on the official S&P Global website. An S&P 500 company must meet specific requirements to be included as a constituent within the index. \nHowever, S&P does not currently provide the total list of holdings, at least not for free. Subscribers to S&P's research unit, Capital IQ, can get access to the entire list. S&P 500 companies represent the top companies within their industries and are a gauge of U.S. economic activity.1 \nKey Takeaways\nThe S&P 500 includes some of the top companies that are leaders within their industries and represent a gauge of the U.S. economy.\nCompanies must meet certain requirement criteria, which are determined by the publishers of the index before being added to the S&P.\nThe S&P 500 index is market capitalization-weighted, where it gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market cap.\nA stock must meet certain criteria, including a total market cap of $14.5 billion, to join the S&P 500. \nCompanies may be removed from the S&P 500 if they deviate substantially from these standards.\nS&P 500 Inclusion Criteria \nThe S&P 500 was created in 1957 and is one of the most widely quoted stock market indexes. S&P 500 stocks represent the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. The S&P 500 focuses on the U.S. market's large-cap sector.2 \nAn S&P 500 company must meet a broad set of criteria to be added to the index, including the following: \nA total market capitalization of at least $14.5 billion\nMust be a U.S. company\nA float-adjusted liquidity ratio (FALR) greater than or equal to 0.75\nA positive sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters of trailing earnings\nPositive earnings for its most recent quarter\nMust meet certain liquidity requirements32\nCompanies may be removed from the S&P 500 if they deviate substantially from these standards.4 \n$39.7 Trillion\nThe total combined market cap of the 503 constituents in the S&P 500 as of Aug. 31, 2023.5\nS&P 500 Calculation \nThe S&P 500 is a free-float market capitalization-weighted index. Market capitalization represents the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding equity shares. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares of stock by the company's current stock price. For example, a company with 20 million shares outstanding in which its stock is selling for $100 per share would have a market cap of $2 billion.26 \nAs a result, the more valuable an individual company's stock becomes, the more it contributes to the S&P 500's overall return. It is not uncommon for three-quarters of the index's return to be linked to only 50 to 75 stocks. \nTherefore, the addition or subtraction of smaller companies from the index will not have a noticeable impact on the overall return of the index; however, the removal or addition of even just one of the largest stocks can have a major impact. \nS&P 500 Sector Breakdown \nBelow are the top sectors and their weightings within the S&P 500 index as of Aug. 31, 2023.7 \nBeing aware of the S&P's sector weighting is important because sectors with a smaller weighting may not have a material impact on the value of the overall index even if they're outperforming or underperforming the market. \nFor example, if oil prices are rising, leading to increased profits for the energy sector, those stocks represent only 4.4% of the S&P 500. As a result, oil stocks may not lead to a higher S&P if, for example, the more heavily weighted information technology sector is underperforming. \nS&P 500 components are weighted by free-float market capitalization, which means that larger companies can affect the value of the index to a greater degree.8\nTop 25 Components by Market Cap \nBecause the exact weightings of the top 25 components are not available from S&P directly, the weightings below are from the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). SPY is the oldest exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 and holds $406.6 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Sept. 20, 2023, and is highly traded.9 \nAs a result, the SPY's portfolio weightings provide a good proxy for investing in the underlying S&P 500 index, although the two may not be exactly the same. As of Sept. 21, 2023, the following are the 25 largest S&P 500 index constituents by weight: \nApple (AAPL): 7.05%\nMicrosoft (MSFT): 6.54%\nAmazon (AMZN): 3.24%\nNVIDIA (NVDA): 2.79%\nAlphabet Class A (GOOGL): 2.13%\nTesla (TSLA): 1.95%\nAlphabet Class C (GOOG): 1.83%\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B): 1.83%\nMeta (META), formerly Facebook, Class A: 1.81%\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH): 1.28%\nExxon Mobil (XOM): 1.27%\nEli Lilly (LLY): 1.21%\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM): 1.18%\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ): 1.07%\nVisa Class A (V): 1.05%\nProcter & Gamble (PG): 0.99%\nMastercard Class A (MA): 0.93%\nBroadcom (AVGO): 0.92%\nHome Depot (HD): 0.85%\nChevron Corporation (CVX): 0.81%\nMerck (MRK): 0.75%\nAbbVie (ABBV): 0.75%\nCostco (COST): 0.67%\nPepsiCo (PEP): 0.67%\nAdobe (ADBE): 0.65%10\nHow Many Companies Are in the S&P 500?\nAlthough there are generally 500 companies within the index, that number has grown. There were 503 stocks that made up the S&P 500 as of Aug. 31, 2023. That's because some companies have multiple classes of equity shares, such as Alphabet.11\nHow Are Companies Selected for the S&P 500?\nA company must meet certain requirements for inclusion in the S&P 500, which include:\nA market cap of at least $14.5 billion\nMust be a U.S. company\nA float-adjusted liquidity ratio (FALR) greater than or equal to 0.75\nPositive earnings over the most recent four consecutive quarters summed together\nA profitable earnings report for the company's most recent quarter\nLiquidity requirements32\nHow to Buy the S&P 500?\nSince the S&P 500 is an index, it can not be purchased directly; however, exchange-traded funds that mirror or track the index can be purchased, such as the State Street Global Advisors' SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY).\nThe Bottom Line \nThe top 25 companies in the S&P 500 are some of the most well-known companies in the world, a large portion of the top 10 being tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google. To invest in the companies in the index, investors can purchase the individual stocks of the companies or invest in a fund that tracks the S&P 500. \nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

  "text": "Investing Laws and Regulations\nIntroduction to Financial Regulations\nFrequently Asked Questions\nA pyramid scheme is a fraudulent business model premised on recruiting an ever-increasing number of investors whose fees and commissions are passed up the pyramid to earlier investors. Founders will recruit a few early investors whose return on investment depends on their ability to recruit more investors. This cycle of recruitment to profit repeats until eventually there’s no one left willing to join the “business” and the scheme implodes. “Investments” often include membership fees and the money new recruits pay for products they expect to resell.\nThe ponzi scheme run by Bernie Madoff for nearly two decades was pretty simple. Madoff convinced clients that he could manage their wealth and net them reliable annual returns that were good but not miraculous. Once he had their money, he would deposit it in a bank account rather than invest it. And when a client asked to cash out, he simply withdrew their initial investment plus 15% or so. All the while, Madoff used his reputation as a respected Wall Street insider and sensible wealth manger to recruit new clients whose investments were passed off as profit.\nBribery involves an explicit agreement between two parties, usually individuals, that one will help the other circumvent standard processes or laws in exchange for some form of compensation (usually money). Lobbying, on the other hand, does not involve an explicit agreement or conditions; instead, lobbyists liaise with politicians to advocate for policies on behalf of their clients and donate to political campaigns to help industry-friendly leaders win increasingly expensive elections.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a piece of legislation passed by Congress in 2010 in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The act created multiple new regulatory bodies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Financial Stability Oversight Committee. It also enacted the Volcker Rule, which limits the speculative investments that banks are allowed to make. Parts of Dodd-Frank were repealed by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act signed by President Donald Trump in 2018.\nKey Terms\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nThe SEC is a federal regulatory agency responsible for protecting investors and enforcing the fair and orderly functioning of securities markets. The agency was formed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to help restore investor confidence in public markets after the stock market crash of 1929.\nMoney Laundering\nMoney laundering is the process of making money gained by illegal activities appear to have come from a legitimate source. Money laundering is an essential part of the global drug trade and terrorist financing, which has compelled countries and financial institutions around the world to collaborate on anti-money laundering enforcement.\nHowey Test\nThe Howey Test refers to a standard established by the Supreme Court to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an “investment contract,” and thus should be regulated as a security. Under to the Howey Test, an investment contract exists if there is an “investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.”\nBasel III\nBasel III is an international accord enacted to enhance the stability of the international banking system by setting standards around liquidity, leverage, and reserve capital. Basel III, preceded by Basel I and II, was agreed upon by a consortium of 28 central banks in 2009 as part of an ongoing effort to control risk within the global banking system.\nTruth in Lending Act\nThe Truth in Lending Act is federal legislation enacted in 1968 that is meant to protect consumers in their dealings with creditors. The act requires lenders to clearly disclose the terms and cost of a loan so consumers understand their obligations and can compare offerings from different lenders.\nSEC Form 13F\nForm 13F is a disclosure that all institutional investors with more than $100 in assets under management are required to file quarterly. In it they report their equity holdings at the end of the quarter. It is sometimes considered an indicator of what the “smart money” is doing, but Form 13F has many shortcomings in this regard.\nAccredited Investor\nAn accredited investor is a person or entity who is allowed to invest in securities that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accredited investors have access to private equity and venture capital firms, which invest in companies that are not listed on public exchanges. The company selling the non-registered security is expected to verify an individual meets the income and net worth requirements to be an accredited investor.\nExplore Laws & Regulations\nWhat Is Cost and Freight (CFR) in Foreign Trade Contracts?\nStare Decisis: What It Means in Law, With Examples\nChecks and Balances: Definition, Examples, and How They Work\nMiFID II: Definition, Regulations, Who It Affects, and Purpose\nBasel Accords Guard Against Financial Shocks\nWhat Is Adjudication?

  "text": "When Stock Prices Drop, Where Is the Money?\nAs stock prices plummet, investors often wonder where their money has gone. In truth, it hasn't vanished—instead, the perceived value of their investment has changed. Stock price shifts are more about changing perceptions of value rather than money physically moving from one place to another. \nSay you buy 100 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) at $150 each. Later, supply chain issues arise, or a new Apple product underperforms. As a result, investors lose confidence in Apple's future performance, and the stock price drops to $100 per share. \nWhile it might seem like you've \"lost\" $50 per share, that money didn't go anywhere. The price change simply reflects what investors are now willing to pay for Apple shares. It's like how a new car's value depreciates over time—the actual vehicle hasn't changed, but its market value has. \nThis \"paper loss\" only becomes real if you sell your shares at a lower price. Understanding this concept is crucial for navigating the often turbulent waters of the stock market without getting sunk. \nKey Takeaways\nStock price drops reflect changes in perceived value, not actual money disappearing.\nIt can seem like that because market value losses aren't redistributed elsewhere but represent a decrease in overall market capitalization.\nShort sellers can profit from declining prices, but their gains don't come directly from long investors' losses.\nStock prices shift based on supply and demand, which depends on investor sentiment and company performance.\nUnderstanding these concepts can help investors make more informed decisions when there's market volatility.\nUnderstanding Why Stock Prices Change \nStock prices are fundamentally driven by supply and demand. When demand for a stock is high, meaning more people want to buy than sell it, the price rises as buyers are willing to pay more. But when supply exceeds demand, meaning more people are selling than buying, the stock price tends to fall, as sellers are forced to lower their prices to attract buyers. \nThis constant interaction between supply (the willingness to sell) and demand (the willingness to buy) drives prices and market trends. \nWhen Demand in a Stock Increases \nLet's look at what happens when prices for a stock are going up, using one of the most notable stock rises in recent memory. From 2020 to 2021, the stock price of Tesla (TSLA) surged over 700% despite the pandemic. Investors were bullish on Tesla's potential to dominate the electric vehicle market, its production expansion plans, and CEO Elon Musk's ambitious targets.1 \nBy January 2021, Tesla's market capitalization was over $800 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable automakers.2 This occurred even though Tesla produced only about 509,000 vehicles in 2020, far fewer than traditional automakers like Toyota and Volkswagen.3 \nWhen Demand in a Stock Drops \nLet's now review an example of a stock falling in price. In January 2022, Netflix (NFLX) reported disappointing subscriber growth for the fourth quarter of 2021, adding only 8.3 million new subscribers versus the expected 8.5 million. This might not seem like an astounding shortfall, but the news, coupled with concerns about rising competition, caused Netflix's stock to plummet 21.8% in a single day.45 \nInvestors were worried about slowing growth and potential market share loss to competitors like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max. Over the following months, Netflix's stock continued to fall as the company reported continued poor subscriber growth in the first half of 2022. By April 2022, Netflix's stock had dropped almost 70% from its all-time high.67 \nWhy Do Stock Prices Fall? \nMore needs to be said, though, about why prices fall, not just that they go down. Stock prices are influenced not just by a company's actual performance, which is part of its fundamentals, but by how investors perceive its prospects. Positive news, such as strong earnings reports or industry advances, can increase demand and higher prices. Negative news, like missed earnings targets or economic downturns, creates fear or uncertainty about stocks, leading to increased selling and lower prices. \nLet's go through the major reasons you can see a fall in the price of a stock: \nChanges in Investor Sentiment \nWhen a stock's price decreases, it affects investors in several ways. First, a decline in a stock's price directly reduces the market value of their holdings. For instance, if Apple's stock drops from $150 to $140, an investor with 100 shares loses $1,000 in market value. \nPrice drops also trigger fear and uncertainty among investors, leading to panic selling and creating a feedback loop of further price declines. We saw this in our example above when, in early 2022, Netflix's stock plummeted over 21% in one day after disappointing subscriber growth, prompting many investors to sell.5 \nIt's not that the intrinsic value changed immensely in a day, but that negative sentiment fed upon itself. This happens because a falling stock price can negatively influence perceptions of a company's health, leading to a further loss of confidence and stock price declines. \nThat said, investors react differently to price declines. Some view them as buying opportunities, believing the stock is now undervalued. Others may decide to cut their losses and sell. During the 2022 market correction, for example, some investors saw a drop in the price of Tesla's stock from its 2021 highs as a chance to buy at a discount.8 \nPoor Financial Performance \nWhen a company reports lower-than-expected earnings, profits, or revenue, it signals to investors that the business is underperforming. This very often leads to a sell-off as shareholders lose confidence in the company’s ability to grow, pushing stock prices lower. Missed earnings targets or profit warnings are key triggers for price declines. \nStock prices are a reflection of collective investor expectations. When those expectations change, so do stock prices.\nEconomic Recessions \nDuring periods of economic downturn or recession, consumer spending decreases, and business investments slow down. As companies experience reduced revenues and potential layoffs, their stock values tend to fall. Investors often pull out of equities in favor of safer assets, compounding the decline. \nBelow is chart showing the S&P 500 performance during recessions (along with major declines that didn't occur during or right before them): \nRising Interest Rates \nWhen central banks raise interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive for companies and consumers alike. Higher interest rates usually reduce corporate profits and consumer spending, which can drag down stock prices. In addition, rising rates make bonds and other fixed-income investments more attractive, leading investors to shift away from stocks. \nThe psychological impact of losing money in stocks can be significant. Successful investors learn to manage their emotions and stick to their long-term investment strategies, even during market downturns.\nGeopolitical Tensions \nGeopolitical risks such as wars, trade conflicts, or political instability can create uncertainty in financial markets. Investors often react to these risks by selling stocks, fearing economic disruption or volatility. This uncertainty can lead to widespread market declines, particularly in sectors sensitive to changes in global trade and security.\nMajor Shareholder Actions \nWhen large institutional investors sell substantial portions of their holdings, it can increase supply in the market, driving down prices. Such moves may be triggered by portfolio rebalancing or reactions to market conditions. These visible transactions can instill fear among smaller investors, leading to further declines. \nSector-Specific Problems \nEach industry has specific challenges, such as regulatory changes, supply chain disruptions, or technological obsolescence. For instance, stricter environmental regulations could hurt the energy sector, while rapid technological advances could render products obsolete in industries like telecommunications.\nWhile short-term price declines can be unsettling, they often create prospects for long-term investors. It's important to distinguish between temporary market noise and fundamental changes in a company's prospects.\nThe Effects of Stock Price Declines \nWhen a stock's price falls, the market value of the stock decreases, effectively \"erasing\" some of the perceived value. This lost value isn't transferred elsewhere; it reflects a shift in what investors believe the stock is worth, driven by changing expectations and sentiment. In short, your loss isn't necessarily someone else's gain. \nThe lost value in a stock's decline reflects a decrease in the company's market capitalization. When a stock's price drops because of decreased demand and negative investor sentiment, the company's overall market value—calculated as the stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares—shrinks. \nHere are other effects: \nThe stock may be more sensitive to market changes: As stock prices decline, particularly if they fall below certain thresholds (like $5), they become more sensitive to market moves. Often, stocks crossing below the $5 mark have increased volatility and risk.\nCompany financing is more difficult: A prolonged decline in stock prices can also affect a company's ability to raise capital. When Ford Motor Company (F) faced declining share prices because of poor sales forecasts in 2020, it struggled to attract investors to boost its share price.9 Lower share prices may deter potential investors or lenders, affecting the company's growth prospects and overall financial health.\nDividends and returns may adjust: A lower stock price might not immediately affect the dividend if the company pays one. However, if the price drop reflects underlying financial trouble within the company, future dividend payments might be reduced or eliminated, affecting income-seeking investors.\nLower stock prices can also affect long-term returns. For long-term investors, a significant drop can take years to recover, potentially delaying or reducing overall investment returns. However, stocks are historically resilient and bounce back after market declines, usually within a few months to a few years. \nHow To Prepare for Stock Price Declines \nYou can take several measures to prepare for potential stock market corrections or for a partial decline in your stock portfolio value: \nBuy and Hold \nThe buy-and-hold strategy involves buying stocks and holding them for the long term, regardless of market fluctuations. Using this approach, investors ride out market volatility. This has often been the right move since, historically, stock prices have trended higher. \nInvestors should avoid the pitfalls of panic selling during downturns by focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term price movements. This strategy is particularly effective for investors who believe in the fundamental strength of their investments and have a time horizon that allows them to weather market storms. \nBroad market indexes such as the S&P 500 are composed of hundreds of companies varying in industry, operational strategy, and sometime size, depending on the index. Investing in these types of indexes is a simple way to diversify.\nDiversification \nOne of the best ways to prepare for a stock market correction or crash is by diversifying your portfolio. Holding a mix of assets—stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities—helps spread risk. When one asset class declines, others may hold steady or increase in value and this protects your overall portfolio. \nDiversification across sectors, geographies, and company sizes further mitigates risk during market downturns.\nKeep Cash On Hand \nHolding part of your portfolio in cash or cash equivalents gives you a lot of flexibility during market corrections. You can take advantage of lower stock prices by buying quality assets at lower prices. \nCash reserves also act as a safety net, ensuring you don't need to sell other assets at a loss during a downturn. \nYou should also have an emergency fund that ensures you have liquid assets available in case of personal financial difficulties or during market crashes when stock values are down. Having three-to-six months’ worth of living expenses set aside in a high-yield savings account allows you to avoid selling investments at a loss in volatile markets. \nManage Your Risks \nImplementing risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders or using options strategies, can help protect your investments during market downturns. Stop-loss orders automatically sell stocks when they reach a certain price, limiting potential losses. \nOptions strategies, such as buying put options, can provide insurance against declines in stock prices. \nOptions are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price, until a specified date. If you own a stock and want to reduce how badly any losses might affect you, you could hedge your risk by selling put options against your shares.\nInvest in Defensive Stocks \nDefensive stocks—such as those in the consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare sectors—tend to perform better during economic downturns and market corrections. These companies provide essential goods and services, making them less vulnerable to shifts in economic conditions. \nIntrinsic vs. Market Value \nWhen evaluating a company's worth, investors consider two main types of value: intrinsic and market.\nIntrinsic Value \nOtherwise called the fundamental value, intrinsic value is what's taken to be an objective estimate of a stock's actual worth. These are used to assess its value: \nFuture cash flows\nGrowth rate\nRisks facing the company\nThe firm's overall financial health\nHere are the essential characteristics of intrinsic value: \nObjectivity: Based on a fundamental analysis of the company\nCalculation: Often uses discounted cash flow and other models\nStability: Generally more stable than market value\nPurpose: Used to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued\nMarket Value \nMarket value is the current price at which a stock trades in the market. It represents what investors are willing to pay for the stock at a given time. \nKey points about market value: \nBased on supply and demand in the stock market\nCan fluctuate widely \nMay not always reflect the company's fundamental value\nStudying historical prices and technical indicators help analysts try to predict future market value\nDifferences Between Intrinsic and Market Values\nIntrinsic Value\nBased on a fundamental analysis of the company\nUsed for assessing future potential and growth prospects.\nMore stable over time\nObjective, though it can vary based on analyst assumptions\nMarket Value\nBased on the trading price in the stock market\nReflects what investors are willing to pay at a given time\nCan be highly volatile\nSubjective, influenced by market sentiment and trends\nUnrealized vs. Realized Losses \nAnother crucial distinction is between unrealized and realized losses. These concepts have different implications for your portfolio and taxes. \nUnrealized or \"paper losses,\" occur when the market value of a stock decreases, but the asset hasn't been sold yet. For example, if you bought 100 shares at $50 each, your total investment is $5,000. If the stock price drops to $30 per share, the market value is $3,000, producing an unrealized loss of $2,000. The loss is called \"unrealized\" because it exists only on paper; you still hold the shares and could see the stock recover in time. \nInvestors looking to offset gains from other assets may opt to sell stocks in a losing position to offset them for tax purposes. This is called tax-loss harvesting.\nUnrealized losses don't have immediate tax implications because they aren't recognized until the shares are sold. Many investors hold onto their investments during market downturns, hoping prices will rebound and allow them to make up for their losses. Those who believe a company's fundamentals are stronger than the stock price often do this. \nMeanwhile, realized losses occur when an investor sells an asset for less than its purchase price. Going back to the example above, if you sell 100 shares at $30 each, you would receive $3,000. Since you originally invested $5,000, this ends in a realized loss of $2,000. Unlike unrealized losses, realized losses must be reported on tax returns and can affect your taxable income by lowering it.10 \nThat's good for tax purposes since it might offset realized gains from other investments. However, once a loss is realized, there's no chance of recovery from that specific investment unless the investor decides to repurchase the stock. \nThe decision to realize a loss or continue holding an investment depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall market outlook. While unrealized losses may recover over time if the stock price rebounds, realized losses provide certainty and potential tax benefits. However, they eliminate the possibility of gaining from the stock recovering afterward.\nDifferences Between Unrealized and Realized Losses\nUnrealized Losses\nDefinition: Loss that exists on paper because you haven't sold the stock.\nAffect on your portfolio: Reduces the paper value of your portfolio, but has no immediate financial impact.\nTax implications: No tax impact since no transaction has occurred.\nPotential for recovery: The stock could recover and turn into a profit if held longer.\nRealized Losses\nDefinition: Actual loss that occurs when you sell the stock for less than you paid.\nAffect on your portfolio: Results in a reduction of your investment capital.\nTax implications: Can be used to offset capital gains or reduce taxable income.\nPotential for recovery: No chance of recovery on the realized loss unless you reinvest.\nShort Selling: Profiting From Stock Declines \nShort selling is a trading strategy where investors bet on the decline of a stock's price. It involves borrowing shares of a stock from a broker and selling them immediately at the market price. The short seller aims to buy back the shares later at a lower price, return them to the broker, and pocket the difference. \nHere are the steps in how short sellers profit: \nBorrow and sell: The short seller borrows shares of a stock and sells them at the market price. For example, if they borrow and sell the stock at $50 per share, they receive $50.\nPrice declines: If the stock price drops, as the short seller expects, they can buy the shares back at the lower price.\nBuy back and return: If the price falls to $30, the investor can buy back the shares at this new, lower price. They repurchase the shares at the reduced price ($30 in this case) and return them to the broker. The profit is the difference between the selling and buying prices, minus any fees or interest on the borrowed shares.\nHowever, if a stock price rises instead of falling, the potential losses for short sellers are unlimited, since they would have to buy the shares back at a much higher price.\nStock price declines don't always reflect a company's intrinsic value. It's crucial to understand the difference between short-term market reactions and fundamental changes in a company's prospects.\nImpact of Short Selling on Other Shareholders \nShort selling can have both direct and indirect effects on regular long investors. When investors take short positions, they are essentially betting that a stock’s price will fall. As a result, significant short-selling activity can create downward pressure on the stock price, negatively affecting long-term investors holding the stock. \nHowever, short selling can also benefit long investors in certain scenarios. Short sellers often help expose overvalued stocks or companies with questionable fundamentals, which could prevent long investors from holding onto a poor investment for too long. \nIn addition, when short sellers eventually cover their positions by buying back shares, this can create upward momentum in the stock price, potentially leading to a price recovery that benefits long-term shareholders.\nThe Stock Market is Not a Zero-Sum Game \nUnlike options trading, where another's loss directly offsets one party's gain, the stock market is not a zero-sum game. In stock investing, many investors can benefit from a company's growth and success. \nOne exception is options trading. When an investor buys a call option on stock XYZ with a strike price of $50 for $5, they're betting the stock price will rise above $55 (strike price plus premium). If the stock reaches $60, the option buyer profits $5 per share, while the option seller loses the same amount. This direct correlation between profit and loss defines something as a zero-sum game. \nThe stock market operates differently. When a company performs well and its stock price increases, all shareholders benefit without directly causing losses to others—the rising tide lifts all boats. For instance, if Company ABC's stock rises from $100 to $150, every shareholder sees their investment value increase. This is quintessential to what market proponents call \"value creation.\" \nIn addition, stocks can generate value through dividends and buybacks, further distinguishing them from zero-sum investments. When a company pays dividends, it distributes profits to shareholders without necessarily reducing the value of others' holdings. Similarly, stock buybacks can increase the value of remaining shares without directly disadvantaging any particular group of investors. \nHowever, while the stock market isn't zero-sum in the long term, short-term trading and speculation can sometimes resemble zero-sum activities. Day or high-frequency traders might engage in transactions where one party's gain more closely mirrors another's loss. However, these activities are a small fraction of the overall stock market. \nMarket Crashes \nStock market crashes provide stark examples of how massive value can seemingly disappear from the market in a short period. Two of the most notable crashes in U.S. history—the 1929 crash and the 2008 financial crisis—illustrate how stocks aren't a zero-sum game in the other direction either: stock price drops destroy value without anyone necessarily gaining.11 \nThe stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the Great Depression. On Black Monday, October 28, 1929, the stock market fell nearly 13% in a single day. The following day, on October 29, 1929, known as Black Tuesday, the stock market fell again nearly 12%.12 Between September 1, and November 30th 1929, the market's value declined from $64 billion to around $30 billion. The loss of $34 billion in value is equivalent to over $626 billion in 2024 dollars.13 \nThis catastrophic decline was fueled by rampant speculation, overleveraging, and a lack of regulatory oversight. As stock prices fell, investor confidence evaporated, leading to panic selling. By 1932, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 89% from its peak in 1929.12 The repercussions were felt throughout the economy: businesses failed, banks collapsed, and unemployment soared to around 25%.14 \nFast forward to 2008, when the global financial crisis began with a sharp decline in housing prices and widespread defaults on subprime mortgages. As financial institutions became increasingly exposed to these toxic assets, confidence in the banking system eroded. \nIn September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, marking a pivotal moment that sent shock waves through financial markets worldwide.15 The S&P 500 index fell from its peak in October 2007 to its trough in March 2009.16 During this period, an estimated $17 trillion in household wealth evaporated because of falling stock prices and declining home values.17 \nThe crisis resulted in severe economic consequences: unemployment peaked at around 10%, millions lost their homes and consumer spending plummeted, causing massive ripple effects in just about every part of the economy.11 The government intervened with unprecedented measures such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program and aggressive monetary policies, including quantitative easing, to stabilize the economy.\nWhat Should I Do When a Stock I Own Drops in Price?\nOne of the most important things to do is remain calm and consider both the time frame for your investment and the reason you bought the stock in the first place. Stocks can have a lot of short-term volatility following announcements and other events.\nYou can certainly revisit or potentially change your investment based on these developments. If a sell-off occurs, it might represent a buying opportunity for you and a chance to add to your long position at a relatively low price rather than selling with the crowd. The main point is to practice trading discipline and keep your eye on long-term, not short-term, volatility.\nHow Do Short Sellers Profit From Declining Stock Prices?\nShort sellers profit by borrowing shares and selling them at the current higher price, then buying them back later at a lower price. The difference between the higher selling price and the lower repurchase price is their profit.\nWhat Are the Psychological Factors That Influence Stock Market Movements?\nPsychological factors include fear, greed, herd behavior, and overreaction to news. These emotions can drive investors to buy or sell irrationally, causing market prices to fluctuate beyond what fundamentals would suggest.\nThe Bottom Line \nWhen stock prices drop, the perceived disappearance of money is primarily a result of changing investor perceptions and market dynamics rather than an actual loss of capital. A decline in stock prices indicates a shift in supply and demand, often driven by negative sentiment or disappointing news, leading to more sellers than buyers. \nThis creates the illusion that money has vanished. However, it simply reflects reduced market capitalization because of lower investor demand. The \"lost\" value isn't transferred to anyone but represents a collective reassessment of the company's worth. \nUnderstanding this concept is crucial for navigating the often turbulent waters of the stock market. Investors should remember that unrealized losses only become real if shares are sold at a lower price.",

  "text": "Understanding Small-Cap and Big-Cap Stocks\nThe meanings of big-cap and small-cap are generally understood by their names, which indicate how valuable they are in terms of market capitalization. Big-cap stocks—also referred to as large-cap stocks—are shares of larger companies. Small-cap stocks, on the other hand, are shares of smaller companies. \nLabels like these can often be misleading because many people run under the assumption that they can only make money by investing in large-cap stocks. And that can't be further from the truth—especially nowadays. If you don't realize how big small-cap stocks have become, you could miss some potentially promising investment opportunities. \nSmall-cap stocks are often attractive due to their lower relative valuations and potential to grow into big-cap stocks eventually, but the dollar-amount definition of a small-cap has changed over time. What was once considered a big-cap stock in previous decades may be thought of as a small-cap stock today. This article will define the caps and provide additional information to help investors understand terms that are often taken for granted. \nKey Takeaways\nBig-cap (large-cap) stocks have a market cap of $10 billion or more.\nSmall-cap stocks generally have a market cap of $250 million to $2 billion.\nSmall-cap stocks shouldn't be overlooked when putting together a diverse portfolio.\nBig-cap stocks don’t always mean larger returns on investment.\nMid-cap stocks fall somewhere in between small-caps and big-caps.\nScaling up Stocks \nBefore we do anything else, we first need to define the word cap—which is short for capitalization. The term in its entirety, though, is market capitalization or market cap. This is the market's estimate of the total dollar value of a company's outstanding shares.1 \nTo get this figure, you need to multiply the price of a stock by the number of shares outstanding.1 One thing to keep in mind, though, is that though this is the common conception of market capitalization, you actually need to add the market value of any of the company's publicly traded bonds to calculate the total market value of a company. \nThe market cap shows the size of the company, which is something of interest to most investors. That's because it generally points out several of a company's key characteristics, including its risk assessment. Although the value of small-cap stocks may vary from broker to broker, the general consensus today is that they have market caps ranging from $250 million to $2 billion.1 \nOne misconception people have about small-caps is that they are startup companies or are just brand-new entities that are breaking out. But many small-cap companies are just like their larger counterparts in that they have strong track records, are well established, and have great financials. And because they are smaller, small-cap share prices have a greater chance of growth.1 This means they have more potential for investors to earn money faster. \nIn general, small-cap stocks are thought to be more volatile than big-cap stocks and thus provide both greater risk but also opportunity. This is because big-cap stocks are often larger, more mature companies that are not seeking aggressive growth.\nThe Big-Caps \nBig-cap stocks refer to the largest publicly traded companies, with market caps of more than $10 billion, like General Electric and Walmart.1 These companies are also called blue-chip stocks—companies with a history of dependable earnings, solid reputations, and strong financials. Some examples of blue-chip stocks are IBM Corp., Microsoft, Coca-Cola Co., and Boeing Co.2 Though companies like these tend to perform well and provide safe returns for investors, you should not see this as a blanket expectation for all large-caps. \nIn general, big-cap stocks are established, mature, and stable. They tend to be less volatile and reward investors with stable and growing dividend streams. However, some investors have the misconception that the large-cap moniker means there is no risk at all. There have been several cases in financial history that point to the opposite. \nEnron is just one example. It serves to demonstrate that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. The company, which was a darling of the energy industry, was the subject of an accounting scandal. The company used mark to market (MTM) accounting to make the company look like it was much more profitable than it actually was. Its subsidiaries were losing money, but the company continued to hide its losses and debt, using off-balance-sheet entities to mask toxic assets. The company buckled and ended up filing for bankruptcy.3 Key personnel, including CEO Jeffrey Skilling and the company's accounting firm, faced criminal charges.4 \nThe lesson? Just because it's a large-cap doesn't mean it's always a great investment. You still have to do your research, which means looking at other, smaller companies that can provide you with a great basis for your overall investment portfolio. \nDow vs. Nasdaq: The average market cap for the Dow remains much larger than the average market cap for the Nasdaq 100.56\nThe Small-Caps \nSmall-cap stocks, as the name implies, are far smaller in terms of market valuation—but also, generally, scale, scope, and influence. These companies have a market cap of $250 million to $2 billion and are found in all business types, economic sectors, and growth phases.1 \nOne common misconception about small-caps is that they are startups or brand-new companies. In reality, many small-cap companies are well-established businesses with strong track records and great financials. And because they are smaller, small-cap share prices have a greater chance of growth. \nHistorically, small-cap stocks may have outperformed large-cap stocks.7 However, whether smaller or larger companies perform better varies over time from period to period based on other factors like the broader economic climate.8 For instance, big-caps seem to hold their own better during bear markets and recessions.9 \nAt the same time, small-cap stocks tend to be more volatile (and thus riskier) than their larger-cap peers. It often takes less trading volume to move their prices, and it is common for a small-cap stock's price to fluctuate more in a single trading day than those of larger companies. That is something that many investors simply cannot stomach, but it does attract more active traders like day traders. Note that because these stocks often have less liquidity, it is also more difficult to exit a position at the market price. \nRanking Market Capitalizations \nThe definitions of big- or large-cap and small-cap stocks differ slightly from one brokerage company to the next and have changed over time. The differences between the brokerage definitions are relatively superficial and only matter for the companies that lie on their edges. The classifications are important for borderline companies because mutual funds use these definitions to determine which stocks to buy. \nThe current approximate definitions are as follows: \nMega-cap: Market cap of $200 billion and greater10\nBig-cap: $10 billion and greater, up to $200 billion\nMid-cap: $2 billion to $10 billion\nSmall-cap: $250 million to $2 billion1\nMicro-cap: $50 million to $250 million\nNano-cap: Under $50 million11\nThese categories have increased over time along with the market indexes. And it is important to note that these definitions are fluid and not fixed—they are relative. For example, in several circles, stocks with market caps greater than $100 billion are seen as mega-caps. \nRemember market capitalization is based on the stock price and therefore the perceived value of a company, not the actual value.1\nShifting Numbers \nThe big-cap stocks get most of Wall Street's attention because that's where you'll find the lucrative investment banking business. Large-cap stocks make up the majority of the equity market in the United States, which is why they make up the nuclei of many investors' portfolios. \nMega-cap stocks, on the other hand, tend to shift in numbers. There were at least 7 of these stocks in existence in 2007, but that number shrunk by 2010 due to the 2008 mortgage meltdown and the Great Recession.1213 In the years since, mega-cap stocks have made a resurgence, and behemoths such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have reached historic market-cap highs approaching $2 trillion each. As of 2022, the total number of mega-cap companies around the world is around 48.14 \nBut what about small-caps? Remember, just because they have a smaller market cap doesn't mean you won't find value or great returns. In fact, you can find much of the value in the stock market in small-cap stocks because some of them have some of the strongest track records around. \nWhat Are Some Characteristics of Big-Cap Stocks?\nAside from having a market capitalization of $10 billion or more, large-cap stocks also tend to be those of older, more mature corporations. These companies may be more likely to pay regular dividends to their shareholders because they see stable, established sources of income and profitability. Large-caps are typically market leaders and household names, many of which are also blue-chip stocks.\nWhat Are Some of the Risks of Investing in Small-Cap Stocks?\nSmall-cap stocks can be great growth opportunities, but investors should also be aware of the risks associated with smaller companies' stocks. First, they tend to be more volatile, meaning that price swings and drawdowns can be larger than with bigger companies' stocks. These shares may also be less liquid and more thinly traded, with larger bid-ask spreads, making it more costly to enter and exit positions.\nAt the company level, smaller companies may have a harder time accessing funding or raising capital than larger companies do. This can be a limiting factor for operations and growth.\nWhat Indexes Track Big-Cap Stocks?\nIf you want to invest in big-caps, you can look to index funds or ETFs that track indexes such as the S&P 500 (the 500 largest companies in the U.S.) or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which covers 30 blue-chip stocks.15\nWhat Indexes Track Small-Cap Stocks?\nWhich Are Better: Big-Caps or Small-Caps?\nThis will depend on the type of investor you are. If you have a greater risk tolerance and longer time horizons, small-cap stocks tend to outperform big-caps over time because they are able to grow more rapidly than larger companies. If you prefer stable appreciation and dividend income, big-caps may be more suitable. In general, investors are encouraged to diversify and hold a mix of stocks containing both large and small companies.\nThe Bottom Line \nThe big and small labels are also attached to the major stock exchanges and indexes, which also leads to confusion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is viewed as consisting of only big-cap stocks while the Nasdaq is often viewed as being comprised of small-cap stocks. These perceptions were generally true before 1990, but have since changed. Since the tech boom, the market caps of the stock exchanges and indexes vary and overlap. \nLabels such as big and small are subjective, relative, and change over time. Big does not always mean less risky, but the big-caps are the stocks most closely followed by Wall Street analysts. This attention, however, generally means that there are no value plays in the big-cap arena. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Adjusted Closing Price: How It Works, Types, Pros & Cons\nWhat Is the Adjusted Closing Price? \nThe adjusted closing price amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions. It is often used when examining historical returns or doing a detailed analysis of past performance. \nKey Takeaways\nThe adjusted closing price amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions.\nThe closing price is the raw price, which is just the cash value of the last transacted price before the market closes.\nThe adjusted closing price factors in corporate actions, such as stock splits, dividends, and rights offerings.\nThe adjusted closing price can obscure the impact of key nominal prices and stock splits on prices in the short term.\nUnderstanding the Adjusted Closing Price \nStock values are stated in terms of the closing price and the adjusted closing price. The closing price is the raw price, which is just the cash value of the last transacted price before the market closes. The adjusted closing price factors in anything that might affect the stock price after the market closes. \nA stock's price is typically affected by the supply and demand of market participants. However, some corporate actions, such as stock splits, dividends, and rights offerings, affect a stock's price. Adjustments allow investors to obtain an accurate record of the stock's performance. Investors should understand how corporate actions are accounted for in a stock's adjusted closing price. It is especially useful when examining historical returns because it gives analysts an accurate representation of the firm's equity value. \nTypes of Adjustments \nAdjusting Prices for Stock Splits \nA stock split is a corporate action intended to make the firm’s shares more affordable for average investors. A stock split does not change a company's total market capitalization, but it does affect the company's stock price. \nFor example, a company's board of directors may decide to split the company's stock 3-for-1. Therefore, the company's shares outstanding increase by a multiple of three, while its share price is divided by three. Suppose a stock closed at $300 the day before its stock split. In this case, the closing price is adjusted to $100 ($300 divided by 3) per share to maintain a consistent standard of comparison. Similarly, all other previous closing prices for that company would be divided by three to obtain the adjusted closing prices. \nAdjusting for Dividends \nCommon distributions that affect a stock's price include cash dividends and stock dividends. The difference between cash dividends and stock dividends is that shareholders are entitled to a predetermined price per share and additional shares, respectively. \nFor example, assume a company declared a $1 cash dividend and was trading at $51 per share before then. All other things being equal, the stock price would fall to $50 because that $1 per share is no longer part of the company's assets. However, the dividends are still part of the investor's returns. By subtracting dividends from previous stock prices, we obtain the adjusted closing prices and a better picture of returns. \nAdjusting for Rights Offerings \nA stock's adjusted closing price also reflects rights offerings that may occur. A rights offering is an issue of rights given to existing shareholders, which entitles the shareholders to subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to their shares. That will lower the value of existing shares because supply increases have a dilutive effect on the existing shares. \nFor example, assume a company declares a rights offering, in which existing shareholders are entitled to one additional share for every two shares owned. Assume the stock is trading at $50, and existing shareholders can purchase additional shares at a subscription price of $45. After the rights offering, the adjusted closing price is calculated based on the adjusting factor and the closing price. \nBenefits of the Adjusted Closing Price \nThe main advantage of adjusted closing prices is that they make it easier to evaluate stock performance. Firstly, the adjusted closing price helps investors understand how much they would have made by investing in a given asset. Most obviously, a 2-for-1 stock split does not cause investors to lose half their money. Since successful stocks often split repeatedly, graphs of their performance would be hard to interpret without adjusted closing prices. \nSecondly, the adjusted closing price allows investors to compare the performance of two or more assets. Aside from the clear issues with stock splits, failing to account for dividends tends to understate the profitability of value stocks and dividend growth stocks. Using the adjusted closing price is also essential when comparing the returns of different asset classes over the long term. For example, the prices of high-yield bonds tend to fall in the long run. That does not mean these bonds are necessarily poor investments. Their high yields offset the losses and more, which can be seen by looking at the adjusted closing prices of high-yield bond funds. \nThe adjusted closing price provides the most accurate record of returns for long-term investors looking to design asset allocations.\nCriticism of the Adjusted Closing Price \nThe nominal closing price of a stock or other asset can convey useful information. This information is destroyed by converting that price into an adjusted closing price. In actual practice, many speculators place buy and sell orders at certain prices, such as $100. As a result, a sort of tug of war can take place between bulls and bears at these key prices. If the bulls win, a breakout may occur and send the asset price soaring. Similarly, a win for the bears can lead to a breakdown and further losses. The adjusted close stock price obscures these events. \nBy looking at the actual closing price at the time, investors can get a better idea of what was going on and understand contemporary accounts. If investors look at historical records, they will find many examples of tremendous public interest in nominal levels. Perhaps the most famous is the role that Dow 1,000 played in the 1966 to 1982 secular bear market. During that period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) repeatedly hit 1,000, only to fall back shortly after that. The breakout finally took place in 1982, and the Dow never dropped below 1,000 again.1 This phenomenon is covered up somewhat by adding dividends to obtain the adjusted closing prices. \nIn general, adjusted closing prices are less useful for more speculative stocks. Jesse Livermore provided an excellent account of the impact of key nominal prices, such as $100 and $300, on Anaconda Copper in the early 20th century. In the early 21st century, similar patterns occurred with Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA). William J. O'Neil gave examples where stock splits, far from being irrelevant, marked the beginnings of real declines in the stock price.2 While arguably irrational, the impact of nominal prices on stocks could be an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Basic Materials Sector: Definition, Examples, and Stocks\nThe Basic Materials Sector: An Overview \nThe basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products, and forestry products. \nWithin this sector are the companies that supply most of the materials used in construction. That makes the companies and their stocks sensitive to changes in the business cycle. They tend to thrive when the economy is strong. \nThe category is sometimes referred to simply as the materials sector. \nBasic Materials Explained \nCompanies in the basic materials sector are involved in the physical acquisition, development, and initial processing of the many products commonly referred to as raw materials. Oil, gold, and stone are examples. \nKey Takeaways\nThe basic materials sector is made up of companies involved in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials, from gold and oil to timber.\nThe raw materials they finish are sold for use in nearly all other industry sectors.\nThe sector is particularly sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy.\nFor the most part, raw materials are naturally occurring resources. Some are considered finite. That is, it takes millions of years for them to develop, well outside the long-range plans of any company. Others are reusable but are not available in infinite quantities at any given point in time. \nThe Basic Materials Stock Sector \nFor the purposes of stock categorization, the most common materials within the sector are mined products, such as metals and ore, and forestry products, or lumber. The stocks of certain chemical producers and energy sources also are included in the basic materials sector. \nContainers and packaging are categorized as basic materials, whether they're made of glass, metal, or cardboard. \nBasic Materials or Not? \nNot all businesses that work with basic materials are included in the sector. For example, while a metal mining company is considered a basic materials processor, a jewelry company, even one which works only with mined metal, is not. It is deemed a retailer or a wholesaler who is a buyer of the basic material. \nNot even all chemicals qualify as basic materials. For example, industrial fertilizers and paint additives are categorized as complex cleaning products or pharmaceuticals. \nMore than 200 mutual funds, index funds, and ETFs focus their investments in the basic materials sector.\nEnergy Sources \nCertain energy sources, notably natural gas, are considered basic materials. Crude oil and coal qualify in their natural state as do some refined products such as gasoline. \nThe refined versions of these products are included because the demand for them is nearly universal. They are critical to the operation of almost every industry. \nDemand for Basic Materials \nThe basic materials sector is subject to the law of supply and demand in the same way as consumer goods are. In fact, they are closely interrelated. If the demand for consumer goods drops, the demand for the raw materials involved in their production also drops. \nThe basic materials sector also is affected by shifts in the housing market as many raw materials are finished in order to be used in construction projects. If new housing development slows, the demand for lumber products decreases. \nKey Takeaways\nThe basic materials sector is made up of companies involved in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials.\nMost industries rely on companies in this sector for the raw materials they need to manufacture their goods.\nBasic materials are substances that occur naturally such as oil, stone, and gold.\nThe basic materials sector is subject to supply and demand.\nExamples of Basic Materials Companies \nThree of the biggest American companies are included in the basic materials sector, and all three are involved in the oil business. These are Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and the oil field services company Schlumberger Ltd. \nDuPont de Nemours and Co. and Monsanto Co., both chemicals companies, are listed in this sector. So are two big producers of construction materials, Vulcan Materials Co., a producer of crushed stone, gravel, and concrete, and Steel Dynamics Inc., a maker of finished steel products. \nBasic Materials Stocks \nMore than 300 stock mutual funds, index funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focus on investments in the basic materials sector.1 \nThe many ETFs include Vanguard's Vanguard Materials ETF, Blackrock's iShares Global Materials ETF, and iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF.2 3 4 \nMutual funds in the sector sometimes focus narrowly on one segment, such as the Fidelity Select Chemicals Fund and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF.5 6 \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "S&P 500 Average Return and Historical Performance\nWhat Is the S&P 500 Index? \nThe S&P 500 is a market capitalization-weighted index of the 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S. The index is operated by Standard & Poor's Dow Jones Indices, which is a division of S&P Global. While it assumed its present size (and name) in 1957, the S&P dates back to the 1920s, becoming a composite index tracking 90 stocks in 1926.1 The average annualized return since its inception in 1928 through Dec. 31, 2023, is 9.90%.2 The average annualized return since adopting 500 stocks into the index in 1957 through Dec. 31, 2023, is 10.26%.3 \nThe average annual return (AAR) is the percentage showing the return of a mutual fund in a given period. In other words, it measures a fund's long-term performance, so it's a vital tool for investors considering a mutual fund investment.\nKey Takeaways\nThe S&P 500 is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S.\nThe index acts as a benchmark of the performance of the U.S. stock market overall, dating back to the 1920s.\nThe index has returned a historic annualized average return of around 10.26% since its 1957 inception through the end of 2023.\nWhile that average number may sound attractive, timing is everything: Get in at a high or out at a relative low, and you will not enjoy such returns.\nThe History of the S&P 500 \nDuring the first decade after its introduction in 1957, and reflecting the economic expansion in the U.S after World War II, the value of the index rose to slightly over 800.\nFrom 1969 to 1981, the index gradually declined to fall under 360 as a sign of high inflation.4\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the S&P 500 fell 56.8% from October 2007 to March 2009.5\nThe S&P bounced back from the crisis and continued its 10-year bull run from 2009 to 2019 to climb 330%.6\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent recession caused the S&P 500 to plummet over 15%.\nThe S&P 500 recovered during the second half of 2020, reaching several all-time highs in 2021, but dropped more than 1,500 points in 2022 before rebounding in October 2023.4\nS&P 500 Historical Returns \nHow Inflation Affects S&P 500 Returns \nInflation is one of the major problems for an investor hoping to recreate that 10.13% average return regularly. Adjusted for inflation, the historical average annual return is only around 6.37%.3 There is an additional problem posed by the question of whether that inflation-adjusted average is accurate since the adjustment is made using the inflation figures from the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the index that some analysts believe vastly understates the true inflation rate. \nHow Market Timing Affects S&P 500 Returns \nAnother major factor in annual returns for an investor in the S&P 500 is when they choose to enter the market. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which duplicates the index, performed very well for an investor who bought between 2014 and 2018 despite some negativity in their returns between 2020 and 2023.7 \nInvestors who buy during market lows and hold their investment or sell at market highs will experience larger returns than those who buy during market highs, particularly if they sell during dips. \nAttempting to time the market is not advised, particularly for beginning investors.\nStock purchase timing plays a role in returns, but there are long periods between lows and highs. It is also difficult to know or predict these events. For those who want to avoid the missed opportunity of selling during market lows but don't want the risk of active trading, dollar-cost averaging is an option. \n503\nThe number of stocks listed on the S&P 500. The total number tends to vary because there may be several companies with multiple share classes. These include Google, Meta Platforms, and Berkshire Hathaway.8\nHow to Invest In the S&P 500 \nYou can’t invest in the S&P 500 directly because it is a stock market index, not an individual stock or fund you can buy. However, you can purchase the stock of S&P Global (SPGI), the company that maintains the index.9 You can also purchase one of every stock listed on the S&P 500, but you'll need quite a bit of capital to do so—it might cost around $3,000 to purchase only one of each of the top 10 stocks on the index. \nFor most people, the simplest and most affordable option for investing in the S&P 500 is to buy shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or index fund that mirrors it. In these instruments, a company builds a portfolio of stocks that mirror the S&P 500 index, securitizes and fractionalizes those stocks, and offers them as shares of a fund you can buy. These funds are often provided at a much lower cost than if you were to buy one of every stock on the index to get similar performance. \nThe first step to investing in the index is to open an account with a reputable brokerage firm such as Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab. Modern brokers have easy-to-use online platforms, where you can buy and sell most types of investments for minimal or no fees.\nThen, look over the brokers' products and find an ETF or index fund that mirrors the S&P 500. Some examples are: \nSPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)\nVanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP)\nSchwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX)\nFidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX)\nWhat Is the Average Rate of Return for the S&P 500 for the Last 20 Years?\nThe average annualized return of the S&P 500 between 2003 and 2023 is 10.20%.10\nWhat Is the Average Rate of Return for the S&P 500 for the Last 10 Years?\nThe average rate of return for the S&P 500 since 2013 is 13.05%.11\nDoes the S&P 500 Return Include Dividends?\nAs calculated, S&P 500 returns do not include dividends. However, you can find results from some analysts that include dividends. The list put together by NYU Stern School of Business finance professor Aswath Damodaran is one example.12\nThe Bottom Line \nThe S&P 500 is the standard for measuring overall market returns. There have been many ups and downs in its century of existence, but generally, the index has produced returns over the long run. Since its inception, it has returned 9.81%. \nYou can invest in the S&P 500 using index funds and exchange-traded funds that mimic the index and not pay as much as you would for each stock. Investing in funds that track the S&P 500 is a long game, not for the faint of heart—many investors have lost everything by panic selling during a dip. If you're looking for an investment with a long-standing history of decent long-term returns, S&P 500 funds might be a suitable choice for your portfolio. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Clientele Effect: Definition, Theory, Examples\nWhat Is the Clientele Effect? \nThe clientele effect explains the movement in a company's stock price according to the demands and goals of its investors. These investor demands come in reaction to a tax, dividend, or other policy change or corporate action which affects a company's shares. \nThe clientele effect assumes that specific investors are preliminarily attracted to different company policies, and that when a company alters one or more such policies they will adjust their stock holdings accordingly. As a result of this adjustment, stock prices can fluctuate. \nKey Takeaways\nThe clientele effect is a common occurrence whereby stock prices are influenced by shareholder demands.\nOne side of the clientele effect describes the way in which individual investors seek out stocks from a specific category.\nA specific instance of this effect is dividend clientele, a term for a group of stockholders who share the same opinion on how a specific company conducts its dividend policy. \nHow the Clientele Effect Works \nThe clientele effect is a change in share price due to corporate decision-making that triggers investors' reactions. A change in policy that is viewed by shareholders as unfavorable may cause them to sell some or all of their holdings, depressing the share price. \nLarge policy shifts can be disruptive for both the company’s long-term interests, as well as shareholders’ portfolios. Once a company establishes a policy pattern and attracts a given clientele, it is generally best not to tinker with it too much. \nThere is a good deal of controversy about whether the clientele effect is a real phenomenon in the markets. Some believe that it takes more factors than just the wishes of a company’s clientele to move a stock’s price greatly. Moreover, even though investors could switch to companies that offered the profile they desired, such changes could entail transaction fees, taxable events, and other costs. \nDividend Clientele \nPublic equities are typically categorized either as dividend-paying securities or not. Each of these categories links to a specific age in the lifecycle of a business as it matures. \nFor example, high-growth stocks traditionally do not pay dividends. However, they are more likely to exhibit substantial price appreciation as the company grows. On the other hand, dividend-paying stocks tend to show smaller movements in capital gains but reward investors with stable, periodic dividends. \nShareholders in a dividend clientele generally base their preferences for a particular dividend payout ratio on comparable income level, personal income tax considerations, or their age. \nThe clientele effect is often connected with dividend rates and payouts by a company.\nSpecial Considerations \nSome investors, like the legendary Warren Buffett, seek investment opportunities in high-dividend stocks. Others, such as technology investors, often seek out high-growth companies with the potential for extravagant capital gains. Thus, the effect first outlines the way in which the company's maturity and business operations initially attract a specific investor type. \nThe second facet of the clientele effect describes how current investors react to substantial changes in a company's policies. For example, if a public technology stock pays no dividends and reinvests all of its profits back into its operations, it initially attracts growth investors. However, if the company stops reinvesting in its growth and instead begins channeling money to dividend payouts, high-growth investors may be inclined to exit their positions and seek other opportunities that better match their needs. Dividend-seeking income investors may now view the company as an attractive investment. \nConsider a company that already pays dividends and has consequently attracted clientele seeking high dividend-paying stocks. If the company should experience a downturn or elects to decrease its dividend offerings, the dividend investors may sell their stock and reinvest the proceeds in another company paying higher returns. As a result of a sell-off, the company's share price is apt to decline. \nExample of the Clientele Effect \nIn 2016, the CEO of Northwestern Mutual publicly announced in a press release a 45-basis-point drop in the dividend scale interest rate. This decision proved to impact the company’s dividend policy negatively. Following the disclosed plans, the company depressed its dividend rate from 5.45% to 5.00%.1 \nMeanwhile, in 2001, Winn-Dixie slashed its dividend and altered its payment structure, opting to distribute income quarterly in arrears instead of monthly in advance. Its shareholders, many of which valued the regular current income, were not happy, and the stock tanked. Some experts see this as the clientele effect in action.23 \nPersonal Advice When You Need it Most\nIf you’re looking for a better way to maximize your retirement income while minimizing your investment taxes, Vanguard Personal Advisor® can help.

  "text": "Market Capitalization: What It Is, Formula for Calculating It\nMarket capitalization, or \"market cap\", is the aggregate market value of a company represented in a dollar amount. Since it represents the “market” value of a company, it is computed based on the current market price (CMP) of its shares and the total number of outstanding shares. \nMarket cap is also used to compare and categorize the size of companies among investors and analysts. \nKey Takeaways\nMarket capitalization is the total dollar value of all outstanding shares of a company at the current market price.\nMarket cap is used to size up corporations and understand their aggregate market value.\nCompanies may be categorized as large-, mid-, or small-cap depending on their market capitalization.\nBlue-chip companies are often large- or mega-cap stocks, while the very smallest are referred to as micro-caps.\nUnderstanding Market Capitalization \nMarket cap is calculated by multiplying a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share. Since a company has a given number of outstanding shares, multiplying X with the per-share price represents the total dollar value of the company. \nOutstanding shares are the total amount of shares currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders. \nFormula and Calculation \nThe formula for market cap is:\nMarket Cap=Price Per Share×Shares Outstanding\\text{Market Cap} = \\text{Price Per Share} \\times \\text{Shares Outstanding}\nFor example, if ABC Corp. trades at $30 per share and had one million outstanding shares, its market capitalization would be ($30 x 1 million shares) = $30 million.\nSince the market price of shares of a publicly listed company keeps changing with each passing second, the market cap also fluctuates accordingly. The number of outstanding shares can also change over time.\nNote that changes to the number of outstanding shares are infrequent, and the figure changes only when the company undertakes certain corporate actions, such as issuing additional shares through a secondary offering, exercising employee stock options (ESO), issuing/redeeming other financial instruments, or buying back its shares under a share repurchase program.\nEssentially, the changes in market cap are largely attributed to the share price changes, though investors should keep an eye on corporate-level developments that may change the number of outstanding shares once in a while. \nTypes of Market Capitalization \nSince capitalization represents a dollar value that can vary widely, different buckets and associated nomenclatures exist for categorizing the different market cap ranges. Below are the commonly used standards for each capitalization. \nMega Cap \nMega-cap companies are those with a market cap of $200 billion or higher. They are the largest publicly traded companies by market value, and typically represent the leaders of a particular industry sector or market. A limited number of companies qualify for this category. \nFor example, as of the market close on June 18, 2024, Nvidia (NVDA) had a market cap of $3.335 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world. It surpassed Microsoft (MSFT), which had a market cap of $3.317 trillion.1 \nLarge Cap \nCompanies that are considered large-cap have a market cap between $10 billion to $200 billion. For example, as of the market close on June 18, 2024, the Walt Disney Company (DIS) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) were large-cap stocks with market caps of $185.04 billion and $156.67 billion, respectively.23 \nBoth mega and large-cap stocks are referred to as blue chips and are considered to be relatively stable and secure. However, there is no guarantee that these companies will maintain their stable valuations as all businesses are subject to market risks. \nMid Cap \nMid-cap stocks range from $2 billion to $10 billion in market cap, and this group of companies is considered to be more volatile than the large-cap and mega-cap companies. Growth stocks represent a significant portion of the mid-caps. \nSome of the companies may or may not be industry leaders, but they may be on their way to becoming one. For example, the social media company Reddit (RDDT) is a mid-cap company, with a market cap of $9.84 billion as of the market close on June 18, 2024.4 \nSmall Cap \nSmall-cap companies have a market cap between $300 million to $2 billion. While the bulk of this category is comprised of relatively young companies that may have promising growth potential, a few established old businesses which may have lost value in recent times for a variety of reasons also figure in the list. \nOne example is JetBlue Airways (JBLU), which had a market cap of $1.93 billion as the market close on June 18, 2024, putting it on the high end of small-cap stocks.5 Track records of such companies aren’t as long as those of the mid-to-mega-caps, but they also present the possibility of greater capital appreciation. \nMicro Cap \nCompanies that are considered micro-cap consist mostly of penny stocks—this category denotes companies with market capitalizations between $50 million to $300 million.6 For instance, a lesser-known pharma company with no marketable product that is working on developing a drug for an incurable disease, or a five-person company working on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotics technology may be listed with a small valuation and limited trading activity. \nWhile the upward potential of such companies is high if they succeed, the downside potential is equally worse if they completely fail. Investments in such companies may not be for the faint-hearted and require more due diligence. \nNano Cap \nNano caps are another high-risk, high-reward layer beyond the micro-caps. Nano-cap companies have market caps below $50 million.6 These companies are considered to be the riskiest, and the potential for gain varies widely. These stocks typically trade on the pink sheets or Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). \nHistorical analysis reveals that mega- and large-caps often experience slower growth with lower risk, while small-caps have higher growth potential but come with higher risk. It is common to see companies making transitions from one category to the other depending upon the change in their market cap valuations regularly. Along with companies, other popular investments like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also categorized as small-cap, mid-cap, or large-cap. In the case of funds, the terms represent the types of stocks in which the fund primarily invests. \nImportance of Market Capitalization \nSome traders and investors, mostly novices, can mistake a stock's price to be an accurate representation of that company’s worth, health, and/or stability. They may perceive a higher stock price as a measure of a company’s stability or a lower price as an investment available at a bargain. Stock price alone does not represent a company's actual worth. Market capitalization is the correct measure to look at, as it represents the true value as perceived by the overall market. \nFor instance, Nvidia closed with a stock price of $135.58 per share on June 18, 2024, when it reached a market cap of $3.335 trillion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) had a much higher stock price of $615,000 per share but a lower market cap of $880.94 billion. Comparing the two companies by solely looking at their stock prices would not give a true representation of their actual relative values. \nWith billions of dollars worth of valuation, a large-cap company may have more room to invest a few hundred millions in a new stream of business and may not take a big hit if the venture fails. However, a mid-cap or micro-cap company making a similar value investment may be susceptible to big blows if their venture fails as they don’t have that bigger cushion to absorb the failure. If the venture succeeds for large-cap companies, it may appear small in their profit numbers. But if the company scales up with its success, it can lead to profits of larger magnitudes. On the other hand, the success of such ventures for a mid-cap company can bolster its valuations to significant heights. \nA high stock price in and of itself does not always indicate a healthy or growing company. It can still have a relatively small market cap!\nSpecial Considerations \nValuations of mid-cap or small-cap companies often take a hit when there are reports of a large-cap company encroaching into their space of products or services. For instance, the entry of Amazon into cloud hosting services under the Amazon Web Services (AWS) umbrella posed a big threat to smaller companies operating in the niche space. \nGenerally, investments in mega-cap or large-cap stocks are considered more conservative with less volatility than investments in small-cap stocks. Though mid and small-cap stocks offer high return potential to risk-taking investors, the relatively limited resources at the disposal of such companies make their stocks more susceptible to competition, uncertainties, and business or economic downturn. \nThe different measurement of Market Cap values also form the basis to launch a variety of market indexes. For example, the benchmark equity index, the S&P 500, includes the top 500 U.S. companies which are weighted based on their market cap value, while the FTSE 100 index includes the top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalization. Both indexes use the Float-Adjusted Market Cap Calculation. \nSuch indexes not only represent the overall market developments and sentiments, but are also used as benchmarks to track the performance of various funds, portfolios, and individual investments. \nWhy Are Small-Cap Stocks Often More Volatile?\nSmall-cap stocks have relatively lower market values because these tend to be younger growth companies. Because of their growth orientation, they may be riskier since they spend their revenues on growth and expansion. Small-cap stocks are therefore often more volatile than those of larger companies. Generally, large-cap stocks experience slower growth and are more likely to pay dividends than faster-growing, small- or mid-cap stocks.\nWhat Is a Market Capitalization-Weighted Index?\nMany stock indexes, such as the S&P 500, are weighted by market cap. This means that stocks with larger market capitalizations make up comparatively more of the index.\nHow Do Stock Splits Affect Market Cap?\nWhen a company undergoes a stock split, it increases the number of shares outstanding while reducing the price of each share by a similar proportion. For instance, in a 2:1 stock split, there will be twice as many shares, but at half the pre-split price. As a result, splits do not inherently influence market cap.\nThe Bottom Line \nAn understanding of the market cap concept is important for not only the individual stock investor but also investors of various funds. Market caps can help investors know where they are putting their hard-earned money.",

  "text": "What Is a Depositary Receipt (DR)? Definition, Types and Examples\nWhat Is a Depositary Receipt (DR)? \nA depositary receipt (DR) is a negotiable certificate issued by a bank. It represents shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange and gives investors the opportunity to hold shares in the equity of foreign countries. It gives them an alternative to trading on an international market. \nA depositary receipt was originally a physical certificate that allowed investors to hold shares in the equity of other countries. One of the most common types of DRs is the American depositary receipt (ADR), which has been offering companies, investors, and traders global investment opportunities since the 1920s.1 \nKey Takeaways\nA depositary receipt (DR) is a negotiable certificate representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange.\nDepositary receipts allow investors to hold equity shares of foreign companies without the need to trade directly on a foreign market.\nDepositary receipts allow investors to diversify their portfolios by purchasing shares of companies in different markets and economies. \nDepositary receipts are more convenient and less expensive than purchasing stocks directly in foreign markets.\nUnderstanding Depositary Receipts (DR) \nA depositary receipt allows investors to hold shares in stocks of companies that are listed on exchanges in foreign countries. A depositary receipt avoids the need to trade directly with the stock exchange in the foreign market. Investors instead transact with a major financial institution within their home country. This typically reduces fees and is far more convenient than purchasing stocks directly in foreign markets.2 \nAmerican Depositary Receipts \nInvestors can gain access to foreign stocks via American depositary receipts (ADRs) in the United States. ADRs are issued only by U.S. banks for foreign stocks that are traded on a U.S. exchange, including the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), NYSE, or Nasdaq. The receipt is listed in U.S. dollars when an investor purchases an American depositary receipt. A U.S. financial institution overseas rather than a global institution holds the actual underlying security.3 \nADRs are a great way to buy shares in a foreign company while earning capital gains and possibly being paid dividends, which are cash payments by the companies to shareholders. Both capital gains and dividends are paid in U.S. dollars. \nADR holders don't have to transact in foreign currencies because ADRs trade in U.S. dollars and clear through U.S. settlement systems. The U.S. banks require that the foreign companies provide them with detailed financial information, making it easier for investors to assess the company's financial health compared to a foreign company that only transacts on international exchanges. \nAn Example of an ADR \nICICI Bank Ltd. is listed in India and is typically unavailable to foreign investors. But ICICI Bank has an American depositary receipt issued by Deutsche Bank that trades on the NYSE, which most U.S. investors can access.4 This provides it with much wider availability among investors. \nGain more insight about depositary receipts from our in-depth tutorial on ADR Basics.\nGlobal Depositary Receipts \nDepositary receipts have spread to other parts of the globe in the form of global depositary receipts (GDRs), European DRs, and international DRs. ADRs are traded on a U.S. national stock exchange, but GDRs are commonly listed on European stock exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange. Both ADRs and GDRs are usually denominated in U.S. dollars, but they can also be denominated in euros. \nA GDR works similarly to an ADR but in reverse. A U.S.-based company that wants its stock to be listed on the London Stock Exchange can accomplish this via a GDR. The U.S.-based company enters into a depositary receipt agreement with the London depository bank. In turn, the London bank issues shares in Britain based on the regulatory compliance for both countries.5 \nAdvantages of Depositary Receipts \nDepositary receipts can be attractive to investors because they allow them to diversify their portfolios and purchase shares in foreign companies. Diversification is an investment strategy in which a portfolio is constructed so it contains a wide variety of stocks in multiple industries. Diversifying using depository receipts along with other investments prevents a portfolio from being too heavily concentrated in one holding or sector. \nDepositary receipts provide investors with the benefits and rights of the underlying shares, which can include voting rights and dividends. They can open up markets that investors wouldn't have access to otherwise. \nDepositary receipts are more convenient and less expensive than purchasing stocks in foreign markets. ADRs help reduce the administration and duty costs that would otherwise be levied on each transaction. \nDepositary receipts help international companies raise capital globally and encourage international investment.\nDisadvantages of Depositary Receipts \nOne of the disadvantages of depository receipts is that investors may find that many aren't listed on a stock exchange. They may only have institutional investors trading them. \nAnother potential downside to depositary receipts is their relatively low liquidity. There aren't many buyers and sellers, and this can lead to delays in entering and exiting a position. They may also come with significant administrative fees in some cases. \nDepositary receipts such as ADRs don't eliminate currency risk for the underlying shares in another country. Dividend payments in euros are converted to U.S. dollars, net of conversion expenses and foreign taxes. The conversion is done in accordance with the deposit agreement. Fluctuations in the exchange rate could impact the value of the dividend payment. \nInvestors still face economic risks because the country in which the foreign company is located could experience a recession, bank failures, or political upheaval. The value of depository receipt would fluctuate as a result, along with any heightened risks in the foreign county.6 \nThere are also risks with attending securities that aren't backed by a company. The depositary receipt may be withdrawn at any time, and the waiting period for the shares being sold and the proceeds distributed to investors can be long. \nFrequently Asked Questions \nHow is a depositary receipt transaction accomplished?\nA foreign-listed company typically hires a financial advisor to help it navigate regulations when it wants to create a depositary receipt abroad. The company also generally uses a domestic bank to act as the custodian and a broker in the target country. The domestic bank will list shares of the firm on an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), in the country where the firm is located.3\nHow are depositary receipts taxed?\nDividends and gains earned on American depositary receipts are paid in U.S. dollars, net of expenses and foreign taxes. Most banks withhold to cover foreign taxes, but the full income is still reportable and potentially taxable on your U.S. tax return, potentially resulting in double taxation unless steps are taken to prevent this.7\nWhat is a \"sponsored\" ADR?\nA depositary bank works with a foreign company and its custodian bank with a sponsored American depositary receipt. ADRs are otherwise issued by brokers or dealers that own common stock in the foreign company. Unsponsored ADRs aren't commonly available on exchanges.3\nThe Bottom Line \nYou can avoid trading directly with foreign stock exchanges by purchasing depositary receipts, but DRs come with both pros and cons. They're convenient, and they can be less expensive than trading directly because the fees are often reduced. But your investment can be impacted by economic risks and circumstances in the foreign country, and DRs aren't particularly liquid. Trades you make can be subject to some delays, so you'll want to be sure that you can weather these circumstances. \nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research.

  "text": "Political Risk\nWhat is Political Risk \nPolitical risk is the risk an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting investment returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers or military control. Political risk is also known as \"geopolitical risk,\" and becomes more of a factor as the time horizon of investment gets longer. They are considered a type of jurisdiction risk. \nBREAKING DOWN Political Risk \nPolitical risks are notoriously hard to quantify because there are limited sample sizes or case studies when discussing an individual nation. Some political risks can be insured against through international agencies or other government bodies. The outcome of political risk could drag down investment returns or even go so far as to remove the ability to withdraw capital from an investment. \nTypes of Political Risks \nAside from business factors arising from the marketplace, businesses are also impacted by political decisions. There are a variety of decisions governments make that can affect individual businesses, industries, and the overall economy. These include taxes, spending, regulation, currency valuation, trade tariffs, labor laws such as the minimum wage, and environmental regulations. The laws, even if just proposed, can have an impact. Regulations can be set at all levels of government, including federal, state and local, as well as in other countries. \nSome of the political risks may be found in a company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or a prospectus if it is a mutual fund. \nInsuring Against Political Risks \nCompanies that operate internationally, known as multinational businesses, can purchase political risk insurance to remove or mitigate certain political risks. This allows management and investors to concentrate on the business fundamentals while knowing losses from political risks are avoided or limited. Typical actions covered include war and terrorism. \nAn Example \nWal-Mart Stores Inc. outlined certain political risks it faces in its fiscal 2015 10-K filing with the SEC under its operating risk section. In its risks associated with suppliers, Wal-Mart mentioned potential political and economic instability in the countries that foreign suppliers operate, labor problems, and foreign trade policies and tariffs that could be imposed. \nIn its regulatory, compliance, reputational and other risks section, the company outlines risk associated with legislative, judicial, regulatory and political/economic risks. Risk factors mentioned include political instability, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, trade policies, and currency regulations. Wal-Mart mentioned Brazil specifically, and the complexity of its federal, state and local laws. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "What's the Most Expensive Stock of All Time?\nStock price is an indicator of a company's market value, but the price of a share of stock will also depend on the number of shares outstanding. The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split. \nThere are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here, we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad. \nKey Takeaways\nCompanies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange, or number of shares outstanding times the share price.\nStill, many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange, which can indicate exclusivity.\nCompanies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.\nTop Companies by Stock Price \nThe most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), which was trading at $458,675 per share, as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18, 2022, at $487,255.1 Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder, this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price. \nImage by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020 \nThe next company behind Berkshire, in terms of nominal share price, is NVR (NVR) at $5,154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB), which was trading at $3,731.02, and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2,852.86, followed by Alphabet, Inc (GOOG) at $2,607.03 a share.2 \nTop Companies by Market Cap \nBy market capitalization, as of January 2022, Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion, Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion, Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion, Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion, and Meta (META), formerly Facebook, at $843.34 billion.2 \nBack in 2007, Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However, this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022, PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.3 \nTop Companies by Revenue \nIn terms of the biggest global companies by revenue, Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523,964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383,906 billion in revenues, followed by Amazon with $280,522 billion, and China National Petroleum at $379,130 billion.4 \nSinopec Group ranks fifth with $407,009 billion in annual revenues, and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260,174 billion and $256,776 billion in yearly revenues, respectively.4 \nBased on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance, Walmart still has the top spot, while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth, seventh, and eighth spots: CVS, UnitedHealth Group, and McKesson, generating $256.78 billion, $242.15 billion, and $231.05 billion, respectively.5 \nBerkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues, and the ninth and tenth spots are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues, respectively.5 \nBased on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2019 performance, Walmart still has the top spot, while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group, McKesson, and CVS, generating $226.25 billion, $214.32 billion, and $194.58 billion, respectively.5 \nTop Private Companies \nIn terms of private companies, Forbes ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155,000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122,000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain Publix Super Markets, with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227,000 employees.6 \nThe fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B, which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion, respectively. Each employs over 100,000 employees.6 \nThe Bottom Line \nOn a pure market value measure, Apple has often been considered the most valuable, publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures, and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share. \nEarn Up to 4.90% APY on Your USD Savings\nEarn interest on your USD while keeping funds open for trading.

  "text": "Dual Class Stock: Definition, Structure, and Controversy\nWhat Is a Dual Class Stock? \nA dual class stock is when a company issues two share classes. A dual class stock structure can consist of Class A and Class B shares, for example. These shares can differ in terms of voting rights and dividend payments. \nWhen multiple share classes of stock are issued, typically one class is offered to the general public, while the other is offered to company founders, executives, and family. The class offered to the general public often has limited or no voting rights, while the class available to founders and executives has more voting power and often provides for majority control of the company. \nKey Takeaways\nA company or stock with a dual-class structure has two or more classes of shares with different voting rights.\nTypically insiders are given access to a class of shares that provide greater control and voting rights, while the general public is offered a class of shares with little or no voting rights.\nSupporters say these types of structures allow the people who founded and currently run the company to think long-term, rather than be at the mercy of shorter-term-oriented investors who want to see bigger profits right away.\nDual-class structures are controversial because they do not allow public shareholders a say in running the company and distribute risk unequally.\nUnderstanding a Dual Class Stock \nDual class stock is designed to give specific shareholders voting control. Classes of stock with unequal voting shares may be created to satisfy owners who don't want to give up control, but do want the public equity market to provide financing. \nIn most cases, these so-called super-voting shares are not publicly traded and company founders and their families are most commonly the controlling groups in dual-class companies. Although there is no standard nomenclature for multiple share classes, Class A shares are normally superior to Class B shares. In other cases, though, the reverse is true. That's why investors should research the details of a company's share classes if they are considering investing in a firm with more than one class of shares. \nWell-known companies, such as Ford and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, have dual class stock structures, which provide founders, executives, and families the ability to control majority voting power with a relatively small percentage of total equity. \nThe dual-class structure at Ford, for instance, gives the Ford family control of 40% of the voting power, while owning a small percentage of the company's total equity.1 An extreme example is Echostar Communications CEO Charlie Ergen, who controls around 91.8% of the vote with his powerful Class A shares.2 \nDual-class structures allow companies to access public capital without sacrificing control.\nSpecial Considerations \nWhile they've recently become popular, dual-class structures have been around for some time in various forms. \nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) banned dual-class structures in 1940 after an outcry in 1926 over automotive company Dodge Brothers' public offering, which consisted of non-voting shares for the public. However, the exchange reinstated the practice during the 1980s in the wake of competition from other exchanges.3 Once shares are listed, companies cannot reverse any voting rights attributed to the new class, or issue any classes of shares with superior voting rights. \n7%\nThe approximate percentage of U.S. companies in the Russell 3000 Index with a dual- or multiple-class structure, according to a Harvard Law School study.4\nIn recent times, the number of companies opting for a dual-class structure during listing has multiplied. This is particularly the case among technology startups, many of which use this strategy to retain control over their outfits. Alphabet Inc.'s Google is the most famous example of this trend (see below). \nAlphabet Inc.'s Google is the most famous example of this trend. Many investors were frustrated at Google’s initial public offering (IPO) when the internet giant, boasting a market capitalization among the top 30 firms worldwide, issued second Class B shares to founders with 10 times the amount of votes as the ordinary Class A shares sold to the public.5 \nSeveral stock indexes have stopped including companies with dual-class structures. The S&P 500 and FTSE Russell are two such indexes.67 \nDual Class Stock Controversy \nDual class stock structures are controversial. Their supporters argue that the structure enables founders to demonstrate strong leadership and the placing of long-term interests over near-term financial results. It also helps founders retain control over the company as potential takeovers can be avoided through their supermajority voting shares. \nOn the other hand, opponents argue that the structure allows a small group of privileged shareholders to maintain control, while other shareholders (with less voting power) provide the majority of the capital. In effect, there is an unequal distribution of risk. \nThe founder is able to access capital from public markets at minimal economic risk. Shareholders carry a major part of the risk related to strategy. \nAcademic research has proved that powerful classes of shares for insiders can actually hinder long-term outperformance. A middle path has been suggested by another group of shareholders. According to them, the effects of a dual-class structure can be limited by placing a time-bound restriction on such structures and allowing shareholders to accumulate voting interest over time. \nExamples of Dual-Class Structures \nAlphabet subsidiary Google is the most famous example of a company with a dual-class structure. When it was listed in 2004, the search giant unveiled two classes of shares in its offering. Class A shares were reserved for regular investors and had one vote per share. Class B shares were reserved for founders and executives and had 10 times as many votes as those for the \"ordinary\" A shares.5 \nMany investors were frustrated at this initial public offering (IPO), given that the internet giant boasted a market capitalization among the top 30 firms worldwide.5 Later, the company added a third class of shares. These Class C shares came with zero voting rights. \nOther examples of companies with dual-class structures are Meta (formerly Facebook), Zynga, Groupon, and Alibaba. \nBuy Bitcoin and over 260 crypto on Uphold.\nTrading crypto can involve hours of research.

We also offer a teen checking account featuring a fee-free debit card and easy-to-use mobile app, as well as a kids-friendly savings account that helps earn interest while growing their money.\nWhat type of account should I get if I'm looking for interest?\nTypically, certificates of deposit (CDs) and savings accounts are where you earn interest on your money. Some banks have checking accounts that earn interest—most don't. However, you can earn interest with every online Capital One bank account—checking, savings and CDs.\nHow much of my money is safe in a bank?\nNearly all banks carry FDIC insurance to protect the bank accounts of their customers. In the event of bank failure, this insurance covers what are known as depository accounts—such as checking, savings and certificates of deposits (CDs)—up to the allowable limits. For more information, visit fdic.gov.",

Capital One Kids Savings Accounts let you send their allowance on a schedule, link your bank account for easy transfers and create multiple accounts for each of your child’s financial goals.\nWhat do you need to open a kids or teen bank account?\nDepending on where you bank, requirements might be different. At Capital One, you’ll need to provide details like: address, date of birth and Social Security number. For more info, check out the FAQs on Kids Savings or MONEY Teen Checking.\nWhat are the age requirements for a kids savings account?\nDifferent banks may have different requirements. At Capital One, it’s never too early to open a Kids Savings Account for your child. Start saving when they’re a baby and watch their money grow as they do. A Kids Savings Account is owned by one child under 18 years old and one adult. If the child is under the age of 12, the adult must be the child’s parent or legal guardian.\nWhen should I open a savings account for my kid?\nThere’s no right or wrong time to start. Giving them a basic understanding of money and the importance of saving can help set them up for a strong financial future.",

  "text": "A secured credit card requires the applicant to make a security deposit to open their account. This deposit serves to protect the card issuer and, in many cases, the amount you deposit becomes your credit limit.\nSecured credit cards tend to be a good option for those looking to build or rebuild their credit. And with consistent, responsible use, you can improve your credit scores, earn back your security deposit* and become eligible for an unsecured credit card.\nUnsecured credit cards are likely what you think of as a “typical\" credit card—a revolving line of credit that does not require a security deposit.\n*With a secured credit card from Capital One, your security deposit will be returned and your account unsecured. All other card terms and features will remain the same.",

If your Account charges off, the entire balance is due immediately.\nMastercard is a registered trademark, and the circles design is a trademark of Mastercard International Incorporated.\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS REWARDS PROGRAM\nHow do I earn rewards?\nYou will earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel using this Rewards card account, and 1.5% cash back on all other purchases. Earnings will apply to net purchases (purchases minus any credits or returns) only. Cash advances, balance transfers, and checks used to access your account are not considered purchases and will not earn rewards. All purchases made outside of Capital One Travel such as hotel incidentals, upgrades or other expenses, will not earn the enhanced earn rate, but will receive the standard 1.5% cash back earn rate.\nHow does my spend bonus work?\nYou will earn a $200 bonus if you spend at least $500 within 3 months of your rewards membership enrollment date. Once you qualify for this bonus, we will apply it to your rewards balance within two billing cycles. Existing or previous cardmembers are not eligible for this product if they have received a new cardmember bonus for this product in the past 48 months.\nHow do I earn my rewards on purchases made on Capital One Entertainment?\nThrough 12/31/25, you will earn 5% cash back on Capital One Entertainment purchases. Rewards earned will post to your account within 1-2 billing cycles. Qualifying purchases include tickets purchased on the Capital One Entertainment ticketing platform only, paid for with an eligible Capital One rewards card. Tickets purchased through the Capital One cardholder exclusive pre-sales page (www.capitalone.com/pre-sales); tickets purchased directly through the Capital One Hall or Capital One Arena ticketing services; and dining reservations or purchases through Capital One Dining are excluded. Rewards earned will be reclaimed if you cancel or return an eligible purchase.\nWill my rewards ever expire? \nYour rewards are yours for the life of the account—they will not expire. But if your account is closed, you may lose any rewards you have not redeemed.\nIs there a limit to the amount of rewards I can earn? \nThere is no cap to the amount of rewards you can earn on purchases.\nHow do I redeem my rewards?\nYou can get your cash back upon request in the form of a statement credit or a check. You can also set up an automatic redemption preference; options include: (1) at a set time each calendar year or (2) when a specific threshold has been reached. Just go online to capitalone.com. You can also redeem for credits for previous purchases, gift cards, and more. Rates for these redemption options may vary and can change in the sole discretion of Capital One. Accounts that are not in good standing (e.g., suspended, restricted, delinquent, or otherwise in default) or closed may have different redemption options or may lose any unredeemed rewards.\nWhat happens if I do not set up an automatic redemption preference?\nUntil you set up an automatic redemption preference, you will receive your cash back upon your request.\nHow often can I change my automatic redemption preference?\nYou may change your automatic redemption preference at any time, but you cannot request an annual redemption to be fulfilled in the same month you make a change. If you have an automatic redemption preference, you may also make upon-request redemptions without interfering with your pre-established automatic redemption preference.\nHow do I redeem my rewards for new travel reservations?\nGo online to travel.capitalone.com to book your flight, car rental or hotel and use your cash back rewards to pay for your travel. If your travel transaction includes taxes, surcharges, and fees, these expenses will be included in the overall calculation to determine how much cash back rewards are required for redemption. Separately itemized travel transactions on your statement cannot be combined for a single redemption. Please note that Capital One has no control over how merchants itemize and charge related transactions.\nIs my account eligible to transfer rewards?\nYour account may be eligible to transfer rewards. Please be aware that transfers are only permitted between certain Capital One rewards accounts. Not all rewards products are eligible for transfer.\nADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES & TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nI understand that I am not eligible for this offer if:\nMy application is received after this offer expires, is incomplete, unreadable, inaccurate or cannot be verified.\nMy address is not in one of the following locations: the 50 United States, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico or a U.S. military location.\nMy address is a correctional institution.\nMy monthly income (my disclosed total annual income divided by 12) doesn't exceed my monthly rent/mortgage payment by at least $425. Or, Capital One otherwise determines that I am unable to make my monthly payments.\nI am under 18 or do not have a valid Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\nI have applied for a Capital One credit card 2 or more times in the last 30 days.\nI have received a new cardmember bonus for this product in the past 48 months.\nI have a past due Capital One credit card account.\nI am over my credit line on a Capital One credit card.\nI have had a Capital One credit card that charged off within the past year.\nI have a non-discharged bankruptcy (one that is still unresolved).\nI have implemented a credit security freeze or credit lock with one or more of the credit bureaus, which prevents Capital One from accessing my credit report.\nWith respect to this account, I understand that:\nI am not obligated to accept the card or pay any fee or charge unless I use this card.\nEven if I am otherwise eligible for this offer, approval is based upon satisfying Capital One's credit standards.\nCapital One may contact me to obtain or confirm application information.\nI am providing my application information to Capital One, N.A. and its affiliates.\nI am authorizing Capital One to check my consumer report information and my Demand Deposit Account data, such as checking account information, and to verify my employment, income, and/or other application information with third parties.\nI am authorizing Capital One to use consumer report information that it collects for analysis and to otherwise improve the products and services it offers.\nI am authorizing Capital One to verify education-related information in my application and am authorizing my school to release enrollment information for that purpose.\nIf I am approved, I am requesting that Capital One send me a physical credit card in the mail and make a virtual card number available to me when I log into the Capital One mobile app or website.\nI may not be eligible to access a virtual card. If I am eligible, I understand I must verify my identity before accessing my virtual card. In some cases, I will not be able to access my virtual card until approximately 30 days after account opening, and I may not have access to my full credit line until my physical card is activated. Web access is needed to manage my virtual card number online or in the Mobile app. Virtual cards may not be accepted by all stores. Virtual cards are not available for debit cards and some credit cards.\nIf I am approved, Capital One may contact me regarding my Card and Account as described in my Capital One Customer Agreement. For example, when I give Capital One my mobile telephone number, I agree to receive messages from Capital One and their authorized agents, including prerecorded and text messages. I also consent to receive calls through an automatic telephone dialer (autodialer).\nI will receive the Capital One Customer Agreement. I am bound by its terms and all future revisions.\nThis offer is nontransferable.\nI understand that, unless the offer discloses a specific credit line, the exact amount of my credit line will be determined by Capital One after review of my application and other information.\nAn applicant, if married, may apply for a separate account.\nEverything I have stated in this application is correct.\nThis card is intended primarily for consumer use.\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS CARD\nWhen Can I Request A Transfer?\nYou may request a transfer 10 days after your account is opened. Your account may not always be eligible for Transfers. Transfer eligibility is determined by Capital One at our discretion. Transfers between Capital One accounts are not permitted. That means balances cannot be transferred to this account from any other credit card issued by Capital One.\nHow Do You Apply My Payment?\nWe will apply payments up to your minimum payment first to the balance with the lowest APR (including 0% APR), and then to balances with higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment exceeding your minimum payment to the balance with the highest APR, and then to balances with lower APRs.\nHow Can I Avoid Paying Interest Charges?\nIf you pay your statement’s “New Balance” in full by the due date each month, we will not charge interest on any new transactions that post to the purchase balance. If you have been paying your account in full without interest charges, but fail to pay your next “New Balance” in full, we will charge interest on the unpaid balance. For cash advances and transfers, we will start charging interest on the transaction date. From time to time, we may give you offers that allow you to pay less than the total balance and avoid interest charges to new transactions that post to your purchase balance. If we do, we will provide details in the specific offer.\nHow Is The Interest Charge Determined?\nInterest charges accrue from the 1) date of the transaction, 2) date the transaction is processed or 3) first day of the billing period. Interest accrues daily on every unpaid amount until it is paid in full. Any interest that has accrued during a billing period will post to your Account at the end of the billing period and will appear on your next Statement. This means you may owe Interest Charges even if you pay the entire “New Balance” one month, but did not do so the previous month. For example, even if a customer pays their balance in full on a February 26th due date, interest would continue to accrue on the balance from February 2nd (the start of the Billing Cycle) through February 26th, and will appear on their next Statement. Once you start accruing Interest Charges, you generally must pay your New Balance in full for two consecutive Billing Cycles before Interest Charges stop being posted to your Statement. Interest Charges are added to the proper segment of your account. However, we reserve the right to not assess Interest Charges.\nHow Do You Calculate The Interest Charge?\nWe use a method called Average Daily Balance (including new transactions). Under this method, we first calculate your daily balance; for each segment, 1) take the beginning balance and add in new transactions and the periodic interest charge on the previous day’s balance, then 2) subtract any payments and credits for that segment as of that day. The result is the daily balance for each segment. However, if you paid your previous month’s balance in full (or if your balance was zero or a credit amount), new transactions which post to your purchase or special purchase segments are not added to the daily balances. Also, transactions subject to a grace period are not added to the daily balances. \nNext, to find your Average Daily Balance: 1) add the daily balances together for each segment, and 2) divide the sum by the number of days in the billing cycle. \nAt the end of each billing cycle, we determine your Interest Charge as follows: 1) multiply your Average Daily Balance by the daily periodic rate (APR divided by 365) for that segment, and 2) multiply the result by the number of days in the billing period. NOTE: Due to rounding or a minimum interest charge, this calculation may vary from the interest charge actually assessed.\nAre Unauthorized Use Or $0 Fraud Liability Claims Subject To Investigation And Verification?\nYes.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT:\nTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.\nMILITARY LENDING ACT NOTICE\nFederal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: The costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account).\nTo hear this same disclosure and a general description of your payment obligations for this credit card account, please call us toll-free at: 844-788-8999.\nDuring any period in which the Military Lending Act (“the Act”) applies to you, no provision of your Cardholder Agreement that is inconsistent with the Act shall apply and your Cardholder Agreement shall be interpreted to comply with the Act. \nREGIONAL DISCLOSURE INFORMATION\nOhio Residents: Ohio anti-discrimination laws require creditors to make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on individuals upon request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers these laws.\nNew York and Vermont Residents: Capital One may obtain your credit reports, for any legitimate purpose associated with the account or the application or request for an account, including but not limited to reviewing, modifying, renewing and collecting on your account. On your request, you will be informed if such a report was ordered. If so, you will be given the name and address of the consumer reporting agency furnishing the report. New York residents may contact the New York State Department of Financial Services by telephone or visit its website for free information on comparative credit card rates, fees and grace periods. New York State Department of Financial Services: 1-877-226-5697 or http://www.dfs.ny.gov. \nWisconsin Residents: No provision of any marital property agreement, unilateral statement, or court order applying to marital property will adversely affect a creditor’s interests unless, prior to the time credit is granted, the creditor is furnished with a copy of the agreement, statement or court order, or has actual knowledge of the provision. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.\nPuerto Rico Residents: Puerto Rico Residents may request a copy of these disclosures in Spanish.\nResidentes de Puerto Rico: Pueden solicitar una copia de este documento en Español.\nYOUR BILLING RIGHTS: KEEP THIS DOCUMENT FOR FUTURE USE\nThis notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.\nWhat To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement:\nIf you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:\nCapital One, P. O. Box 30279, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0279\nIn your letter, give us the following information:\nAccount information: Your name and account number.\nDollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.\nDescription of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.\nYou must contact us:\nWithin 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.\nAt least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.\nYou must notify us of any potential errors \nin writing\n. You may call us or notify us electronically, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.\nWhat Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter.\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: \nWithin 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.\nWithin 90 days of our receipt of your letter, we will send you a written notice explaining either that we corrected the error (to appear on your next statement) or the reasons we believe the bill is correct.\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following are true:\nWe cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.\nThe charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.\nWhile you do not have to pay the amount in question until we send you a notice about the outcome of our investigation, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.\nWe can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:\nIf we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.\nIf we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.\nIf you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us at Capital One, P.O. Box 30279, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0279 within \n10 days\ntelling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.\nIf we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.\nYour Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:\nYou must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify; and\nYou must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us \nin writing\nat:\nCapital One, P. O. Box 30279, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0279\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision.

CD rates are fixed upon opening the account. Early withdrawal penalties apply. The above terms are offered at this time and are subject to change. Some of the outlined CD terms may be available for a limited time.\nCalculations are based on interest that is accrued daily but paid and compounded monthly through the CD term. Calculations assume 30 days per month and that monthly interest is reinvested in the CD. Results in the above table are rounded to the nearest dollar.

Capital One CD terms range from 6 months to 60 months. In exchange for leaving your money in the account for the term, you earn interest on the money you deposit. Keep in mind, you can’t access your money until your CD term ends without incurring a penalty.\nSince CD account rates are often higher than traditional savings accounts, CDs are a great way to reach your savings goals faster using money that you don't need immediately.\nHow much interest will I earn on a CD?\nHow much interest you earn on your 360 CD account will depend on how much you deposit, your specific term and interest rate. Check out current Capital One 360 CD rates and terms on this page to see how much you can earn. You can enter a deposit amount to instantly see how much you will earn at the end of each term.",

  "text": "How do student credit cards work?\nCapital One student credit cards offer students the chance to build credit by using their card responsibly to make purchases, making timely payments on their balances and maintaining a healthy credit utilization ratio. Capital One student cards also come with student-friendly perks, like cash back.\nWondering what happens to your account after graduation? No need to get a new card—you can still enjoy all the rewards and benefits your Capital One student credit card has to offer.\nBefore applying for a credit card, consider getting pre-approved to see which cards you qualify for. It’s quick, easy, and won’t hurt your credit score. And remember: You don’t need a credit score to apply, though we may use credit scores where available.\nAre student credit cards only for college students?\nYou must be at least 18 years of age and a student to qualify for student credit cards. \nYou may be eligible for a Capital One student card if you’re enrolled—or admitted and planning to enroll in the next three months—at an accredited university, community college or other higher education institution.\nWant to find the best student credit card for you? Getting pre-approved could help you find the right card before you apply.\nWhich student credit card is right for me?\nChoosing the best student credit card for you depends on what you want out of a card. Capital One student credit cards are designed for applicants with little or no credit history—plus they offer no annual fee, hidden fees, or foreign transaction fees. These student credit cards also offer bonuses and let you earn rewards on everyday purchases: \nSavor Rewards for Students features student-friendly perks, like unlimited 3% cash back on dining and at grocery stores—excluding superstores like Walmart® and Target®—and entertainment, including popular streaming services, plus 1% cash back on all other purchases.\nQuicksilver Rewards for Students allows qualifying students to earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases and a one-time $50 cash bonus after spending $100 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening.\nConsider getting pre-approved to see which cards you qualify for.\nHow do I know if I’ll be approved for a student credit card?\nSeveral factors—like an applicant’s credit score, payment history, and income—may influence whether or not someone will be approved for a credit card. \nBut if you’re just starting your financial journey, don’t worry. Capital One student cards are designed for students with little or no credit history.\nGetting pre-approved could help you see which cards you may qualify for before you apply. And if you’re not a student but want to build credit, check out these other alternatives. \nWill getting pre-approved hurt my credit score?\nNo, checking to see if you’re pre-approved for a Capital One credit card won’t cause any damage to your credit score. That’s because our pre-approval tool won’t result in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which can temporarily lower your credit score.\nOur pre-approval tool will show you the student credit cards you’re more likely to qualify for, too. That way, you can apply with more confidence.\nWhat can I do to help improve my credit score?\nThere are a few steps you can take to use your card responsibly and help build a better credit score over time: \n1. Use CreditWise by Capital One to monitor your credit score and TransUnion credit report.\n2. Make timely payments on your bills each month.\n3. Stay below your credit limit—and keep an eye on your credit utilization.\n4. Limit new credit applications to prevent hard inquiries on your credit report.\nAnd after implementing these tactics to raise your score, you may consider getting pre-approved for a Capital One credit card to find one that works best for you and your lifestyle.",

  "text": "Accessibility Tips\nHow to zoom in your screen\nSome people like to zoom into the screen or web browser in order to see things better. Here are a few ways of doing it depending on your setup:\nOn Windows, press the Windows key and plus sign (+) at the same time to zoom in. You can also use the \"Magnifier\" application under \"Accessories\".\nOn Mac, go to \"System Preferences\", open \"Universal Access\" and select the \"Seeing\" tab. Check the box under \"Zoom\" to \"On\".\nOn your Apple device, tap \"Settings\", then \"General\", then \"Accessibility\". Tap the \"Zoom\" button and toggle it \"On\".\nAnother trick is to use \"Ctrl\" (\"Cmd\" on Mac) plus the plus (+) or minus (-) keys when you're in a web browser.\nHow to change the colors or fonts on the page\nSome people like to change colors or fonts to see words more clearly. Most major web browsers have options to do this:\nIn Internet Explorer, go to \"Tools\", then \"Internet Options\", on to \"General\". From here, select \"Colors, Fonts, or Accessibility\".\nIn Mozilla Firefox, choose \"Options\", then \"Content\", then finally \"Fonts & Colors\".\nIn Safari, select \"Preferences\", \"Appearance\" tab, and then hit the \"Select…\" button next to the font fields.\nIn Chrome, go to \"Preferences\", activate the \"Show advanced settings\" link, go to the \"Web content\" heading and change the \"Font size\", \"Customize fonts\" in other ways, or set default \"Page zoom\".\nWe recommend a mixture of settings like enlarging font size and zooming into the browser for a better experience.\nHow to find and use a screen reader\nScreen readers are text-to-speech software that allow people to read and interact with content in different ways. Many people who cannot perceive what is on the screen will use them to allow audible access to web content. Capital One designs and codes for accessibility. We strive to ensure that our content is accessible to screen readers.\nThere are free options available including NVDA for Windows and VoiceOver for Mac. What we recommend is JAWS for Windows. You can use this with your favorite web browser.\nScreen readers accept input in a variety of ways, but one of the most common forms is through your keyboard. By pressing the down arrow in JAWS, for example, you are able navigate through items on the page. JAWS will also accept Braille input.\nThere are a lot of great features right on your smart phone. iOS and Android alike provide many tools to help you access what you love. Let’s have a look at a few of those tools.\nVoiceOver for iOS and TalkBack for Android are the screen readers that come built-in. To turn on VoiceOver, go to \"Settings\", then \"General\", to \"Accessibility\", and then turn \"VoiceOver\" on. You can set the “Accessibility Shortcut” to “VoiceOver” from the \"Accessibility\" page in order to triple-click the \"Home\" button to toggle VoiceOver on and off. TalkBack has a similar feature.\n\"Zoom\", \"Magnifier\", \"Invert Colors\", \"Color Filters\", and \"Reduce White Point\" are other features and tools on iOS that you can use. These are also available through the “Accessibility Shortcut”.",

The email is designed to trick users into providing personal information like credit card information, Social Security numbers, and login credentials. \nHow to Identify Phishing\nHere are some ways to spot potential phishing emails:\nCheck the Details. Inspect the sender’s email address and hover over (do not click) any URL links included in the message. Although the email address and URL may appear to be legitimate at first glance, this information can be spoofed or direct you to an unauthorized site.\nBeware the Scare. Scare tactics are often used to prompt victims to quickly respond to requests for personal or financial information. Email notices that threaten to close your account or impose fines or penalties should be treated as suspect.\nLook Out for Errors. Spelling, grammatical errors, and oddly structured sentences can indicate that the email is not from a legitimate source. Furthermore, emails that use generic titles (like Mr., Mrs., Sir or Madam, etc.) instead of your legal name should be treated with caution.\nGo to the Source. Phishing emails may use official logos and headers, so it can be hard to verify validity. If you ever question the legitimacy of an email, try going directly to that company's website rather than clicking links in emails or downloading attachments.\nReporting Phishing\nIf you received a suspicious email that claims to be from Capital One or misuses the Capital One brand, do not click any links contained in the message or download any attachments, and instead forward the entire email with the original subject line to abuse@capitalone.com.\nSuspicious Phone Call\nWhat is Phone Phishing?\nPhone phishing, also known as “voice phishing” or “vishing,” occurs when a fraudster calls directly and asks you to do something like provide personal information like credit card information, Social Security numbers, and login credentials.\nHow to Identify Phone Phishing\nMany of the phishing indicators also apply to vishing attacks, such as an urgent timeline or intimidating language. You can also spot phone phishing using the following helpful hints:\nDo Not Comply. If the caller leaves a message, you can listen to their message, but DO NOT comply with their demands.\nWhen In Doubt, Call It Out. It is fairly easy to spoof the number for an incoming call. If you receive a suspicious call that is claiming to be from an actual company, call the company directly to verify whether the request is legitimate. You can also search the web for the suspicious phone number to see if it routes back to a legitimate source.\nReporting Phone Phishing\nIf you receive a suspicious phone call that claims to be from Capital One, do not provide the caller with any account information, and end the call. See our Communication Guidelines below for how you can tell if the call is legitimate.\nReport the suspicious phone call to abuse@capitalone.com. Be sure to include in your email the phone number that called you and the information the person was trying to acquire.\nIf you provided a caller with information related to your account and think the inquiry was suspicious, contact us using the number on the back of your credit card.\nSuspicious Text Message\nWhat is Text Message Phishing?\nText message phishing, or “SMS phishing,” occurs when a fraudster uses text messages appearing to be from a legitimate source in order to entice individuals to reveal personal information like credit card information, Social Security numbers, and login credentials.\nHow to Identify Text Message Phishing\nDon’t Do Business Via Text. A legitimate business will never ask you to reveal your account number, user name, password, or full Social Security number via text message.\nKnow the Signs. Just as with email and phone phishing, be aware of urgent language, grammar or spelling errors, or unknown senders. Furthermore, be wary of clicking on shortened URL links like TinyURL or Bitly.\nReporting Text Message Phishing\nIf you receive a suspicious text message that claims to be from Capital One, do not reply to the message or click on any links within the message.\nInstead take a screenshot of the message and send the screenshot to abuse@capitalone.com. Be sure to include the sending phone number and the content of the message. After sending the information to Capital One abuse@capitalone.com, delete the text message from your mobile phone.\nIf you clicked a link and provided information related to your account, contact us using the number on the back of your credit card if you think the text was suspicious.\nIf you’re having issues accessing your account, please use the online Password Reset tool to reset your password. Whether you're using a mobile device or a computer, navigate to the Password Reset tool by selecting the “Forgot Username or Password?” link on the sign in page.\nOnce you have reached the Password Reset tool, complete a few security steps to reset your password and access your account.\nHere are the steps to reset the password and access your account:\n1. Go to https://verified.capitalone.com/auth/signin\n2. Select “Forgot Username or Password?” link\n3. Enter your information and select “Find Me”\n4. Complete any security steps to recover your username\n5. If you’d like to reset the password, select “Verify Me”\n6. Complete additional security steps and enter a new password\nKeep in mind: Temporary passwords expire after a period of time. Please check the email containing your temporary password to ensure it’s still valid.

  "text": "Your money is safe at Capital One\nCapital One, N.A., is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an independent federal agency. The FDIC insures balances up to $250,000 held in various types of consumer and business deposit accounts.\nCapital One customers don’t need to purchase or apply for FDIC insurance—coverage up to the FDIC’s limit is automatic whenever a deposit account is opened.\nHere’s how FDIC insurance works\nDeposits in checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit are insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank and per ownership type. \nThe amount of FDIC insurance coverage you may have depends on your account’s FDIC ownership category, such as:\nSingle account: owned by one person with no beneficiaries\nJoint account: owned by two or more people with no beneficiaries\nTrust account: owned by one or more trustees on behalf of one or more beneficiaries \nBusiness account: owned by a corporation, partnership or unincorporated association\nAll deposits that an account holder has in the same ownership category, within the same bank, are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount of $250,000. Business account deposits are also insured—up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership type—separately from the personal accounts of the business entity's stockholders, partners or members.\nCan I have more than $250,000 worth of deposit insurance at Capital One?\nYes. In some instances, account holders may be entitled to more than $250,000 of FDIC insurance. Deposits held in different ownership categories are separately insured, up to $250,000 for each, even if held at the same bank. \nHere are three examples:\nA single account titled Jane Doe would be insured up to $250,000.\nA joint account titled Jane Doe and John Smith would be insured up to $250,000 for both depositors for a total of $500,000. \nA revocable trust account with one owner naming three unique beneficiaries would be insured up to $750,000.* \n(*See “Revocable and Irrevocable Trust Accounts” for more information on how deposit insurance is calculated for these types of accounts.)\nHow do I know what’s covered?\nFor more information about the different FDIC ownership categories and the amount of coverage available to you or your beneficiaries, you can visit the FDIC’s What’s Covered page.\nYou may be able to increase your coverage under certain scenarios. To learn more about ways to increase your coverage, refer to the FDIC’s Your Insured Deposits page to view possible scenarios to maximize your coverage.",

For example, we use these tools to collect information for debugging, fraud prevention, session management, and other necessary purposes. We also use these to conduct personalization, analytics, and targeted advertising on or through the Online Services. We may associate this tracking data with your Capital One account (if you have one).\nThese tools include:\nServer logs. Server logs automatically record information and details about your online interactions with us. For example, server logs may record information about your visit to our website on a particular time and day.\nCookies. Cookies are small text files that a website’s server stores in your web browser. Cookies allow companies to recognize your device and store information about your account and preferences. For example, we may use cookies to store information about pages visited on our sites, language preferences, your relationship with us, or other information that we have associated with you or your device. You may be able to manage cookies on your device.\nPixel tags. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon, clear GIF, pixel, or tag) is an image or a small string of code that may be placed in a website, advertisement, or email. It allows companies to set or read cookies or transfer information to their servers when you load a webpage or interact with online content. For example, we or our service providers may use pixel tags to determine whether you have interacted with a specific part of our website, viewed a particular advertisement, or opened a specific email.\nSDKs and mobile advertising IDs. Our mobile applications may include third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your mobile app activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA and Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes.\nThird-party plugins. Our Online Services may include plugins from other companies, including social media companies (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button). These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the plugin. These third-party plugins are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.\nHow does Capital One use online tracking technology to conduct personalization, analytics, targeted advertising, and how can you opt out?\nWe and third-party providers acting on our behalf use online tracking technology to conduct personalization, analytics, and targeted advertising on or through the Online Services.\nPersonalization.

In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, we may use the information we collect about you online, alone or in combination with information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information, or the state in which you bank). We also use online tracking technologies to recognize your computer or device when you’re logged in, enable enhanced features or functionality, improve usability, and otherwise provide the Online Services to you.\nAnalytics. We and our third-party providers use online tracking technologies to engage in data analytics, auditing, measurement, research, reporting, and debugging on our Online Services and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising.

We and our third-party providers may collect information about your activities on our Online Services and across different websites, mobile apps, and devices over time for targeted advertising purposes. These providers may then show you ads, including across the internet and mobile apps, and other devices, based in part on the information they have collected or that we have shared with them.\nFor example, when you visit the Capital One website and explore our products, our advertising providers may use that information to determine which ads to show you when you go to other, non-Capital One websites. Similarly, when you view a Capital One ad on your computer, our advertising providers may use that information when deciding whether to show you a subsequent ad on your laptop or mobile device.

You will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete cookies, change web browsers, reset your mobile advertising ID, or use a different device, you may need to opt out again. Our Online Services do not function differently in response to browser “Do Not Track” signals, but you may opt out of certain targeted advertising as described above.\nLearn more about how we use online tracking technologies.\nManage cookies on your device\nYou may be able to set your web browser to tell you when cookies are set, delete your cookies, or block cookies altogether.

  "text": "Estimate your monthly payment by entering your loan amount, Annual Percentage Rate (APR), and loan term length.\nEstimating Your Monthly Car Payment\nShopping for a new vehicle can be stressful, especially when it comes time to calculate car payments. But with the right tools, you can simplify your car-buying process. By using an auto payment calculator, you can generate an accurate estimate for your car loan to see whether a potential purchase falls within your budget. \nWhile some calculators can be complicated to use, Capital One Auto Loan Calculator is straightforward, requiring just three key pieces of information: loan amount, term length, and annual percentage rate (APR). \nYour loan amount could either be the cost of your car or the amount you anticipate needing to borrow. Since you may plan on contributing a down payment or trading in a vehicle to lower the overall cost of the purchase, consider what your loan amount will be after these additional contributions toward your vehicle purchase. \nDepending on the length of your car loan, your monthly payment may increase or decrease. You can choose loan terms of 36, 48, 60, or 72 months to see how your monthly payment changes if your other variables stay the same. But keep in mind that while longer loan terms may have lower monthly payments, they also typically come with a higher interest rate. This means you could end up owing more over the lifetime of your loan, even as your vehicle depreciates. \nDetermining your APR will likely depend on your credit score, national rates, and other industry factors. You could get pre-qualified for a loan and receive an APR to calculate your monthly payment. Once you have an estimated APR, you can enter it into the auto payment calculator and see how it might affect your monthly payments. \nUsing these key pieces of car loan information, you can generate as many estimates as you need to inform your car-financing decision. Whether you're buying a new car or refinancing your current vehicle, using a monthly payment calculator can help you get a clearer picture of how your anticipated costs align with your budget. \nWhat is Auto Loan Interest?\nAuto loan interest is the extra cost in addition to your loan principal — your starting loan amount — that lenders charge you for borrowing money. Your interest rate is calculated as a percentage of your remaining balance of debt. Each month when you make your payment, a portion will go toward paying down your principal, while the remainder goes toward accrued interest. Once your interest rate is determined and laid out in your loan terms, your lender will calculate your interest and add it to your monthly payments. \nYour auto lender will most likely use simple interest to calculate your monthly rate. This means interest will be calculated based on the remaining car-loan balance when your monthly payment is due. Simple-interest car loans front-load your monthly interest payments, meaning you pay more toward interest at the beginning of your loan and more toward your balance at the end. Since interest is determined by your remaining monthly balance, the more you can pay toward your auto loan per month, the less interest you will pay over time. A monthly payment calculator will typically estimate your car payment using simple interest. \nAuto Loan Tips\nChecking your credit score can help you gauge your loan approval chances. Understanding your credit history and current credit score may help you make a more informed decision on your auto loan. Credit scores are a key factor when lenders are deciding whether or not to finance your car purchase, and often will determine your car loan interest rates and acceptance. Checking your credit before applying for a car loan may help you resolve any discrepancies and put you in a better position for approval. \nMaking a down payment could lead to long-term savings. Saving up for a down payment may reduce the overall costs of your auto loan. Down payments not only help lower your monthly payments, they could also reduce your total auto loan interest. Most experts recommend a 20% down payment for new cars and 10% for used. \nGetting pre-approval might provide clarity on potential interest rates. Pre-approved auto loans can provide insight into the potential interest rate your lender will be able to offer. If the estimate doesn't match your budget, you have the option to look for financing options elsewhere. However, keep in mind that pre-approval often requires a hard credit check that could impact your credit score if you don't make a financing decision quickly. \nShopping around for car loans could lead to savings. Shopping for car loans could potentially hurt your credit through multiple hard credit pulls, but taking advantage of rate-shopping windows could help you get the information you need with minimal impact on your credit. Credit scoring companies like TransUnion allow car shoppers a 14-day grace period, during which multiple credit checks can count as one. Using this window to get the information you need can help you apply for a loan that best suits your budget.",

  "text": "1. \nWhat is a credit report and how can I get a copy? \nCredit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian, and Transunion, create your credit report, which is a detailed report of your credit history based on information that’s been provided to CRAs by “furnishers” like lenders and auto finance companies. Credit reports contain a range of information—everything from personal details like names and Social Security numbers to specifics about auto loan payments and repossessions. It gives a view of your overall credit and debt history, like how often you make payments on time, how much credit you have, and how much credit you're using. Reviewing credit reports helps lenders decide if they will loan money to you and what interest rates and other terms they will offer.\nYou can get a free copy of your credit report from CRAs directly or at AnnualCreditReport.com. Learn more about how to check your credit report.\n2. \nWhat is the role of credit reporting agencies and Capital One Auto Finance in determining what information is shown on my credit report? \nCredit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, prepare your credit report. A CRA receives credit information from “furnishers,” like lenders and auto finance companies, that extend credit. Information provided by furnishers, including Capital One Auto Finance, must be accurate and complete. We furnish information on payment history, such as whether you made your payment on time or late. On a monthly basis, we notify the CRAs that accounts 30 days or more past due are delinquent. If applicable, we may also include an account’s status, such as whether a vehicle was repossessed or an account was paid in full or settled in full for less than the full balance. \n3. \nWhen and how do auto financing credit inquiries show up on my credit report?\nIf you sign a credit application for auto financing at a dealership, the dealer may submit your credit application to multiple lenders. Lenders who receive your application may submit a request to the credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, to view your credit report. These inquiries generate a hard credit check (also known as a \"pull,\" \"inquiry\" or \"hit\") and may be visible on your credit report for two years, even for the lenders who do not fund your loan. Note that when multiple lender credit checks occur within a certain timing window—typically within 14 to 45 days—CRAs may lump them together, counting them as one credit check.\nIf you request pre-qualification for auto financing or refinancing from Capital One online, we will submit a soft credit check to the CRA(s). Soft credit checks are only visible to you on credit reports and don’t impact your credit score.\n4. \nHow long does my auto loan information stay on my credit report?\nCredit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, decide when, how, and for how long the information furnished to the CRA will display on your credit report. CRAs determine how long they will report information about a specific account (i.e., tradeline), as permitted by law. Late payment information could remain on a credit report for up to 7 years; account statuses in certain situations (e.g., bankruptcy) could remain on a credit report for up to 10 years. \nOf important note, delinquent payment history is not deleted from your credit report once you become current, pay your balance in full, or settle an account for less than the full balance owed. In other words, your past negative payment history is not replaced by future positive payment history. This is one reason why it is very important to make each and every monthly payment on time.\n5. \nCan I get a late auto payment taken off my credit report?\nOn a monthly basis, Capital One Auto Finance notifies credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, that accounts 30 or more days past due are delinquent. CRAs typically display this late payment information on a credit report where it can remain for as long as 7 years. Note that neither you, nor credit repair companies acting on your behalf, have a right to have late payment information removed from credit reports if it is accurate. \n6. \nHow can I dispute information on my credit report if I believe it’s inaccurate or incomplete? \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you the right to dispute information you believe to be incomplete or inaccurate and requires furnishers like Capital One Auto Finance to conduct reasonable investigations of disputes. If you believe that the late payment shown on your credit report is inaccurately reported, you can file a dispute with us or through the credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.\nWe will investigate your dispute using the information provided, and respond within 30 days. If any changes are deemed necessary, note that the CRAs will typically update your credit report(s) within 1-2 billing cycles after the investigation is complete. \nFiling a Dispute with Capital One Auto Finance\nWhen filing your dispute, we strongly encourage you to provide us with the specific information you believe was inaccurately or incompletely reported (such as payment dates or account status), and include supporting information that would help in the investigation (e.g., front and back of check, bank statement, marked-up copy of the credit report, etc.). We recommend downloading and completing our Credit Report Dispute Form and providing all relevant information that explains your situation. Please send your dispute and supporting materials directly to Capital One Auto Finance at the address listed below:\nATTN: COAF Credit Bureau Dispute\nCapital One Auto Finance\nPO Box 259407\nPlano, TX 75025-9407\nFiling a Dispute with the CRAs\nEquifax: (866) 349-5191\nExperian: (888) 397-3742\nTransUnion: (800) 916-8800\nIf you choose to file a dispute with the CRAs, note that dispute-related communications will come from the CRAs, not Capital One.\n7. \nFact or Fiction? Late payments, even when accurately reported, can be removed by simply filing disputes using specific forms and citing certain laws, or by repeatedly submitting the same dispute.\nFiction!\nAs a lender that furnishes information to credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, we have a responsibility to furnish customers’ account and payment information accurately and completely. Please be wary of any online sources or “credit repair” companies advising you to seek removal of accurately reported information by claiming we are violating your Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) or privacy rights by accurately furnishing your information. These companies may even charge you to use their dispute or complaint templates. Note that neither you, nor credit repair companies acting on your behalf, have a right to have late payment information removed from credit reports if it is accurate. Click here to learn more about the following warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: “[b]eware of anyone who claims that they can remove information from your credit report that’s current, accurate and negative. It’s probably a credit repair scam.”\nPlease also understand that when Capital One Auto Finance receives a dispute or complaint related to credit reporting, we conduct an investigation and inform you of the results. Repeatedly submitting the same dispute information without additional supporting documents, even if you do so through different channels, will not change the outcome of our investigation. \n8. \nFact or Fiction? You don’t have to pay back the amount you financed at the terms you agreed to and therefore late payments cannot be reported.\nFiction!\nThere are various theories (often referred to as \"freeman on the land\" or “freeman”-style theories) circulating on social media or elsewhere that allege a borrower is not responsible for repaying the amount they financed. These theories can take different forms, but they are based on flawed arguments. Capital One Auto Finance will not forgive your account balance simply because you submit a freeman-style dispute or complaint. Be wary of any online sources or companies advising you to file disputes claiming that your auto loan debt is invalid under a “freeman” theory. Click here to learn more about the following warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: “[b]eware of anyone who claims that they can remove information from your credit report that’s current, accurate and negative. It’s probably a credit repair scam.”\n9. \nWhat should I do if I think my identity has been stolen?\nIf you are a victim of identity theft, you can file a report with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and with the police. If you notify Capital One Auto Finance of your identity theft claim, please provide supporting documentation, such as an FTC or police report and proof of your identity. We might request that you provide additional supporting documentation beyond these items to assist with our investigation. Once we have completed our investigation, we will notify you of our findings and any action we may take. \nPlease be wary of any online sources recommending you file a false claim of identity theft in order to avoid paying debts owed or to prevent accurate information from appearing on your credit report. Click here to learn more about the following warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: “[b]eware of anyone who claims that they can remove information from your credit report that’s current, accurate and negative. It’s probably a credit repair scam.”\n10. \nHow can I improve my credit score?\nThere are no quick fixes or shortcuts when it comes to boosting your credit score. But if you’re using credit responsibly, you’re on the right track. If you want an idea where you stand, you can use a tool like CreditWise from Capital One. It’s free to all—whether you’re a Capital One customer or not. And using it to check your credit won’t hurt your score.",

Shopping for a used car can seem like a challenge, and you're not alone if you feel this way. Arming yourself with strong questions could help you know what you're getting into.\nWhen shopping around, don't be afraid to grill a salesperson. Off the bat they may lack answers, but that's nothing a little digging on their part can't solve. What about questions to ask when buying a used car from a private party? The good news is that private-party sellers may know more about their cars than dealers do. After all, they've probably been driving the vehicle for a while, and in some cases, they may even have owned it since new.\nHere's a look at several important questions to ask when buying a used car from either a dealer or private party.\nWhat Is the Car's History?\nWhile you can't expect a salesperson to know the history of every vehicle on a big lot, it's always worth asking them what they know about the car. Maybe they handled the trade and can provide some hints about how the previous owners used it. Or they can tell you if it was acquired, as so many cars are, at a dealer-only auction.\nYou'll have better luck with this question in a private-party sale. When inquiring, you're looking to learn about when the seller acquired the car and how they used it. If they were not the vehicle's first owner, they may be able to tell you a little about its past prior to their acquisition. A history of garage storage—as well as whether the car has seen more highway, suburban, or urban use—can be highly desirable.\nAre Any Service Records Included?\nAsking this question can tell you a lot about how fastidious the previous owner has been. Meticulous maintenance with documentation shows an owner who cared about their vehicle and was willing to spend money to keep it going. While you needn't write off a dealer or seller who is unable to provide receipts, the car may need a little more stringent inspection should you choose to go see it.\nHas The Car Been Wrecked or Previously Stolen?\nA \"yes\" to either of these does not have to automatically lead to a \"no\" from you, but it should open some follow-up questions, such as the severity of damages incurred and extensiveness of repairs. Documentation for these items is critical as it can be hard to take a seller at their word.\nIf the car was previously wrecked or stolen and recovered, you'll want to inspect the title closely to ensure it is \"clean,\" meaning the car has not been issued a salvage title at the behest of an insurance company.\nMay I Have a Vehicle History Report?\nTwo major firms provide vehicle history reports that can detail where a car was registered throughout its life, give you a glimpse into its service history, and tell you if it was ever in a wreck or had its odometer altered. Carfax is costlier and more comprehensive than AutoCheck, but using both in tandem can uncover a lot about a car.\nDealers typically provide one or both, but you may need to request the data. Be wary of a dealer who is unwilling to provide a history report. Don't worry if the Carfax or AutoCheck data makes no mention of service history. Not all shops or dealerships report information to those organizations.\nPrivate-party sellers will sometimes provide a Carfax or AutoCheck history report. If they choose not to do so, the seller can provide you with the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) so you can purchase one yourself. While not a car's biography, such documentation often reveals a lot about a vehicle—and it can tell you if the seller has been truthful.\nWhat Problems Have You Had With the Car?\nThis really just applies to private-party sales, but there aren't too many used cars in perfect condition, so let this question rip. Odds are the owner has had at least an item or two repaired, which can add to your pre-purchase peace of mind. There's no reason to fear recent major fixes—if anything, evidence of such work can save you thousands in the long run because someone else took care of those gremlins for you.\nA follow-up to this question can include asking whether there are any open recalls—that is, recalls up to 15 years old left unaddressed. If the seller is unsure (or you want to be certain for yourself), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) maintains a database of open and completed recalls that you can access using the car's VIN.\nAre There Any Current Problems?\nHere's where you can start putting your negotiator's hat on. Hopefully, the seller will disclose any issues even before you go to see the car.\nIf there are smaller issues—especially wear items such as tires or brakes that will eventually need to be replaced on any car—you can do a little research ahead of time to determine the cost of replacement. Armed with that knowledge, you can try to negotiate a lower price.\nWhat Else Is Included With the Car?\nA new car comes with more than just a key. A well-kept used car should retain two keys and remote fobs (if applicable), as well as the owner manuals. These items are important to have, but can be expensive to recover if they've gone missing—modern keys can cost upward of $500 to replace.\nAdditional items to consider include floor mats (both carpeted and winter-ready rubber), roof rack cross bars, luggage covers, or winter wheels and tires. While many dealers will discard service records for privacy reasons, some will provide you with redacted documentation—or at least be able to print out a car's service history if it was maintained in their shop.\nCareful private sellers will likely include the owner's manual and extra keys. Additional items can obviously vary by car, but it's better to ask than not for extras. Furthermore, you can ask if the seller has kept the original window sticker—the federally-mandated document that was affixed to the car's window when it was new. This lists out the vehicle's original specification, including major factory-installed options. This can be useful when comparing cars, and again, it shows the owner may have been meticulous with their vehicle.\nWhat Service Did You Perform to Prepare the Car for Sale?\nA traded-in vehicle is rarely immediately ready to go to a used-car lot, as are many private-party, pre-owned vehicles. Dealerships typically perform at least some servicing, and they will normally be able to provide documentation. The best private sellers do this, too. An oil change and replacement of wiper blades sounds basic, but may save you some money. Bigger work, such as installation of new tires, brake pads and rotors, or even regularly scheduled maintenance, may save you thousands. This kind of work is worth factoring into the price you want to pay for the car.\nIs There a Warranty?\nThere are three kinds of warranties you may find on a used car.\nThe remainder of a factory warranty: A relatively new used car may still have some coverage provided by the manufacturer. A call to the manufacturer's customer service line can verify how much is left.\nA Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) warranty: On a car that has passed a manufacturer-backed CPO inspection, this warranty can provide similar coverage to the factory warranty for as much as two years depending on the brand.\nA dealership-provided warranty: Many dealers will include a short-term warranty—typically three or six months—that can cover certain repairs. While not particularly comprehensive, and often served with strings attached, these warranties can offer peace of mind as long as you've read the fine print first.\nCan I Have an Independent, Pre-Purchase Inspection Performed?\nIf you find that you like the car, a pre-purchase inspection (PPI) from a trustworthy mechanic or repair shop can be worth its weight in gold, as it can determine any underlying issues not immediately visible to an untrained eye.\nA transparent seller should be willing to have such an inspection performed, though typically it is the potential buyer's responsibility to pay for this.\nCan I Return the Car if I Don't Like It?\nYou might be surprised with the answer to this one. Many dealerships have a policy that will let you return a car within a few days (and a few hundred miles) if for some reason you decide it's not the vehicle for you. That said, you can save yourself the hassle by asking about an extended overnight test drive.\nIt should go without saying that posing this question to a private seller won't go over so well. In fact, you might be surprised with the answer, but not in a positive way.\nWritten by humans. \nEdited by humans. \nThis site is for educational purposes only.

The credit is often extended on an open account and payable via an invoice or statement, which can be paper or digital.\nHow is the solution from Capital One Trade Credit different from a credit card?\nA credit card is a payment method used for making purchases at many vendor companies. It comes with a summary statement bill (with no purchase detail), which is payable all in one cycle or revolves with an APR fee. The credit line can be shared for all purchasing needs, which can limit available credit for business purchases with any one supplier. Capital One Trade Credit provides an open account between the seller and buyer with a dedicated line of credit for that purchasing relationship. It's underwritten on the business with a business-sized credit line. It can be billed by invoice for each purchase or as a monthly statement, which does provide purchase detail such as Level III data. Our solution also provides all necessary support, such as real-time decisioning, cardless omnichannel purchasing, upfront funding on the sale, billing, servicing, collections, cash app (to support the entire AR lifecycle) and account management tools for merchants and their customers.\nHow is the solution from Capital One Trade Credit different from factoring?\nWith factoring, a company sells its invoices or AR to a third party, which provides cash up front to the company and then tracks down payment on the invoices. With our solution, we manage your AR for you and pay you up front, but we don’t purchase your invoices or AR. Instead, we partner with you through the longer term and manage all steps throughout your AR lifecycle. That includes mitigating credit risk and using technology and people to grow sales, improve processes and remove friction in the overall B2B experience. We also offer underwriting for customers and funding for merchants, which is not provided by factoring companies.\nHow is the solution from Capital One Trade Credit different from automated AR software?\nAutomated AR software typically only specializes in one or two areas of AR, such as invoicing and payment portals. Capital One Trade Credit offers a full-service AR solution—everything from credit application decisioning and underwriting to invoice generation, cash application and collections. We can also service your customer base, reduce risk and provide fraud monitoring.\nArticle|May 21, 2024\n|7 min read \nArticle|May 20, 2024\n|7 min read \nArticle|May 17, 2024\n|4 min read",

Kids can sign in and check their balance online 24/7, but transferring money requires a little help from the adult on the account.

Pay your bills, get cash, make deposits, and transfer money—all without monthly fees and extra trips to the bank. You can open a checking account online and manage your account securely by signing in on your phone or computer, instead of waiting for the bank to open first. And if you ever need help with your account, a real person is just a phone call away.\nThere are no fees to open, keep or use your Capital One 360 Checking account, or for foreign transactions. There may be some things you want or need to do with your account that will result in charges.

  "text": "Wire Transfer Disclosure Statement\nIn this Wire Transfer Disclosure Statement and Agreement (this \"Agreement\"), the words \"you\" and \"your\" mean the account owner, and the words \"us,\" \"we,\" and \"our\" mean Capital One, N.A. This Agreement defines your responsibilities and our responsibilities with respect to domestic transfers of funds from your account(s) with us for credit to an account at another financial institution or another account with us (“Wire Transfer”). You understand that, except as specifically modified by this Agreement, your account(s) will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions contained in other agreements and/or disclosures that you have been provided with in connection with your account(s), which are incorporated herein by reference. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as set forth in Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code and, to the extent applicable, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and its implementing regulations.\nHow to request a wire transfer: To send a wire transfer, log in to initiate a wire request (“Wire Money”) using our online wire form. The beneficiary and dollar amount for a Wire Transfer under this agreement may be limited. These limits are designed to be flexible in order to protect the security and integrity of the service and accounts, as well as you and all other users of the service. Based on confidential fraud and essential risk criteria, they may be modified at our discretion without advance notice. The types of wire transfers that can be initiated, the eligible recipients, and applicable limits will be identified to you when you set up a Wire Transfer online. We reserve the right to reject any Wire Transfer Request. We may restrict the use of wire transfers for new accounts and newly added joint account holders.\nMethod used to execute the wire transfer: We may select any means for the transmission of funds that we consider suitable, including but not limited to Fedwire. We may make use of correspondents, agents, subagents, and funds transfer and communication systems. Such third parties shall be deemed your agents, and we shall not be liable for any errors, delay, misdelivery, or failure of delivery by any of them unless applicable law says otherwise.\nCut-off times: We have cut-off hours for processing Wire Transfers. If a wire request is received by 2:00pm ET and verified through our security procedures outlined in the section below titled “Security Procedures,” funds will be processed the same business day. If it is received after 2:00pm ET and verified through our security procedures, funds may be processed the next business day. We may treat any Wire Transfer Request received at or after our cut-off time as if it was received that business day, or we may treat it as if it were received at the opening of the next business day.\nSecurity procedures: You agree and consent to the use of certain security procedures by us to confirm the validity of the Wire Transfer Request made pursuant to this Agreement. You understand the security procedures are not designed to detect errors in the content of the Wire Transfer Request or to prevent duplicate transfers. Some elements of the procedures will vary, depending upon the method used to initiate a Wire Transfer. You hereby agree that your utilization of any security procedure established hereunder shall constitute your agreement to its use and affirmative acknowledgment of its commercial reasonableness. You further agree that any Wire Transfer Request that is acted upon in good faith by us in compliance with these security procedures, whether or not in fact authorized by you, shall constitute an authorized Wire Transfer. The following security procedures shall apply to this Agreement: Before accepting any such Wire Transfer Requests, we will: (1) perform verification on the individuals initiating the Wire Transfer Request that is designed to ensure they are the individuals previously authorized to initiate a Wire Transfer for the account in question; (2) apply fraud-related screens to the wire instructions; (3) contact you using information from your account records to verify the Wire Transfer for wires that are not initiated in person (this contact may be through a method different than the one you used to request the Wire Transfer (e.g., phone versus e-mail) or it may be through the same channel to obtain a password or other information that only you should have); (4) request and receive any other proof of identification or any other documentation from you or your authorized representative, which we may, in our sole discretion, require under the circumstances; and (5) you expressly agree to receive security alerts from us by prerecorded voice message and/or text message, including with the use of an automatic dialer (autodialer), at any mobile device number you provide to us.\nForce majeure: We will not be liable for our inability to perform our obligations under this Agreement when such inability arises out of causes beyond our control, including but not limited to, any act of God, accident, labor disputes, power failures, system failure, equipment malfunction, suspension of payment by another bank, refusal or delay by another bank to accept the wire transfer, war, emergency conditions, fire, earthquake, or the failure of any third party to provide any electronic or telecommunication service used in connection with the execution or cancellation of a Wire Transfer.\nInconsistency of name and account number: You acknowledge and agree that when you (or your authorized representative) provide us with a name and account number in order for us to process a Wire Transfer, payment may be made by the beneficiary's/designated recipient's bank solely on the basis of the account number, even if the account number identifies a person different from the beneficiary so named. We or an intermediary bank may send a Wire Transfer to an intermediary bank or beneficiary's/designated recipient's bank based solely on the bank identifying number, even if the payment order indicates a different name. We may rely on all information contained in the Wire Transfer Request, regardless of who may have provided the information. You further agree that your obligation to pay the amount of a Wire Transfer to us is not excused in such circumstances. Except as provided by applicable law, any losses resulting from an incorrect account number or your misidentification of the beneficiary/designated recipient is your responsibility and not ours.\nAcceptance and execution of request by Capital One: A Wire Transfer Request is considered accepted by us when we execute it. Please refer to the “Cut-Off Times” section for more details. You can verify whether your Wire Transfer Request has been executed by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nPayment to Capital One: You must pay us the amount of the Wire Transfer, plus any applicable fees, before we will execute the Wire Transfer Request. Please contact the Call Center for fees applicable to Wire Transfers and any other related pre-payment disclosures.\nRejection of a wire transfer: We have no responsibility to accept any incoming Wire Transfer(s) for your benefit. Likewise, we have a right to reject any Wire Transfer Request(s) for an outgoing Wire Transfer for reasons including, but not limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account specified in the Wire Transfer Request, a request that fails the security procedures outlined in the section on Security Procedures, our inability to execute the Wire Transfer for the reasons set out in the section of this agreement entitled Method Used to Make the Wire Transfer above, or if we are unable to verify the authenticity of the Wire Transfer Request. If we stop a domestic outgoing Wire Transfer, we will refund the fee.\nNotice of a wire transfer not executed: If we determine, in our sole discretion, not to honor, execute, or accept a Wire Transfer Request, we will endeavor to notify you, but we shall have no liability for delay or failure to do so. We will also endeavor to notify you promptly if a Wire Transfer is returned to us after its execution but shall have no liability by reason of our delay or failure to do so. We shall have no obligation to resend a Wire Transfer if we complied with the original Wire Transfer Request and such Wire Transfer was returned to us.\nCancellation or amendment of wire transfer: Once we receive a Wire Transfer Request, it may not be able to be canceled or amended. However, at our discretion, we may use reasonable efforts to act on any request for cancellation or amendment, provided that the method by which we are notified of a request for cancellation or amendment complies with our security procedures. However, we shall have no liability if such cancellation or amendment is not affected. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, damages, costs, and expenses we may incur in attempting to cancel or amend the Wire Transfer. Any cancellation or amendment of a Wire Transfer by us shall relieve us of any obligation to act on the original Wire Transfer Request.\nAccount statements: Except as provided by applicable law, you agree that we are not required to provide you with a separate notice of incoming or outgoing Wire Transfer. All Wire Transfers will be reflected on your periodic bank statement. You should review your statement for any discrepancies, unauthorized transactions, or errors in connection with any Wire Transfers. Except as otherwise provided herein, if you think a Wire Transfer is wrong or if you need more information about a Wire Transfer, you must contact us in writing upon discovery of the error or within fourteen (14) days from the date your statement is postmarked or otherwise made available to you, whichever is earlier. Failure to do so will relieve us of any obligation to pay interest on the amount of an unauthorized or erroneous Wire Transfer for which we are liable. Furthermore, you will also be liable to us for any damages or losses we may incur as a result of your failure to notify us within the time period stated in this section.\nChange in authorized representative: Any changes in the authority of persons authorized to make a Wire Transfer on your behalf shall not be binding upon us until we have received written notice from you. The notice must be in a form acceptable to us and be given within a reasonable period of time for us to act upon the change.\nDuty of reasonable care: We shall exercise good faith and reasonable care in processing Wire Transfer Requests. You shall similarly exercise good faith and reasonable care in observing and maintaining security procedures, in communicating Wire Transfer Requests to us, and in reviewing periodic bank statements for any discrepancies.\nLiability of Capital One: We shall be responsible only for performing the Wire Transfer Service expressly provided for in this Agreement; provided however, we shall be liable only for our own gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing such service. We shall not be liable to any third party or for any act or omission of yours or any third party, including, but not limited to, third parties used by us in executing a Wire Transfer or performing a related act and no such third party shall be deemed to be our agent. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WIRE TRANSFER SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SAME. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the maximum period for which we shall be liable for interest on any amount to be refunded or paid to you with respect to an unauthorized, erroneous, or other Wire Transfer Request is thirty days.\nInterest compensation: In the event we are liable to you for interest compensation under this Agreement, or applicable law, interest shall be calculated at the average of the federal funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank for the period involved; or at such other rate that we may agree to, in writing, from time to time.\nLiability of the customer: Except as otherwise provided by law, you shall be liable for any loss or damage to which your negligence contributed or which resulted in unauthorized, fraudulent, or dishonest acts by your current and/or former authorized representatives. Such liability includes instances when a current or former authorized representative effects one or more Wire Transfers or improper use of telephone security procedures to effect a Wire Transfer to your detriment.\nCompliance with anti-money laundering and exchange control regulations and OFAC enforced sanctions: You covenant with us to observe all Anti-Money Laundering and Exchange Control laws and regulations including economic and trade sanctions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury in relation to any Wire Transfer, and you will use all reasonable endeavors to assist us to do likewise. In particular, you covenant that the information given to us by you is accurate. We may disclose any information given to us that we in our sole discretion think necessary or desirable to disclose; except we will only disclose confidential information if required by law, a court, or legal, regulatory, or governmental authority, or as permitted by law in order to combat, prevent, or investigate issues arising under anti-money laundering laws, economic sanctions, or criminal law.\nSometimes legal, regulatory, or governmental authorities require additional information, either in respect of individuals, entities, or particular transactions. You agree to promptly supply all such information, which any such authority may require, and/or which we may be required to supply, in relation to the individual, entity, or particular transaction.\nIf you, or your authorized representative, breach any such laws or regulations, you irrevocably agree that we may retain any monies or funds transmitted to us pursuant to this Agreement and/or not fulfill any Wire Transfer Request if we are required to take or refrain from such action by any legal, regulatory, or governmental authority or if we reasonably believe that such action may violate any laws or regulations described herein, and such monies shall not bear interest against us. You further agree that we may pay such monies to the appropriate legal, regulatory, or governmental authority, if and when required by law.\nIndemnification: In consideration of Capital One agreeing to accept Wire Transfer Requests in the manner set forth herein, you shall forever indemnify and hold Capital One, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, successors, predecessors, representatives, principals, agents, assigns, parents, subsidiaries and/or insurers harmless from and against all liability, claims, damages, costs, claims, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that we may incur without regard to the merit or lack thereof, arising out of, or related in any way to the matters set forth herein, or to the Wire Transfer Service, which shall be provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Your agreement to indemnify us and hold us harmless shall survive the expiration and/or termination of this Agreement and all provisions contained herein.\nRecording of communication: You agree that all telephone conversations made in connection with the Agreement may be recorded and retained by us.\nTermination of agreement: We may terminate the right to make Wire Transfers at any time or amend or change the terms of this Agreement or cancel this Agreement without advance notice to you.\nAgreement controls: Both you and Capital One will be bound by this Agreement. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and something said by one of our employees, you agree that this Agreement controls. This Agreement and the terms of the Account Agreement(s) related to your deposit accounts, which are incorporated herein by reference, constitute the entire Agreement between you and us regarding your use of the Wire Transfer Service. If any inconsistency exists between the account disclosure statements and agreement(s) and this Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control. No representation or statement not expressly contained in this Agreement or in any amendment hereto shall be binding upon you or us.\nGoverning law: All actions arising out of or concerning the Wire Transfer Service or these terms and conditions shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury. In any such action, Capital One shall be entitled to its reasonable attorneys' fees. The Wire Transfer Service and these terms and conditions shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Virginia without regard to its conflicts of rules and the laws of the United States.\nSeverability: In the event that any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of the Agreement is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.",

  "text": "360 Certificate of Deposit agreement\nThe basics: Here's a quick overview of how your account works. You can open an account in your name alone or in your name and the name of one other person. You \"link\" your Capital One account to a personal (non-business) checking or savings account at another U.S. chartered bank (\"Linked Account\") to fund your CD account. Or you can transfer money from an eligible Capital One checking or savings account to fund your CD. It's that simple!\nNow that you have the basics, here are the detailed Terms that govern your Capital One account. Please understand that when you submit an application, open an account or use our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. When you see the words \"you\" and \"your,\" they mean each person who owns an account or each trustee who is legally entitled to manage an account. \"Our,\" \"us,\" and \"we\" mean Capital One, N.A.\nWho can open an account: You must be a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident with a U.S. physical address located in one of the 50 United States or Washington, D.C., or with military addresses (APO or FPO). In order to open an account, you must be at least 18 years old with a valid Social Security Number, and with a U.S.-based mobile phone number. Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) are acceptable for account opening in Branches and Capital One Cafés and your Linked Account must be with a bank chartered in the U.S.\nHow to open an account: You must electronically transfer money from your Linked Account. Your 360 CD account won’t be considered “opened” until it’s funded and you complete our verification procedures.\nAccount limits: We reserve the right to limit the number of accounts you may open at our discretion and without advanced notice.\nObtaining credit reports: We may request a consumer (credit) report in connection with your account(s). Upon your request, you will be informed whether or not a consumer (credit) report was requested, and if such report was requested, informed of the name and address of the consumer (credit) reporting agency that furnished the report. We may also request subsequent consumer (credit) reports for all legitimate purposes in connection with updating, renewing, reviewing, modifying, and/or taking collection action on your account(s).\nReporting information to consumer reporting agencies and check verifications systems: We may report information about your account to consumer reporting agencies and/or check verification systems. Defaults on your account may be reflected in your consumer report. This could affect your ability to open accounts in the future. In the event we report your account to a check verification system, you acknowledge that even if you pay us all amounts owed, we are not required to remove an accurate report of account mishandling from any such check verification system.\nConsumer account: Your 360 CD account is a consumer account and must be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If you fail to comply with these conditions, or use your account for business purposes, we may restrict use of, or close your account.\nTypes of account ownership:\nIndividual account. This type of account is owned by one person only.\nJoint account. This type of account is owned by two or more people and all deposits made into the account are owned by all registered account owners. Except for certain retirement benefits like Social Security, if one person dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). The owners of the account are considered to be \"joint tenants\" with right of survivorship. Any owner of the account may: (i) early withdraw and close the account without the other owner's consent; (ii) pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us.\nIf one joint owner requests that we not pay items authorized by a different joint owner, we may restrict the account and refuse to pay all items (including items authorized by the owner making the request), but we are not required to do so. If we restrict the account, we may not release the restriction unless all joint owners agree in writing to remove it. No request to restrict the account will affect items that we paid before the request. If we decide not to restrict the account, all joint owners remain responsible for items subtracted from the account.\nWe may also pay all or any part of the funds in the account to a court or government agency if we receive a garnishment, levy or similar legal process that identifies any of the joint owners.\nJoint account with minor. This type of account is owned by one minor (under age 18) and one adult, and the owners of the account are called \"joint tenants.\" If the minor is 12 years of age or younger, then a parent or legal guardian must be a joint owner. Except for certain benefits like Social Security, if one account holder dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). Any owner of the account may transfer funds without the other owner's consent, but only the Adult account holder may withdraw funds to another bank.\nRevocable living trust (also known as inter-vivos trust) account. This type of account is owned by a living trust and is managed by one or more Trustee(s) (“Trustee/Co-Trustees”). If the Trust requires Co-Trustees to act jointly, all Co-Trustees acknowledge that we cannot comply with multiple-signature requirements, and that each Trustee has obtained the necessary consent before performing a transaction. For example, this means that any Co-Trustee may: (i) tell us to pay a person or company; (ii) withdraw or transfer the balance without the other Co-Trustees providing consent to Capital One; (iii) make deposits, close or pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us; or (iv) endorse and deposit checks payable to either Co-Trustee or the living trust. Each Co-Trustee can enter a stop payment order on any payments or other orders of withdrawal authorized by either Co-Trustee. Each Co-Trustee understands and agrees that (s)he, and not Capital One, owes a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of the living trust and as such, shall manage the account in accordance with the terms of the trust document(s) and any applicable laws.\n“Payable on Death” (POD): You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. Only an individual may be designated as a beneficiary. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nConnecting accounts: If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will automatically \"connect\" your eligible accounts so they appear when you're logged into your account through the website or mobile app.\nWe will display only summary information about your \"connected\" accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts and people with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nThings you tell us to do: We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes: You must notify us of any change of address by calling us, or using our secure website. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you've told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (\"USPS\") or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.\nCommunication: You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us), and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nWhile we may be able to provide some customer assistance in languages other than English, we cannot guarantee that customer service will always be available in languages other than English. As a courtesy, we may translate some of our forms, letters and disclosures, including this agreement, into another language. However, many important bank documents, and some products and services related to this account, are provided only in English.\nClosing an account: You can close your account at any time, for any reason. We can close your account at any time, for any reason and without advance notice.\nState laws (called “escheat” or unclaimed property laws) require us to close all your deposit accounts and transfer your money to the state if your accounts are dormant for a period of time as defined by your state of residence. Your account can become dormant if, for 24 months, there is no transactional activity. Your account will remain dormant until funds are transferred to or from the dormant account. If all of your accounts become dormant, you may no longer receive paper statements, but you can still view your accounts online.\nState abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable state. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products are subject to abandoned property laws, including IRAs and CDs. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. We want you to keep your money, not the state! You can avoid the transfer of your money to the state simply by signing into your account, transacting periodically, contacting us, or replying to any abandoned property correspondence.\nAdditional disclosures\nAssignment: No part of an account may be pledged, assigned, given as a gift, or otherwise transferred to a third party without our prior written consent.\nItems sent via mail: Please note that we do not accept mailed-in deposits, and we are not responsible for any items sent to us via mail.\nLien and Set-Off: Unless otherwise prohibited by law, by opening an account, you grant us a security interest (in other words, a \"Lien\") in your deposit accounts with us. That means that at any time and without notice to you, we can use all or any part of the money from your individual or joint accounts to pay any amounts you owe us or any of our affiliates from time to time. (This is what's known as a \"Set-Off\"). Any Set-Off shall be a lawful and valid payment by you of amounts you owe us.\nChange to/waiver of terms: We can add to, delete or make any other changes we want to these Terms at any time. You will be bound by the Changes as soon as we implement them. We will provide advance notice of the change if the law requires us to do so. However, if applicable law requires us to make a Change, you may not receive any prior notice. We can cancel, change or add products, accounts or services whenever we want. We can waive any of our rights under these Terms whenever we want, but this doesn't mean that we'll waive the same rights in the future.\nNo fiduciary obligation: Capital One doesn't assume any fiduciary obligation on your behalf. This means that we don't act as your trustee or financial advisor, and we don't assume any responsibility for your account beyond reasonable care.\nGoverning law and regulations: Your accounts are subject to both federal law and the laws of the state of Virginia, as well as any operating circulars or clearing house rules that apply to us and the rules and regulations of our supervisory authorities (collectively, \"Applicable Laws\"). If there's a conflict between these Terms and Applicable Laws, these Terms will be changed to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Law. If any provision of these Terms is determined by a Court or administrative agency having proper jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, that determination will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.\nLevies, attachments, and other court processes: If we receive a levy, attachment, or other Court process against you or another owner of the account, we may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your account until the legal action is dismissed or satisfied. Any levy, attachment, or other Court process will be subject to our rights of Lien and Set-Off (remember, we talked about these things earlier). You are responsible for any losses, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your account.\nClaims against your account: If we receive a claim against funds in your account, or if we know of or believe that there's a dispute over the ownership or control of funds in your account, we may, if we choose to, place a hold on your account. We can also refuse to pay out any of your funds until we're satisfied that the dispute is settled. We may also close the account and send the balance to the account holder(s) we have on record, decide to rely on our current account records, require a Court Order to act, or take any other action that we feel will protect us. We won't be liable to you for taking any such action.\nDeath, incapacity or termination: If you die or are declared legally incompetent, or, in the case of a living trust account, the living trust is terminated, we can continue to accept and process deposits to your account until we know about the death/incompetency/termination and have a reasonable chance to act.\nNotices to you or us: We shall deem any and all notices to us effective upon receipt by us. Any notice that we give to you will be effective when mailed or electronically transmitted to you at the mailing/email address reflected in our records. Even though we may have provided you account opening disclosures in a language other than English, we may continue to provide you with notices/communications in English. Notice to any one owner of an account constitutes notice to all owners of that account.\nJury trial waiver: All actions arising out of this agreement or concerning your checking account shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury.\nEvents beyond our control: We'll make all reasonable efforts to give you access to your accounts and accurate information. However, you agree that we're not responsible for any interruption in service or loss caused by things that are beyond our control, such as natural disasters, wars, riots, strikes, computer failures, or losses of power, communications or transportation facilities. We won't be responsible for any direct losses or damages resulting from use of the account, unless we were negligent or acted in bad faith. We're never responsible for any indirect, special or consequential losses or damages.",

  "text": "The \"Send Money with Zelle®\" (person-to-person transfers) feature is available for Young Adults 13 and older within the mobile experience, and only upon consent of the Adult. The Young Adult can send up to $500 per day via Zelle® unless this limit is lowered by the Adult. The Young Adult cannot use the feature if the Adult revokes or removes permission. When the Young Adult reaches the age of 18, the limit set by the Adult will remain. However, the Adult will no longer be able to control the Young Adult’s use of Zelle®. If no limits have been set by the Adult, Zelle® transactions will then be subject to limits on the amount and frequency of transfers to and from your account. These limits are designed to be flexible in order to protect the security and integrity of the service and accounts, including protecting you and all other users of the service. These limitations may be based on confidential fraud and risk criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of you and the integrity of the service and may be modified at our sole discretion without advance notice. See \"Sending Money Using Zelle®\" for more details.\nMONEY debit card -\nMONEY is designed specifically for young adults, so the card cannot be used with businesses that primarily provide services that may not be appropriate for young adults.\nFor the account owner who is less than 18 years old:\nTotal card purchases and withdrawals are limited to $500 per day. This includes ATM withdrawals, cash advances, and signature and PIN-based purchases. Withdrawals from an ATM made using a MONEY Card are limited to $500 per day. You can lower this limit by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nFor account owners who are at least 18 years old:\nTotal card purchases and withdrawals are limited to $5,000 per day. This includes ATM withdrawals, cash advances, and signature and PIN-based purchases. Daily limits on withdrawals from an ATM made using your account’s ATM/debit card are set based on confidential fraud and risk criteria that are essential to your protection and the integrity of the service and may be modified at our sole discretion without advance notice. You can check your daily withdrawal limit on the Capital One Mobile App or by calling us at 1-800-655-2265. You can also lower your limit by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nMONEY agreement\nThe basics: MONEY is an electronic transactional account that pays a variable rate of interest and allows you to make withdrawals by using a debit card or by transferring funds to any other Capital One account you have (except existing Certificates of Deposit) or your Linked Account. You need to read this agreement and hold on to it in case you have any questions down the road. Please understand that by applying for or using MONEY, you're doing 2 things. First, you're agreeing to be bound by the terms of this agreement, in addition to any other agreements you have entered into with us. Second, you're asking us to automatically issue a MONEY Debit Card (the \"Card\") to the Young Adult. The Adult will not get a Card.\nMONEY mobile service overview\nBy use of your MONEY account, we are providing features through the Capital One mobile app, which may change from time to time, to help the Adult use the Account to help the Young Adult learn and practice money management.\nAdults have features to send ad-hoc (one-time) transfers, set an allowance (recurring transfer), lock or unlock the Young Adult’s card, set ATM and spending limits, and control the Young Adult’s access to use Zelle® to send money to friends and family.\nYoung Adults can distribute their balance between “Spendable” (amounts allocated towards spending) and “Set Aside” (amounts allocated towards saving), and set up a savings goal. Such features can provide an easy way for the Young Adult to see the interaction between spending and saving. Please note that while the Young Adult can designate part of their balance as “Set Aside” for the purpose of trying to save money, the money remains in the account and does not have a separate interest rate. In addition, if any transaction exceeds the Young Adult’s Spendable allocation, the Set Aside allocation will be used.\nThe Young Adult can also lock/unlock, reorder, and change PIN for their debit card. Young adults are prevented from taking this action if the adult has locked the card.\nIn-app feedback\nUsers can submit suggestions via the MONEY account mobile experience. This feedback helps us improve the user experience. This form is intended for users aged 13 and older, but the Adult can submit feedback on behalf of the Young Adult. Do not include non-public information such as account number or social security number. Please note, we cannot respond directly to feedback submitted through this form. For complaints, transaction disputes, and other issues, please call Capital One at 1-800-655-2265.\nAs an 18 year old, the Young Adult will be able to explore, apply for, and open other Capital One products on their own, and they may be made aware of this ability in the app or Capital One unless they have opted out of such offerings. See the Bank’s Privacy Policy here.\nTech support\nWe may or may not provide you with technical and other support for the Service. You agree to abide by any support rules and policies that we establish in order to receive such support. If such support is provided, it will be provided in addition to your normal support for your Capital One Accounts.\nTermination of use; discontinuation; and modification of the service\nIf you violate any provision of these Terms, your permission to use the Service will terminate automatically. Additionally, we, in our sole discretion, may terminate your MONEY Account on the Service or suspend or terminate access to any part or all of the Service at any time, with or without notice.

The Capital One Online Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of these Terms.\nAdditional Terms. Your use of the Service is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Service or certain features of the Service that we may post on or link to on the Service (the \"Additional Terms\"), such as end-user license agreements for any downloadable applications that we may offer, or rules applicable to particular features or content on the Service or additional services. All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of these Terms.\nChanges to the terms\nWe reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time.

All other changes are effective upon publication of the changed Terms. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.\nOwnership; proprietary rights; feedback\nThe visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service (the “Materials”) provided by us are protected by all relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights and applicable laws. All Materials contained in the Service are the property of us or our third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by us you may not make use of the Materials. We reserve all rights to the Materials not granted expressly in these Terms.\nYou may provide us with, or we may solicit your feedback, ideas, or suggestions with respect to the Services, and you hereby grant us a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, sublicensable, full-paid up, irrevocable, royalty free license to use such feedback in future modifications of the Service, other products or services, or marketing or materials. We will not, however, disclose such feedback in a way that would identify you, without obtaining your permission.\nIndemnity\nYou agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Capital One, N.A. and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (collectively, the \"Capital One Entities\") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Service; (ii) your violation of these Terms or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.\nGeneral\nThese Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and us, regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration.\nAdditional terms We can add eligibility requirements to use the Service at any time.\nYou will follow all laws, regulations, and terms related to the Service.\nThe Service can be affected by the terms of other agreements you have with other parties including those for your mobile telephone and any mobile service. We have no responsibility or obligations under any of these agreements, and the Terms will not change any of your rights and obligations under them.\nYour promises to us – including your indemnification of us – will continue even after the Terms ends.\nAll of our affiliated entities and parties you indemnify under the Terms will be third party beneficiaries of the Terms and entitled to directly rely on its provisions and enforce it. No other person or party will have rights or claims under the Terms.\nIf any provision of the Terms is found to not be enforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain valid and enforceable. You and we will work in good faith to substitute other enforceable terms that are similar to those that are unenforceable. Our failure to enforce any term(s) of the Terms will not be a waiver or affect our right to later enforce them.\nEligible customers: MONEY is available to United States citizens or lawful permanent residents with a U.S. physical address located in one of the 50 United States or Washington, D.C., or with military addresses (APO or FPO). Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) are acceptable for account opening in Branches and Capital One Cafés and your Linked Account must be with a bank chartered in the U.S. MONEY must have two owners, the \"Adult\" who must be at least 18 years old and the \"Young Adult\". The “Adult” must be the parent or legal guardian of the “Young Adult”. We may restrict the Young Adult's access to some features of MONEY. The Adult on the account must have either (i) an existing, active deposit account with Capital One that's in good standing; or (ii) a personal (non-business) checking account at another U.S. chartered bank that can and will be linked to your MONEY (the \"Linked Account\").\nYou must also be a paperless Customer - that means that (i) you must keep us supplied with your valid email address; and (ii) you must agree to accept electronic delivery of all communications (like end-of-year tax forms and electronic statements) that we need or decide to send you.\nAccount opening: You can only open MONEY on our interactive website. If you already have an account with us when you open MONEY, your existing Linked Account(s) will also be linked to your MONEY. We reserve the right to verify that you are the owner of the Linked Account. Your MONEY account won’t be considered “opened” until it’s funded. This means your balance must be at least a penny.\nObtaining credit reports: We may request a consumer (credit) report in connection with your account(s). Upon your request, you will be informed whether or not a consumer (credit) report was requested, and if such report was requested, informed of the name and address of the consumer (credit) reporting agency that furnished the report. We may also request subsequent consumer (credit) reports for all legitimate purposes in connection with updating, renewing, reviewing, modifying, and/or taking collection action on your account(s).\nReporting information to consumer reporting agencies and check verifications systems: We may report information about your account to consumer reporting agencies and/or check verification systems for the Adult on the account. Defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. This could affect your ability to open accounts in the future. In the event we report your account to a check verification system, you acknowledge that even if you pay us all amounts owed, we are not required to remove an accurate report of account mishandling from any such check verification system.\nConsumer Account:\nYour MONEY Teen Checking account is a consumer account and must be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If you fail to comply with these conditions, or use your account for business purposes, we may restrict use of, or close your account.\nAccount ownership: MONEY is a joint account owned by 2 people called \"joint tenants\" and all deposits made into the account are owned by both people. Except for certain retirement benefits like Social Security, if one person dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). Any adult owner of MONEY may, as allowed in this agreement: 1) withdraw, transfer funds or close the account without the other owner's consent; 2) pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us; or 3) deposit checks payable to any joint owner.\nIf one joint owner requests that we not pay items authorized by a different joint owner, we may restrict the account and refuse to pay all items (including items authorized by the owner making the request), but we are not required to do so. If we restrict the account, we may not release the restriction unless all joint owners agree in writing to remove it. No request to restrict the account will affect items that we paid before the request. If we decide not to restrict the account, all joint owners remain responsible for items subtracted from the account.\nJoint account with minor. This type of account is owned by one minor (under age 18) and one adult, and the owners of the account are called \"joint tenants.\" If the minor is 12 years of age or younger, then a parent or legal guardian must be a joint owner. Except for certain benefits like Social Security, if one account holder dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). Any owner of the account may transfer funds without the other owner's consent, but only the Adult account holder may withdraw funds to another bank. When the minor reaches 18 years old, certain changes will occur as disclosed throughout these terms, including the ability to send money using Zelle®. See \"Sending Money Using Zelle®\" for additional details.\n“Payable on Death” (POD): You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. Only an individual may be designated as a beneficiary. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nWe may also pay all or any part of the funds in the account to a court or government agency if we receive a garnishment, levy or similar legal process that identifies any of the joint owners.\nConnecting accounts: If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will automatically \"connect\" your eligible accounts so they appear when you're logged into your account through the website or mobile app.\nWe will display only summary information about your \"connected\" accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts and people with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nDeposits: This account allows you to make deposits by cash, check, Automated Clearing House (ACH), domestic wire transfer or other payment network transfers, or transfer from another eligible Capital One, N.A. deposit account.\nAny transaction that you conduct on Saturday, Sunday, a federal holiday, or other days on which we are closed may be handled the following business day.\nChecks you deposit must be payable to you or to the living trust (in the case of a trust account).\nWe may refuse all or part of a deposit. We also may refuse a deposit after initially accepting it. If we do that, we will reverse the amount added to your account and send it to you via check or your external linked account. We will not be liable to you for refusing a deposit, even if it causes us to decline any transactions you have already made.\nIf a check from a split deposit is returned unpaid, we’ll deduct the full amount of the check from the account that received the largest portion of the check. If the deposit was split for an equal amount, we’ll deduct the full amount of the check from the first account in the transaction sequence.\nOnce your account is open, funds will be available according to the Deposit Availability Disclosure section of this agreement.\nIf a check or other deposit is returned to us unpaid or is otherwise charged back to us, we will deduct the amount of the check/deposit from your account. If the check was deposited into MONEY and multiple other Capital One accounts, we will debit your MONEY account for the full amount.\nForeign checks are handled as collection items only and are converted at our current daily rate and credited in U.S. dollars. Foreign checks sent for collection are exchanged at the exchange rate on the day of payment. All returned foreign checks will be charged back to your account at the rate used when initially credited and may be subject to a foreign bank charge (if applicable). Please note that while the foreign check collection process typically takes anywhere from four to six weeks, we have no control over the process once a check is sent for foreign collection. Accordingly, the process may take longer, depending on the foreign bank. You hereby waive notice of dishonor, nonpayment, or protest with respect to any items credited to or charged against your account.\nIt's also simple to make withdrawals: You can request a withdrawal from your account by using our website, calling us, or visiting one of our branches.\nWithdrawals and transfers: Generally, you can withdraw or transfer money from your MONEY account by 1) using our website or mobile app; 2); using the Card we give to the Young Adult to make withdrawals at ATMs and points of sale (\"POS\"); 3) visiting one of our branch locations; or 4) calling us. We may limit, refuse or return any withdrawal or transfer of funds from your MONEY account that is made in a manner not permitted by us. You can't use checks to make a withdrawal from your MONEY account or transfer money to or from your MONEY account at a Capital One ATM terminal.\nFree transfers to or from your own linked account at another financial institution are processed via the automated clearing house (ACH) network, and will typically take 3-4 business days to transfer.

That's great because the Card can be used to (i) withdraw money at automated teller machines (\"ATMs\") that are part of a network we participate in; (ii) deposit cash or checks at a Capital One ATM that accepts Capital One deposits, and (iii) make POS purchases (including \"cash-back\" transactions where a merchant gives you cash from your MONEY account). You can't use your Card at an ATM to transfer money between your Capital One accounts or Linked Accounts. By using your Card, you authorize us and/or our agents to debit your MONEY account. You're responsible for all transactions you authorize using the Card, including any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result. Other than cross-border transactions, we don't charge you for using your Card. But, if you use your Card at an ATM, the owner of the ATM may charge you for using the ATM. If there is such a charge, you should be told how much it is before you complete the withdrawal. If you then decide to withdraw the money, the amount of the withdrawal, plus the charge, will be deducted from your MONEY account. The Card is the property of Capital One and if your MONEY account is closed or your Card privileges are canceled, you agree to stop using the Card and destroy it.\nTransactions made with your Card in foreign currencies and transactions that are classified by MasterCard® as \"cross-border transactions\" (generally, transactions that are processed outside the United States) are called \"foreign transactions.\" If a foreign transaction is in a foreign currency, it will be posted to your account in U.S. Dollars. The exchange rate between the foreign currency and U.S. Dollars is a rate selected by MasterCard®. Basically, here's how MasterCard® calculates the exchange rate: they usually start with either a government-mandated currency rate or a wholesale rate as of the day your foreign transaction is processed (i.e., not the date you made your purchase and not the date your purchase is posted on your statement).\nSending Money Using Zelle®\nThe Zelle® feature on the MONEY account is available for Young Adults 13 and older within the mobile experience. Customers ages 13 to 17 will need an adult’s consent to access Zelle®. The feature will not show in the mobile experience if the Young Adult is not yet eligible and will not be available for any Young Adult until the Adult has consented on their behalf.\nWhile the Young Adult is a minor under 18, the Adult is responsible for any transactions the Young Adult conducts using Zelle®. Payments that have not yet been processed via Zelle® may be canceled. Once a payment is sent, it cannot be canceled or reversed. Once permission to use Zelle® has been granted by the Adult, the Young Adult (once registered) can send money using Zelle®. Parents can grant or revoke Zelle® access for their Young Adult under 18 years old from the Parental Controls within the Capital One mobile app. If the Zelle® service is revoked, and the Young Adult is unenrolled from Zelle®, any pending transfers will be canceled. If access is once again granted to the Young Adult, they will be required to re-enroll with Zelle® to use this feature.\nZelle® usage details\nAdult’s rights when using Zelle®: \nCan grant the Young Adult permission to use Zelle® and is responsible for any transactions the Young Adult conducts using Zelle®.\nMust consent to Zelle® Terms & Conditions on behalf of the Young Adult.\nCan revoke permission to use Zelle® by unenrolling the Young Adult from the Zelle® network.\nCan lower the $500 per day limit for money sent using Zelle®.\nCan see the current Zelle® enrollment status and limits via the Adult mobile experience.\nYoung Adult’s rights when using Zelle®: \nMust be 13 or older\nCannot access or use Zelle® without Adult's permission.\nIf there are updates to the terms of the Zelle® service, the Young Adult will not be able to use the feature until the Adult re-consents to the updated terms.\nThe Young Adult can enroll and manage their contact points with Zelle®\nCan send up to $500 per day via Zelle® unless this limit is lowered by the Adult.\nCannot use the feature if the Adult revokes permission.\nWhat Changes When the Young Adult Reaches Age 18 \nBy continuing to use Zelle®, the Young Adult consents to the Zelle® terms and conditions\nIf the Young Adult is not already a registered user of Zelle® prior to reaching 18, the Young Adult will need to consent to Zelle® terms and conditions in order to enroll and use Zelle®\nWhen turning 18, Zelle® limits set by the Adult will remain; however, the Adult will no longer be able to toggle off the Young Adult’s access to Zelle®.\nAll owners on the account are responsible for authorized transactions conducted using Zelle®.\nFor your protection and our protection: You authorize us to follow any instructions you give to us. We reserve the right to contact you to obtain confirmation of any instruction before processing it. However, we're not required to confirm any instruction that looks like it was made by you, and we won't be liable if we don't contact you. We're also not required to confirm the actual identity or authority of anyone who uses your Password or a personal identification number (\"PIN\") or any account access device we gave you (like the Card) (collectively, \"E-Identification\"). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion and without notice, to refuse to make a withdrawal or transfer for security, credit, legal/regulatory or other reasons, and to refuse to honor withdrawal or transfer requests that appear to be fraudulent or erroneous. We can limit, refuse or return any withdrawal or transfer of funds from your account that is made in a way not permitted by us.\nStatements: As required by law, we‘ll provide you with a statement at least 4 times a year. Your Statement will be made available to you based on your selected delivery method. Payments or transfers you make will be listed on your Statement. You agree to notify us within 60 days if you think there‘s an error or unauthorized transaction shown on your Statement.\nOverdrafts: If your Available Balance isn't enough to cover any withdrawal or transfer you've authorized, you agree that we can refuse to process the withdrawal/transfer. If for some reason we allow your MONEY to be overdrawn, you must immediately make a deposit to cover the excess overdraft. If you don't promptly make a deposit to cover the overdraft, you agree that we can transfer funds from any other deposit account you have with us to cover the overdraft. If we sue you to collect any overdraft, you agree that we're entitled to collect all costs and expenses of suit from you (including the reasonable cost of an attorney), in accordance with applicable law. You agree that we aren't liable for any damages or expenses you incur due to any delay or failure of any Payee or third party in crediting or processing a withdrawal or transfer.\nWhat gets processed when: “Send Money With Zelle®”, the funds will be removed as soon as the payment is confirmed as successful. At midnight of each bank business day, we'll first process electronic fund transfers scheduled for that bank business day. If there aren't enough funds in your MONEY to allow all of the scheduled transactions for a bank business day to be completed, we'll process your scheduled electronic fund transfers from highest dollar amount to lowest dollar amount. We'll attempt every scheduled payment until your Available Balance is insufficient to cover a transfer.\nYour responsibility: You're responsible for all transactions you authorize, including any transactions you unintentionally or inadvertently authorize, and any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result. You must follow all of our instructions when you request and authorize any MONEY features. You must have sufficient available funds in your MONEY account to cover any withdrawal or transfer you request. If you authorize someone else to use your MONEY account or Card, you're responsible for everything that person does with your account, including any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result.\nYou’re also responsible for giving us accurate Payee information. If any Payee information changes after you initiate a transfer or payment, you’re responsible for notifying us of these changes. If you tell us to make a payment to a particular Payee and you fail to give us the correct information, we’re not responsible or liable for the payment.\nYou agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the bank and any of our third party providers who perform money related services for you on our behalf from any and all claims and liability arising from any payments initiated by you that aren’t completed due to lack of funds in your account(s).\nUnder no circumstances will we or our third party providers be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of your use of the money features, regardless of the nature of the claim, including negligence, even if we or our third-party providers know that such damages may occur. Money features are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\nOur responsibility: If we don't complete a payment or transfer on time, according to your properly transmitted instructions, we may be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, we won't be liable for losses and damages if:\nyou don't have enough available funds in your MONEY account to complete a withdrawal or transfer, if your checking has been closed, frozen, or isn't in good standing, or if we reverse a payment or transfer because of insufficient funds;\nyou haven't properly followed our instructions;\nPayee or account information you give us is incorrect;\nyou don’t authorize a payment or transfer soon enough for it to reach the Payee by its due date;\nyou receive notice from a Payee that any payment or transfer you made remains unpaid or hasn’t been completed, and you don’t notify us promptly;\nwithdrawals from any of your accounts have been prohibited by a Court Order or other legal process;\nyour computer, software, any Internet service provider, or our interactive website or mobile app wasn't working properly and this problem should have been apparent to you when you tried to authorize a transfer or payment;\nyou, or anyone you allow to use your MONEY account, commits fraud or violates any law or regulation; or\ncircumstances beyond our control prevent a withdrawal or transfer from being made.\nYour MONEY Agreement and other agreements you may have with us contain other exceptions to the Bank’s liability. You agree that we don’t have any responsibility or liability for any act or omission beyond that which is imposed on us by law.\nCollection of items: If we elect to receive checks and other items for collection, we act as your collection agent and don't assume any responsibility beyond the exercise of due care. We won't be liable for any default or negligence by any other banks we use to collect the check or item or for any loss in transit.\nThings you tell us to do: We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes: You must notify us of any change of address by calling us, or using our secure website. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you've told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (\"USPS\") or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.\nCommunication: You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us), and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nWhile we may be able to provide some customer assistance in languages other than English, we cannot guarantee that customer service will always be available in languages other than English. As a courtesy, we may translate some of our forms, letters and disclosures, including this agreement, into another language. However, many important bank documents, and some products and services related to this account, are provided only in English.\nMonitoring and closing your account: We reserve the right to monitor all MONEY activity for inappropriate use. Either you or we may close your MONEY at any time and for any reason. If we disable your MONEY with or without advance notice, all collected funds (less any amounts due to us) will be transferred to your external Linked Account, mailed as a check to the address we have in our records, or credited to another account you have with us.\nState laws (called \"escheat\" or unclaimed property laws) require us to close all your deposit accounts and transfer your money to the state if your accounts are dormant for a period of time, as defined by your state of residence. Your account can become dormant if, for 24 months, there is no transactional activity. Your account will remain dormant until funds are transferred to or from the dormant account. If all of your accounts become dormant, you may no longer receive paper statements, but you can still view your accounts online.\nState abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable state. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products are subject to abandoned property laws, including IRAs and CDs. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. We want you to keep your money, not the state! You can avoid the transfer of your money to the state simply by signing into your account, transacting periodically, contacting us, or replying to any abandoned property correspondence.\nThe Add Cash In Store Service\nAdd Cash In Store (“ACIS”) allows you to initiate through your agent, InComm Financial Services, Inc. (\"InComm\") and its agents, a transfer of funds to your ACCOUNT using the VANILLADIRECT service provided by InComm. There is no additional charge to you for using ACIS, but message and data rates could apply from your mobile service provider.\nWhen you use ACIS, you are asking InComm to transfer your funds to us on your behalf as your money transmitter agent as instructed by you. Following the TRANSMISSION from InComm to us, we will then credit the funds to your ACCOUNT.\nYou agree that we can share information about you, including information you provide to us when you use ACIS, with InComm and RETAILERS for purposes of performing the ACIS, as well as for resolving any errors, disputes or other processing issues. In addition, you are asking us to provide InComm with any updates to the information that you may later provide to us for InComm's use in accordance with InComm's privacy policy.\nInComm and the RETAILERS are not affiliated with us and are not agents or branches of Capital One, N.A. We do not provide, endorse or guarantee any third-party service, information or recommendation, including any information or recommendation offered by InComm or the RETAILERS.

You agree to the terms of this AGREEMENT when you enroll and each time you use the ACIS. Not all ACCOUNTS are eligible for the ACIS.\nThe meanings of capitalized terms appear in the Glossary Section at the end of this AGREEMENT. To make the AGREEMENT easier to understand, we also use the following personal pronouns:\n\"You\" and \"your\" means the person or persons that use the ACIS and any joint or other authorized ACCOUNT holder or authorized party on the ACCOUNT and their successors and assignees. All persons that are ACCOUNT holders or authorized parties on the ACCOUNT are responsible for authorized transactions conducted using the ACIS.\n\"We,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" means Capital One, N.A. and its agents, processors, affiliates, representatives, successors, and assignees.\nLimitations of the Service\nThe ACIS can only be used for TRANSMISSIONS to us. Also, you can only have one TRANSMISSION pending at a time. After that TRANSMISSION is either completed with InComm or expires as described below, you can then prepare another TRANSMISSION.\nAll Account holders on eligible Accounts will have access to Add Cash In Store. The Account is subject to transaction, daily, and monthly limits on the dollar amount of transfers using this feature. We can modify these limits at any time at our option. We do not disclose certain limits if we believe the confidentiality of the limits is essential to maintain the security of your ACCOUNT or the ACIS. All Account holders will be made aware of the limits when they engage with the ACIS to Add Cash In Store.\nRETAILER participation for this ACIS will be limited. The ACIS has a map listing the participating RETAILERS and their locations. Please check availability and locations prior to preparing a fund transfer.

You will need to visit the RETAILER and perform your prepared fund transfer before the barcode expires. Upon the expiration of the barcode, your prepared fund transfer will expire and the RETAILER will not be able to complete it. (If this happens, you will have to prepare a new fund transfer).\nThe RETAILER will scan the barcode and will, in its sole discretion, accept or reject the cash from you. The RETAILER may require certain types of documentation to verify your identity when you use the ACIS, depending on the transaction amount. The amount that could prompt a RETAILER to request documentation to verify your identity may be confidential for security purposes. Please note that Capital One will not record or maintain an image of such documentation when you use the ACIS.\nThe RETAILER will give you a receipt that matches the Transmission that you set up on the ADD CASH IN STORE WIDGET and matches the amount of cash that you gave to the RETAILER.\nAlways make sure to get a receipt from the RETAILER that matches the Transmission you just made in case there is a problem.\nAvailability of Fund Transfers using the Service\nFund transfers made using the ACIS will be credited to your ACCOUNT as soon as we receive the TRANSMISSION from InComm. Once credited, these funds will be available immediately for withdrawal, including through ATM withdrawals or payments through checks.\nError Resolution or Disputes\nIn the event that you or we discover a processing or TRANSMISSION error, we will help rectify the error regardless of whether it favored you or us.

We will then attempt to process and collect these deposited Images for payment.\nYour agreement with us\nThis Agreement contains the terms for our RDCS. You agree to the terms of this Agreement when you enroll and each time you use the RDCS. Not all Accounts are eligible for the RDCS.\nThe meanings of the terms you see in italics appear in the Glossary section at the end of this Agreement. To make the Agreement easier to understand, we also use the following personal pronouns:\n\"You\" and \"your\" means the person, persons or Business that use or receive the RDCS and any joint or other authorized Account holder or authorized party on the Account and their successors and assignees.\n\"We,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" means Capital One, N.A. and its agents, processors, affiliates, representatives, successors, and assignees.\nThe terms of this Agreement are in addition to the other agreements, terms, conditions, disclosures, software and fee schedules you have from us related to your Account including those for our mobile banking and online banking services. If there is a disagreement between the terms in this Agreement and those in other agreements related to the RDCS, this Agreement will control.\nBusiness customers\nEach Business that we allow to use the RDCS must be organized, licensed and authorized to do business in the U.S. as the law requires. Each Business permitted to use the RDCS will only allow Business Representatives to use the RDCS in connection with any Account owned by the Business.\nImage transmission, processing and payment\nAll Images you Transmit to us using the RDCS must be legible and meet our Program requirements including hardware and software requirements such as required Mobile Devices, operating systems and camera specifications. All required hardware and software will be at your expense.\nThe information you Transmit to us must meet the requirements to create a Substitute Check (including all MICR-line information) and contain the correct amount of the Eligible Item. Also, each Image must meet the technical requirements of an “electronic item” under Regulation J and Federal Reserve Operating Circulars. Additional requirements will be included in the Program.\nWhen you Transmit an Image to us, you agree that the Image is an “item” as defined by the UCC and is the legal equivalent of the Eligible Item for all purposes including our qualifying as a holder-in-due-course for it as described by the UCC.\nWe can attempt to process, collect, present for payment, return or re-present your Images in any way we choose that is allowed. This includes as Images under private agreement or clearinghouse rules, as automated clearinghouse entries (ACH) under the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA) rules, through a Federal Reserve payment service under Regulation J and Federal Reserve Operating Circulars, or as Substitute Checks.\nWe can reject any Image for any reason at our option and without liability, even where we have provided you with a confirmation notice. If your image is rejected, it will not appear in your Upcoming or Past/Recent Transactions. You will need to try again and redeposit the image. Do not destroy your check until you see the full deposit amount posted in your Recent Transactions.\nIf an Image does not meet our Program processing requirements, we can also at our option: (1) process the Image as received for payment; (2) correct the Image or its accompanying data and process the corrected Image for payment; (3) process the deposit for payment in another format as allowed; or (4) debit (chargeback) your Account for the amount of the Image. If you request a copy of the charged back image, we can return it to you in any way we choose including as an image along with its accompanying data or as a Substitute Check.\nWhen you successfully Transmit an Image to us, it will appear in your Upcoming/Recent Transactions. This does not mean that your Transmission and deposit are complete. All of your Images are subject to our further verification prior to being accepted for deposit and final payment after deposit.

We do not need to tell you if we believe a transaction limit is necessary to maintain or restore the security of an Account, the RDCS or the Program.\nYour handling of the original eligible item\nWhen you Transmit an Image to us, you will still have possession of the original Eligible Item. In order to further prevent an additional submission of the original Eligible Item for payment, you will take the following steps: (1) before you Transmit an Image to us, you will endorse (write your signature or Business name and signature if you are a Business) on the back of the original Eligible Item followed by the words “for Capital One mobile deposit” or as we otherwise tell you; (2) you will keep the original Eligible Item in a safe place until you see in it your Past/Recent Transactions; and (3) after you see the deposit in your account’s Past/Recent Transactions, you will destroy the original Eligible Item by shredding it or cutting it up.\nAvailability of your deposits using the services\nEligible Items deposited using the RDCS are not subject to the funds availability requirements of Regulation CC or our Availability Schedule. This will be true even if we provide you with Regulation CC disclosures or notices. For deposits made using the RDCS, we will still generally follow the Availability Schedule for the Account.\nAfter you Transmit an Image to us, we can place an extended hold on your deposited funds as described in our Availability Schedule. If we do, we will contact you to let you know when you can expect your funds to be available for withdrawal. You agree that we can include deposits made using the RDCS in deciding to place large deposit extended holds as described in our Availability Schedule.\nCutoff times for deposits using the service\nIf you successfully Transmit an Image to us before the cutoff time of 9 PM EST for the Account on a Business Day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. After that time or on a day we are not open, we will consider the deposit to be made on the next Business Day that we are open.\nNotices\nIn addition to notices we send to your Mobile Device, we may also send you notices about the RDCS in other ways the law allows including by automated (autodialed) text message, e-mail, regular mail, or website postings.

This is true even if you have made withdrawals against it. We can also charge fees connected to the chargeback as described in your fee schedule and other agreements with us.\nSecurity\nYou are responsible for protecting your Mobile Device against unauthorized use as well as any losses and damages from unauthorized access.

  "text": "\"Send Money with Zelle\" feature\nYou can use your account’s \"Send Money with Zelle\" feature to authorize a person-to-person payment to other people (like your friends, babysitter, or neighbor), including folks who have accounts at Capital One. The transfer limitations are described in the \"Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosure Statement\" section of this disclosure. You cannot use your Overdraft Line of Credit for \"Send Money with Zelle\" transactions.\nCheckbooks\nOur \"Checkbooks\" Feature allows you to order a checkbook so you can write physical checks. Each customer's first 50 quantity checkbook is free. Fees vary on subsequent orders including checkbooks for additional accounts. We may change the amount of the charge at any time. Also, if you write a check in an amount that exceeds your Available Balance plus any available Overdraft Protection amount at the time the check is presented to us for payment, we‘ll return the check. Customers cannot receive checkbooks at U.S. Territory or International addresses.\nSend an outgoing domestic wire feature\nWe may offer a \"Send an Outgoing Domestic Wire\" feature and allow you to make a wire transfer from your account. We will charge you a fee for using this feature, and the charge will be deducted from the checking account you use for the wire at the same time we deduct the amount of the wire. We may also limit the amount you can send and where we will allow you to send the wire.\nOverdrafts – An overdraft is when withdrawals are made against your account for an amount in excess of your available balance. Please see the Overdraft Services section of this agreement for additional information about overdrafts and our programs.\nIf your available balance isn't enough to cover any payment or withdrawal you've authorized (including any applicable charges), you agree that we can either overdraw your checking account, allow an advance from your Overdraft Line of Credit (360 Checking only), initiate a transfer from your linked Free Savings Transfer account, or we can refuse to process the payment/withdrawal. If for some reason we allow your checking account to be overdrawn, you must immediately make a deposit to cover the negative balance. This can happen if a transaction takes your checking balance negative or (if applicable) a transaction exceeds your available overdraft protection amount.\nIf we sue you to collect any overdraft, you agree that we're entitled to collect all costs and expenses of suit from you (including the reasonable cost of an attorney), in accordance with applicable law. You agree that we aren't liable for any damages or expenses you incur due to any delay or failure of the (i) courier (or the U.S. Postal Service) in delivering any check; and (ii) any Payee or third party in crediting or processing a payment or withdrawal.\nStopping/changing/cancelling payments – You may not stop, change, or cancel a cashier’s check after your request for a cashier’s check has been submitted to us. After a cashier’s check has been issued, you may not stop, change, or cancel it unless it has been lost, undelivered, destroyed, or was unauthorized. In this instance, you must notify Capital One immediately and, after presenting an Affidavit, the funds will be replenished on day 95 after the cashier’s check was ordered. If you return a cashier’s check to Capital One, it will be replenished upon receipt.\nFor stop payment requests made on checks written from your checkbook, we can’t guarantee that the check won’t be paid (for example, if the check is cashed before we’ve had an opportunity to act on your stop payment request).\nRefer to the Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosure Statement for information regarding electronic fund transfer stop payment requests.\nCancellation or amendment of funds transfer for outgoing wires\nOnce we receive a Funds Transfer Request, it may not be able to be canceled or amended. However, at our discretion, we may use reasonable efforts to act on any request for cancellation or amendment, provided that the method by which we are notified of a request for cancellation or amendment complies with our security procedures. However, we shall have no liability if such cancellation or amendment is not effected. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses we may incur in attempting to cancel or amend the Funds Transfer. Any cancellation or amendment of a Funds Transfer by us shall relieve us of any obligation to act on the original Funds Transfer Request.\n360 Checking card and multiple accounts – When you open your first 360 Checking account, we will automatically issue you a debit card. We will not issue additional debit cards for the additional 360 Checking accounts you open. If you open additional 360 Checking accounts, your debit card will still be attached to the account that it was attached to. If you would like, you can change your default spending account online or over the phone. The 360 Checking account that you choose as your default account will be the account for all ATM withdrawals and deposits as well as point of sale (POS) transactions.\nWhat gets processed when – \"Outgoing Domestic Wires,\" \"Send Money with Zelle\" transactions, and cashier's check will be processed as soon as possible after you enter them (and the funds will be removed from your account immediately). At midnight of each business day, we‘ll first process electronic fund transfers (other than \"Bill Pay\" instructions) scheduled for that business day. After all of those instructions have been processed, we‘ll then process all \"Bill Pay\" instructions scheduled for that business day.\nIf there aren‘t enough funds in your 360 Checking account to allow all of the scheduled transactions for a business day to be completed ... we‘ll process your scheduled electronic fund transfers (other than \"Bill Pay\" instructions) for that day first. We‘ll then process all scheduled \"Bill Pay\" instructions for that day from highest dollar amount to lowest dollar amount. We‘ll attempt every scheduled payment until we exhaust your available balance (including your Overdraft Line of Credit/Free Savings Transfer account). For example, if you schedule three Bill Pay transfers of $1,000, $500 and $250 for the same business day, but only have $1,250 available (including your Overdraft Line of Credit/ Free Savings Transfer account), we‘ll first pay the $1,000 transfer. Next, we‘ll attempt the $500 transfer. You won‘t have enough funds, so we‘ll refuse it. Finally, we‘ll attempt the $250 transfer. You do have funds to cover this payment, so we‘ll process it.\nYour responsibility – You're responsible for all transactions you authorize, including any transactions or payments you unintentionally or inadvertently authorize, and any losses, charges, or penalties incurred as a result. You must follow all of our instructions when you request and authorize any account features. You must have sufficient available funds in your account (which may include any available credit from one of our overdraft services that you have previously enrolled in) to cover any payment or transfer you request. If you authorize someone else to use your account or card, you're responsible for everything that person does with your account, including any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result.\nYou're also responsible for giving us accurate Payee information. If any Payee information changes after you initiate a transfer or payment, you're responsible for notifying us of these changes. If you tell us to make a payment to a particular Payee and you fail to give us the correct information, we're not responsible or liable for the payment.\nYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the bank and any of our third party providers who perform account related services for you on our behalf from any and all claims and liability arising from (i) your use or inability to use bill pay; and (ii) any payments initiated by you that aren't completed due to lack of funds in your account(s).\nUnder no circumstances will we or our third party providers be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of your use of the account features, regardless of the nature of the claim, including negligence, even if we or our third party providers know that such damages may occur. Bill Pay and other account features are provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\nOur responsibility – If we don't complete a payment or transfer on time, according to your properly transmitted instructions, we may be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, we won't be liable for losses and damages if:\nyou don't have enough available funds in your 360 Checking account (including any available amounts from one of our overdraft services that you have previously enrolled in) to complete a payment or transfer, if your checking account has been closed, frozen, or isn't in good standing, or if we reverse a payment or transfer because of insufficient funds;\nyou haven't properly followed our instructions;\nPayee or account information you give us is incorrect;\nyou don't authorize a payment or transfer soon enough for it to reach the Payee by its due date;\nyou receive notice from a Payee that any payment or transfer you made remains unpaid or hasn't been completed, and you don't notify us promptly;\nwithdrawals from any of your accounts have been prohibited by a court order or other legal process;\nyour computer, software, any Internet service provider, or our interactive website or mobile app wasn't working properly and this problem should have been apparent to you when you tried to authorize a transfer or payment;\nyou, or anyone you allow to use your 360 Checking account, commits fraud or violates any law or regulation;\ncircumstances beyond our control prevent a transfer or payment from being made.\nYour 360 Checking Agreement, Overdraft Line of Credit Agreement and other agreements you may have with us contain other exceptions to the Bank's liability. You agree that we don‘t have any responsibility or liability for any act or omission beyond that which is imposed on us by law.\nCollection of items – If we elect to receive checks and other items for collection, we act as your collection agent and don‘t assume any responsibility beyond the exercise of due care. We won‘t be liable for any default or negligence by any other banks we use to collect the check or item or for any loss in transit.\nThings you tell us to do – We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes – You must notify us of any change of address by calling us or using our secure website. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you‘ve told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (\"USPS\") or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.\nCommunication – You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us) and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nWhile we may be able to provide some customer assistance in languages other than English, we cannot guarantee that customer service will always be available in languages other than English. As a courtesy, we may translate some of our forms, letters and disclosures, including this agreement, into another language. However, many important bank documents, and some products and services related to this account, are provided only in English.\nMonitoring and closing your account – We reserve the right to monitor all 360 Checking and Overdraft Line of Credit activity for inappropriate use. We may close your 360 Checking at any time and for any reason. If we close your account, all collected funds (less any amounts due to us) will be transferred to your external Linked Account, mailed as a check to the address we have in our records, or credited to another account you have with us.\nYou may close your account at any time provided you don't have any outstanding balance on your Overdraft Line of Credit.\nState laws (called \"escheat\" or unclaimed property laws) require us to close all your deposit accounts and transfer your money to the state if your accounts are dormant for a period of time as defined by your state of residence. Your account can become dormant if, for 24 months, there is no transactional activity. Your account will remain dormant until funds are transferred to or from the dormant account. If all of your accounts become dormant, you may no longer receive paper statements, but you can still view your accounts online.\nState abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable state. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products are subject to abandoned property laws, including IRAs and CDs. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. We want you to keep your money, not the state! You can avoid the transfer of your money to the state simply by signing into your account, transacting periodically, contacting us, or replying to any abandoned property correspondence.\nAdditional disclosures\nLien and Set-Off – We have a continuing lien on, and under the Agreement you grant us a consensual security interest in, all of your deposits as security for any and all debts or obligations you owe us as borrower or otherwise, whether due or to become due. We may at our option, at any time and without notice to you, use all or any part of the money from your account (\"set-off\") to pay any debt you owe to us or to any of our affiliates of whatever kind and however arising. This right of set-off doesn‘t apply to your accounts to the extent restricted or prohibited by law or contract.\nChange/waiver of terms – We may change the Agreement, add new provisions and/or delete provisions at any time. Changes and new provisions will be binding upon you and your account as of their effective date. If we do make a change, we‘ll let you know about it as required by law. We may change the Agreement without notice to you when necessary to conform to federal or state law.\nWe reserve the right to terminate, change, discontinue or add products, functionality, account types or features at any time and within our sole discretion. We have the right to waive any of our rights under the Agreement with respect to any transaction without obligating ourselves to treat future transactions in the same way.\nNo fiduciary obligation – Capital One doesn‘t assume any fiduciary obligation on your behalf. This means that we don‘t act as your trustee or financial advisor, and we don‘t assume any responsibility for your 360 Checking or Overdraft Line of Credit beyond reasonable care.\nAssignment - You can‘t pledge, assign, give as a gift, or otherwise transfer the ownership of all or any part of your 360 Checking or Overdraft Line of Credit to a third party without our prior written consent.\nGoverning law and regulations – Your account is subject to both federal law and the laws of the state of Virginia, as well as any operating circulars or clearing house rules that apply to us and the rules and regulations of our supervisory authorities (collectively, \"Applicable Law\"). If there's a conflict between this Agreement and Applicable Law, the Agreement will be changed to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Law. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court or administrative agency having proper jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, that determination will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.\nLevies, attachments, and other court processes – If we receive a levy, attachment, or other legal process against you or any party to your account, we may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your checking account until the legal process is dismissed or satisfied. Any levy, attachment, or other legal process will be subject to our right of set-off and security interest. You're responsible for any losses, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your account.\nClaims against your account – If we receive a claim against the funds in your account, or if we know of or believe that there's a dispute as to the ownership or control of funds in your checking account, we may, in our discretion: (i) place a hold on your account and refuse to pay out any funds until we're satisfied that the dispute is settled; (ii) close your account and send the balance to the named account holder(s); (iii) require a court order to act; or (iv) take any other action we feel is necessary to protect us. We won't be liable to you for taking any such action.\nClaim of loss – If you claim a credit or refund because of a forgery, alteration, or any other unauthorized withdrawal, you agree to cooperate with us in the investigation of the loss. Your cooperation may include, but not be limited to, providing us with an affidavit containing whatever reasonable information we require concerning your account, the transaction, and the circumstances surrounding the loss.\nDeath, incapacity or termination – If you die or are declared legally incompetent, or, in the case of a living trust account, the living trust is terminated, we can continue to accept deposits and collect items deposited to your account, as well as continue to accept transaction instructions for your account until we know of your death or adjudication of incompetency and have a reasonable opportunity to act.\nNotices to you or us – We shall deem any and all notices to us effective upon receipt by us. Any notice that we give to you will be effective when mailed or electronically transmitted to you at the mailing/email address reflected in our records. Even though we may have provided you account opening disclosures in a language other than English, we may continue to provide you with notices/communications in English. Notice to any one owner of an account constitutes notice to all owners of that account.\nCaptions – The captions used in the Agreement are for convenience only. They don‘t affect the meaning of anything in the Agreement.\nJury trial waiver – All actions arising out of this agreement or concerning your Checking Account shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury.\nEvents beyond our control – We'll make all reasonable efforts to give you access to your accounts and current and complete account information. However, you agree that we won't be responsible for any interruption in service or loss caused by an event that is beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, wars, riots, strikes, computer failure, terrorist act or loss of power, communication, or transportation facilities. We also won't be responsible for any losses or damages, including direct damages, resulting from your use of your account, unless such losses or damages are caused by our lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care. In no event will we be responsible for indirect, special, or consequential losses or damages of any kind.",

  "text": "Consumer account:\nYour Kids Savings Account is a consumer account and must be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If you fail to comply with these conditions, or use your account for business purposes, we may restrict use of, or close your account.\nTypes of account ownership:\nIndividual account. This type of account is owned by one person.\nJoint account. This type of account is owned by two people. Except for certain retirement benefits like Social Security, if one person dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). The owners of the account are considered to be \"joint tenants\" with right of survivorship. Any owner of the account may: (i) withdraw, transfer funds or close the account without the other owner's consent; (ii) pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us; and (iii) deposit checks payable to any joint owner.\nIf one joint owner requests that we not pay items authorized by a different joint owner, we may restrict the account and refuse to pay all items (including items authorized by the owner making the request), but we are not required to do so. If we restrict the account, we may not release the restriction unless all joint owners agree in writing to remove it. No request to restrict the account will affect items that we paid before the request. If we decide not to restrict the account, all joint owners remain responsible for items subtracted from the account.\nWe may also pay all or any part of the funds in the account to a court or government agency if we receive a garnishment, levy or similar legal process that identifies any of the joint owners.\nJoint account with minor. This type of account is owned by one minor (under age 18) and one adult, and the owners of the account are called \"joint tenants.\" If the minor is 12 years of age or younger, then a parent or legal guardian must be a joint owner. Except for certain benefits like Social Security, if one account holder dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person).\nWhen the minor reaches 18 years old, both account holders will become joint account owners and will have equal privileges in terms of transfers and closing the account.\n“Payable on Death” (POD). You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. Only an individual may be designated as a beneficiary. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nConnecting accounts: If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will automatically \"connect\" your eligible accounts so they appear when you're logged into your account through the website or mobile app.\nWe will display only summary information about your \"connected\" accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts and people with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nStatements: As required by law, we‘ll provide you with a statement at least 4 times a year. Your Statement will be made available to you based on your selected delivery method. Payments or transfers you make will be listed on your Statement. You agree to notify us within 60 days if you think there‘s an error or unauthorized transaction shown on your Statement.\nThings you tell us to do: We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes: You must notify us of any change of address by calling us, or using our secure website.

(This hardly ever happens but legally we have to say it!)\nAssignment: No part of an account may be pledged, assigned, given as a gift, or otherwise transferred to a third party without our prior written consent.\nHow we handle items you send us: We won't be liable for checks or other items (\"Checks\") that are lost in the mail or for any default or negligence by a bank we may use to collect your Checks. When you send us Checks to be deposited into your account, we act as your collection agent and assume no responsibility beyond the exercise of reasonable care.\nLien and Set-Off: Unless otherwise prohibited by law, by opening an account, you grant us a security interest (in other words, a \"Lien\") in your deposit accounts with us. That means that at any time and without notice to you, we can use all or any part of the money from your individual or joint accounts to pay any amounts you owe us or any of our affiliates from time to time.

  "text": "At its most basic level, a bank is a place to safely keep your money. But beyond the basics, banks usually offer a wide range of products and services designed to make managing your money a bit easier.\nFrom car loans to credit cards, there are plenty of banking services you may need at different stages of life. And with digital options, you can access many of them right from your phone or laptop. Below is a review of financial topics that may help you learn banking basics. There’s also a glossary of terms at the end.\nWhy should I put my money in a bank? \nKeeping large sums of money at home can be risky. Even though the odds may be small, there’s always the chance of loss, theft or even a natural disaster. When you deposit money in a bank that’s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), you’ll know that it’s protected up to allowable limits.\nDealing with cash for everyday expenses can be a bit cumbersome. Besides that, a bank account allows you to track your expenses in a single place, which can be helpful if you’re monitoring a budget or building a savings account. Paying bills online can also simplify the process (as opposed to buying stamps and mailing checks).\nAnother consideration? Interest. Cash hidden in the cookie jar or under the mattress can’t multiply. But an account that earns interest pays you just for keeping your money there. Rates of interest vary from bank to bank, and from account to account, so you may want to shop around before deciding where to stash your cash. Here’s more info on ways you can bank and services that are offered:\nWays to bank \nBranches\nA bank branch is a brick and mortar location where your banking can be done in person. You might pop into a branch for a roll of quarters or a cashier’s check you need right away. You may want to rent a safety deposit box to store valuables or important documents. Or maybe you just prefer talking to a banker in person when you have questions about how to choose the right products and services for your financial needs.\nOnline and mobile banking\nMany banks allow you to manage your money from a computer or smartphone—and lots of customers have embraced these options.\nSome online banking and mobile apps allow you to bank from almost anywhere on your own schedule. With 24/7 access, you can do everything from managing multiple accounts to paying bills to transferring money. For the banks offering mobile check deposit, simply snapping a photo of the front and back of a signed check will send the payment to the account you choose—no ATMs or extra trips involved.\nRound-the-clock access also helps some people stay organized. If balancing your checkbook on Sunday evenings suits you, no problem. As for staying ahead of your bills, most bank apps can text you a reminder that a bill is due or even alert you if your account dips below a certain dollar amount.\nConsumer and corporate banking\nWhat’s a consumer bank account? Just as you’d imagine, consumer banking refers to financial products geared toward everyday consumers. Also known as retail banking or personal banking, it’s the division of a bank that serves the general public.\nCorporate banking, on the other hand, refers to financial products that serve corporate customers. Also known as business banking, this division of a bank generally serves a wide range of clients, including small businesses, mid-sized businesses and large conglomerates that may have billions in sales and offices nationwide.\nCredit unions\nMany people wonder how a credit union differs from a retail bank. In general, credit unions offer the same services as a bank, such as checking accounts and personal loans. But unlike a for-profit bank, a credit union operates as a cooperative and is owned by its members.\nSo how do you become a member? You’ll likely have to be a member of a group to use a credit union and its services, but this is easier than it sounds. Some credit unions simply require you to live in a certain town or city. Some cater to employees who work at the same company. And others affiliate with churches or schools. You may also be able to join if a relative is already a member.\nOne thing to keep in mind about credit unions is that they may be smaller than many banks. So there may be fewer locations, ATMs, credit card options and credit card rewards programs.1\nThe FDIC does not insure credit unions, however, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) offers the same type of protection to federally chartered credit unions.\nOnline-only banking\nWhile most banks today offer online services, there are also banks that exist solely online. With lower operating expenses, those savings can often be passed along to customers in the form of lower monthly fees or higher interest rates on savings accounts.\nTelephone banking\nSome banks allow you the option of banking by phone. Simply call a phone number and speak to a bank employee to do things like check your balance, transfer money, pay bills or handle other banking needs. If you call outside of your bank’s regular business hours, you may have to use an automated system that will take you through the steps necessary to complete your transactions.\nBanking products and services \nChecking account\nWhen you’re thinking about what services banks provide, a checking account may be the first thing you think of. This popular type of account allows you to store and manage the money you use for everyday spending. Once set up, you can use a debit card or check, which will take money directly from your account, to pay for everything from groceries to gas to bills. You can also get cash from an ATM or branch using your debit card and PIN, a unique password you choose to protect your account.\nSavings account\nA savings account can help you separate the money you want to save from the money you need to spend. For many, it’s an easier way to work toward a goal, like saving for home improvements or building an emergency fund. Most savings accounts can automatically move money from your checking account into your savings account each month, so you don’t even have to think about doing it yourself. An added bonus is that banks usually pay you interest on savings accounts. That’s free money that may help you reach your financial goals a little faster.\nMoney market account (MMA)\nAn MMA is a type of savings account that often pays higher rates of interest than a typical savings account. The more you put away, the more you may be able to earn. One thing to keep in mind? There may also be limits on how many withdrawals you can make each month.\nCertificate of deposit (CD)\nA CD is a type of bank account where you agree to keep your money in the account for a certain amount of time. The amount of time can vary, but terms often range from as little as 6 months to as long as 5 years.\nThe longer you save, the greater the return. You can always decide to withdraw your money early. However, there’s a penalty for withdrawal before the end of your CD term.\nDebit card\nWith a debit card, you can pay for everyday expenses with just a swipe (and usually your PIN). The money will come straight from your checking account so there’s no need to carry cash if you prefer not to. Plus, if your debit card is lost or stolen, you may not be responsible for unauthorized transactions if you report it in a timely manner. Lost cash, unfortunately, is often lost for good.\nCredit card\nA credit card lets you pay for items with a line of credit. In essence, you’re borrowing the money and then paying it back when the bill comes. But remember that different credit cards charge different rates of interest, so it’s important to know what you’re agreeing to (so you don’t end up paying too much in the long run). One way to avoid paying interest is to pay your bill in full each month. You may also want to watch out for annual fees, especially if it’s a card with perks such as airline miles or cash back. Shopping around for a credit card with no annual fees is always an option.\nFinance terms 101 \nATM\nAn automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic bank that allows you to complete basic transactions without a branch or teller. You’ll just need your debit card and secure PIN. Some ATMs also allow deposits of cash or checks. While you don’t need to use your bank’s ATM to access your cash, you might have to pay a fee to use others. Many credit cards allow cash withdrawals as well, but this “cash advance” can come with a hefty fee, so be sure to find out beforehand.2\nFDIC\nWhen your money is in a bank that’s backed by the FDIC, you’ll know it’s safe and secure up to allowable limits. That’s because the U.S. government protects FDIC-insured deposits in the very rare event that a bank fails.3 You can use its BankFind tool to see if your bank is a member and to look up the maximum limit of deposited funds that are insured.\nDeposit\nAnytime you put money into your account, you’re making a deposit. You can usually deposit checks or cash at a bank, ATM or even on your mobile phone. Direct deposit is when your paycheck is transferred to your checking or savings account by your employer automatically on payday, which can save you time.\nWithdrawal\nAnytime you take money out of your account, you’re making a withdrawal. Just like with deposits, you can take out funds at a bank branch or ATM. When you write a check, wire money or use your debit card, the money is withdrawn automatically from your account.\nFees\nWhen it comes to different types of banking products, fees can vary widely. But it’s also possible to find fee-free accounts and services that will likely suit your needs. Common fees for services rendered by some banks include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees and ATM fees. If you want to avoid paying extra, it can be worth shopping around and comparing offers.\nNow that you’re familiar with a few more financial terms, products and services, you may feel a bit more confident about managing your money. The more you know about what banks have to offer, the easier it may be to make a plan that works best for your lifestyle and personal financial goals.",

  "text": "FDIC stands for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It was formed in the 1930s in response to the banking crashes that accompanied the Great Depression. It’s designed to keep America confident in its banks, but it also provides real-world safeguards for your money by doing precisely what its name implies: insuring your bank deposits.1\nJust like you pay car insurance premiums, American banks pay premiums to the FDIC. The FDIC in turn uses that money, plus other federal funds, to repay customers if a bank fails. The agency insures most American banks, making it responsible for trillions of dollars in deposits. It also regulates those banks, monitoring their health in an effort to avoid collapse.1\nThe FDIC insures several categories of deposit accounts. That includes what the agency calls single accounts, which covers checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs).2 But investments like stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other equities are not covered.3\nThe FDIC also limits how much money can be insured in a given account, meaning there are limits to what you can be paid back in the unlikely event that your bank closes. By getting to know the FDIC limits and how they work, you'll have the know-how to make the system work for you.",

  "text": "August 7, 2024 |5 min read\nSimply put, a checking account is a bank account designed to be used for everyday expenses. Checking accounts keep your money safe until you need it. And then allow you easy access when the time comes.1 Plus, some even pay interest to help your money grow.2\nWhen you need to make a purchase, you can access your money using a debit card, a checkbook or online banking services. If you need cash, you can typically use an ATM or visit a local branch of your bank. Money to deposit? There are plenty of ways to do that too.2\nKeep reading to learn more about how checking accounts work.\nAdvantages of a checking account \nSo why should you open a checking account, and what do you use a checking account for? You can use a checking account to manage the money that you earn and spend. Being able to see how much comes in and goes out every month may help you keep better track of where your money is really going. Some common uses for checking accounts include:\nEveryday purchases\nIf you receive a debit card when you open your new checking account, it will come in the mail with instructions for selecting your PIN—that’s the “personal identification number” that will help safeguard your account.3 Once it’s set up, you can use your debit card to buy anything from groceries to gas to movie tickets. Just be sure to memorize your PIN, as you may be asked to enter it during a transaction.\nYou can also make online purchases with your debit card. You may be asked to enter information such as your name, address and debit card number along with its expiration date and the three-digit code on the back of your card. \nHowever you use your debit card, the money will come directly out of your checking account.4 Just remember to keep an eye on your balance so you can try to avoid spending more than you have (more on that in a moment).\nPostage-free payments\nOne popular feature of most checking accounts is the option to pay bills online with just a few clicks.5 From utilities to credit cards, bills can generally be paid from the comfort of your office, couch or car (once you’re safely in park). In the bill pay area of your bank’s website, you can enter information such as the company you’d like to pay and the account number on your bill. Your bank may be able to help if you need a little guidance. Once each account is set up, you’ll see all of your payees, and if the vendor offers it, your monthly bills, in one place—which can make them easier to keep track of and harder to forget. This can help you avoid late payments and potential fees.\nSome banks even allow you to sign up for text or email alerts to let you know when a bill is due, if your balance drops below a certain amount or when a deposit or withdrawal has been made.\nPrompt paychecks\nGoing to the bank or another check-cashing business every time you get paid can be a hassle, not to mention the delays you may experience on weekends and holidays.\nWith direct deposit, your employer puts your paycheck straight into your bank account for you.6 No check cashing or travel expenses. If you’re interested, ask your employer if they offer direct deposit and how to get started. It’s usually a matter of filling out a single form. Just have your bank account information handy.\nYou might even be able to divide your paycheck between several different accounts. You might put the bulk of your check into a checking account for easy access and everyday needs, while sending a smaller amount to a savings account. For some people, this is the easiest way to get in the habit of saving, because it’s done automatically.\nUsing your checking account \nLet’s get down to checking account basics. After you open your checking account, you may find it helpful to keep a running balance. This means documenting every withdrawal or deposit you make from your account so you can balance your checkbook. This can help you avoid overdrawing your account and getting hit with fees.\nHow do I choose the right checking account? \nSince people use money in different ways, there’s no right answer for everyone. But as you’re looking at what checking accounts different banks have to offer—either online or at a local branch—there are a few things to think about:2\nFind out how much money you’ll need to deposit to open your new checking account. Some banks require an initial deposit, while others let you open an account and add money later.\nSee if the bank charges monthly maintenance fees or overdraft fees. Avoiding these may keep more money in your wallet, and that’s a win. Fee-free checking accounts and ATMs do exist, as well as overdraft protection options, which can shield you from fees if you spend more than you have in your account (oops). \nYou can even look for checking accounts that pay interest—that’s money you can earn just by keeping money in the bank. While checking accounts usually earn less interest than savings accounts, it may be worth exploring because every penny counts.\nFinally, be sure that the bank you choose is FDIC-insured. That’s the gold standard in banking that ensures your money is protected from a bank failure up to allowable limits.7\nChecking Account vs Savings Account \nIf you’re thinking about opening a checking account, consider what you’re looking for in a bank account. If you want an account for everyday spending with easy access to your money, a checking account may be right for you. Most come with debit cards that can typically be used wherever credit cards are accepted.8\nSavings accounts, on the other hand, are typically used for money that you don’t plan on accessing frequently.1 Savings accounts may have a monthly withdrawal limit and don’t come with debit cards.9 However, they generally come with higher interest rates than checking accounts.2\nNow that the meaning of a checking account is more clear, you can decide whether this is the right place to stash your cash.",

  "text": "July 31, 2024 |6 min read\nLooking for a convenient place to keep your money in between use that’s not the pocket of your jeans that winds up in a wad after a tango with the washer?\nA checking account might be just what you’re looking for. It’s a bank account used for everyday deposits and withdrawals—that means putting money into your account, taking it out or using your debit card in the place of cash.1\nThere are many benefits of a checking account, from easy access to your cash to direct deposit of your paycheck. Like with anything, there are checking account pros and cons, but let’s start with the advantages.\nAdvantages of checking accounts \nIf you're considering opening a bank account, there are lots of advantages to having a checking account. \nEarn interest: Some checking accounts earn interest, which means your money can grow even when it’s just sitting in the account.2\nFDIC insurance: If you’ve been keeping your money in jars or under your mattress, you may be interested in the security of a checking account. Most checking accounts have FDIC insurance and are covered up to the allowable limits.3\nEasy access: Checking accounts let you access your money in a number of ways. You can typically spend or withdraw money by visiting a bank, using your debit card at an ATM, writing a check or making an online transfer.\nDebit card: Most checking accounts come with a debit card, so instead of paying with cash, you can easily tap or insert your card into a card reader at checkout to pay directly with the money in your account. You can also pay online with your debit card by filling out the requested information, like your name and card number.\nDirect deposit: You can set up direct deposit into your checking account right from your employer.4 No more risk of losing paper checks in the mail. Your paycheck can be deposited into your checking account automatically on payday, which might be faster than getting it via mail, too.\nGet paid early: Some banks even offer early direct deposit, where you can get your paycheck up to 2 days sooner—so you can pay bills earlier and buy the things you need.\nTrack spending: With a checking account, there is a record of your deposits and spending, so you can see where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Plus, some checking accounts let you lock your debit card if it's ever lost or stolen—helping to prevent unauthorized use.\nDisadvantages of checking accounts \nWhile checking accounts are full of benefits, they have a few shortcomings to be aware of, too. Keep in mind that checking accounts vary from bank to bank, so be sure to look into what features come with yours.\nNo interest: While some checking accounts earn interest, most don’t. And the checking accounts that do earn interest typically have a lower interest rate than savings accounts. This is because a checking account is typically used like cash and isn’t intended for your money to sit still, whereas a savings account is more typically used for long-term savings that won’t be touched as often.\nFees: Another checking account disadvantage is that sometimes checking accounts have monthly fees. That means paying money to use your own money. The good news is that there are some free checking accounts that don't have monthly fees, which means more of your money stays yours, so be sure to check when you're choosing your account.\nMinimums: Some banks require you to keep a minimum balance in your checking account at all times. If you don’t, there might be a fee you have to pay. But remember, not all checking accounts are created equal, so if you’re worried about maintaining a minimum balance, look for a checking account that doesn’t have one.\nDifferent types of checking accounts \nIf you’re tired of keeping track of cash (and tangoing with soggy dollars in the washing machine), a checking account might be the right choice for you. Check out these different types of checking accounts.\nTraditional checking accounts: A traditional checking account typically offers checks, a debit card and ATM access. There’s also usually a physical bank location. There may or may not be fees, so be sure to check.\nOnline checking accounts: Online checking accounts provide services digitally. That means they may not have any physical locations for you to go to, but it also means that you can bank from wherever you are, online or on your phone.\nJoint checking accounts: Joint checking accounts have more than one account holder who can access the cash. This can be a good solution for married couples or college students and their parents. Another thing to keep in mind: Adding a joint account holder could increase the amount of FDIC insurance for the account.\nTeen and kid checking accounts: Some banks offer checking accounts made specifically for teens and children.5 They might have extra budgeting features or safety features, like the ability to set up savings goals and transaction text alerts for parents, that make them ideal for a first step into managing finances. These accounts typically require a parent or guardian to be a joint account holder.\nBusiness checking accounts: If you run a business, this could be the checking account for you. Business checking accounts make it easier for you to keep your personal money separate from your business finances.\nMoving your money into a bank account is a lot to think about. And choosing the right bank account for your needs is a personal choice. Consider these checking account advantages and disadvantages, as well as the features you’re looking for in a new bank account. If you’re interested in easy access to your everyday cash, a checking account might be the way to go.\nRelated Content\nArticle | July 31, 2024 \nBanking Basics\nBanking 101\nArticle | July 3, 2024 \n|5 min read \nArticle | August 7, 2024 ",

  "text": "August 1, 2018 |5 min read\n“Budget” is a simple little word, but it can strike fear in almost anyone. It brings to mind complicated spreadsheets, mind-numbing math and—perhaps most irritating of all—lots of seemingly random spending restrictions.\nWait, though. When it’s done in a balanced way, budget planning can be quite freeing and can lower your stress level about money. A balanced monthly budget can do more than just help you get by. It can help you save money toward other exciting things, like vacations, holiday gifts and the big one—college tuition.\nBetter yet, a balanced budget is pretty easy to create.\nThe 50/20/30 budgeting strategy\nWith this minimalist guide on how to make a budget, just split your monthly income into 3 simple buckets, or budget percentages:\n50% for Needs\n20% for Savings\n30% for Wants\nThis balanced way of budgeting, often referred to as the “50/20/30” approach, was popularized by Harvard bankruptcy expert and now-Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi. Many financial experts—and lots of “regular people”—now use this method. Here’s how it works:\n1. First, determine your monthly income\nThis is the money you have available to spend, after taxes. In addition to that net monthly paycheck, income includes any money from other sources:\nMoney earned from a side job\nAlimony and/or child support\nInvestment income\nGovernment benefits\nAdd up all of money sources. This is your monthly income.\n2. Figure out a 50% “Needs” target\nThis Needs budget bucket includes required monthly expenses:\nRent or mortgage\nUtilities (water, garbage, electricity, gas, phone)\nInsurance (including home/renters, car and health)\nFood (groceries only; eating out goes into the “Wants” category)\nTransportation (including commuter passes, tolls and gas)\nClothing\nCalculate 50% Needs \nMultiply your monthly income by 0.50. For example, if your after-tax income is $3,000, your Needs budget is $1,500.\nMonthly income ($3,000) x 0.50 (50%) = $1,500 (target Needs budget)\nA good goal, then, would be to spend no more than $1,500 per month, or 50% of your available monthly budget, on required expenses.\nSpending more than 50% on Needs? Consider trimming some fixed costs. Why? Putting too much money into your Needs category could mean you run short of money for Savings and Wants. Get ideas for cutting costs on food, utilities, insurance or commuting.\n3. Determine your 20% “Savings” amount\nSavings are an important part of any balanced monthly budget. Having money in savings means you’re less likely to go into debt to afford a big-ticket item or pay for an unforeseen expense.\nKeep in mind that debt payments (other than a mortgage) are also included in the 20% savings percentage. Why? Simplicity. After paying off student loans, credit cards or car loan, you can redirect that same money into a savings account.\nHere’s what’s included in the Savings budget bucket:\nEmergency fund\nRetirement savings and investments\nCredit cards, student loans and other non-mortgage debt payments\nOther savings goals (vacation, wedding, home improvements)\nCalculate 20% Savings If your monthly, after-tax income is $3,000, your Savings budget is $600.\nMonthly income ($3,000) x 0.20 (20%) = $600 (target Savings budget)\nPutting less than 20% into Savings? Free up more money by trimming expenses in the Needs and Wants buckets. Get tips on saving money fast and building an emergency fund. Consider putting Savings money in an easy-access savings account.\n4. Figure out your 30% “Wants” target\nIt’s OK to budget for fun stuff? Absolutely! Leaving a little room in the family budget for enjoyable things can keep everyone from feeling deprived.\nThe Wants budget bucket includes expenses for all the “extras”:\nRestaurant food, from eating out to getting coffee from the corner café\nEntertainment, like downloading movies and music\nExercise, such as gym memberships or yoga classes\nAfter-school activities for kids, including travel sports\nCalculate 30% Wants Using an after-tax income of $3,000, your Wants budget is $900.\nMonthly income ($3,000) x 0.30 (30%) = $900 (target Wants budget)\nSpending more than 30% on Wants? It’s the same drill: Look for creative ways to cut costs. And if you spend less than 30% on Wants, go back and make sure the Needs and Savings buckets aren’t too big. Don’t shortchange yourself here. Putting money toward some Wants may make it easier to resist “budget fatigue” and throwing away the monthly budget altogether.\n5. Add it up: 50 + 20 + 30 = 100% balanced family budget\nThat’s it! This is the simple formula for how to make a budget you can live with.\nOf course, this isn’t the only way to create a family budget. However, the main advantage of the 50/20/30 approach is that it’s clear and straightforward. It might even convince the most stubborn anti-budgeters to give it a try. When that happens, “budget” can stop being a dirty word and start being one of your family’s most helpful everyday resources.",

  "text": "Since minors generally can’t open bank accounts by themselves, you’ll typically need to be a joint owner of the account, which may actually be a good thing. It’ll give you the chance to compare banks and find features that are important to both of you. You can discuss pros and cons, make compromises and even adopt some new habits on this financial journey you’re taking together.\nMaybe your teen wants a bank account that’s free of fees and doesn’t require a minimum balance because they’re just getting the hang of this money thing. That’s not too hard to find. But maybe you’re mostly interested in tracking their spending. An issue like that may be worth a discussion, so your child understands where you’re coming from.\nFor instance, there are joint teen checking accounts that allow you to receive alerts every time your child makes a transaction. But should you? When it comes to monitoring your kid’s checking account, privacy parameters will be up to you. Navigating these options together will keep the lines of communication open.\nWith banking apps, everything from money transfers to mobile deposits can be done in minutes. However, impulse purchases with the swipe of a debit card are just as quick. This can be an opportunity to talk about the difference between “wants” and “needs.” For most people, finding a balance takes time, and managing a bank account is one way to practice.\nA teen checking account can even earn a little interest. If your teenager earns money on their own, they may be able to grow their money with interest.\nTogether, you can compare rates on checking accounts, savings accounts and even longer-term investment options like CDs. It can be an eye-opening exercise to see how your dollars may grow, depending on where you leave them.",

  "text": "October 23, 2018 |6 min read\nYou’ve introduced your child to so much of the world already, but money seems to be a conversation many parents have trouble starting. However, studies have shown that when you talk to your kids about money, they are more likely to save and be financially secure in their lives.1\nTruth be told, most parents don’t feel qualified to teach their kids about money because they’ve made money mistakes themselves. But you don’t need to be a financial adviser to explain money to a child and offer basic advice. After all, you may not have won the Tour de France, but you can still teach your kids to ride a bike. By teaching them about saving and paying bills, you can hopefully help your children avoid financial troubles as an adult.\nFrom toddlers to teenagers, every age brings unique opportunities to teach your kids about money. And according to Jayne Pearl, author of several books about financial parenting, you just need to start. “If your kid is ready to have a conversation, you can try to have a conversation. If it bombs, you can try again in a few months or next year, but I think it’s never too early to try.”2\nIt all adds up\nChildren start counting at around age 3 so that’s when some parents start teaching their kids about money. They won’t understand everything, but at 4 or 5 you can help your children understand that different types of money have different values. Show them how a quarter is worth more than 10 pennies, and how to add these coins together. They may not get it right away, but the goal should be to help them develop a basic understanding and get more comfortable around money.\nShow me the money\nIn a world where swiping cards to pay is so common, children who see cash find it easier to assign value to it.1 If you make an effort to carry real currency around, your children will start recognizing the different values of each bill and coin, which will help them better understand the concept of exchange.\nEasy as 1-2-3\nEven adults can find budgeting difficult. But to help children budget their money, you can keep it simple. Try putting aside 3 jars labeled “Spending,” “Saving” and “Sharing.” Whenever money comes in, encourage them to split the money among the jars. Put 50% in “Spending” to use whenever they like, 40% in “Saving” to go toward a particular goal and 10% in “Sharing” for gifts or donations.\nA penny saved\nSaving for the sake of saving is not something many children will understand. Instead, help your kids create a savings goal. If they really want a video game, change the “Saving” jar to the video game title. You can even measure the progress with a growth chart and a red marker to help visualize their savings. By teaching kids to save money, they may feel encouraged to put away even more to reach their goal.\nA penny earned\nHaving your children earn an allowance by completing chores can help them understand that money isn’t free. No chores. No allowance. Even if it’s only $5 a week, having a source of income will give them a chance to start managing money at a young age. You could also have your children earn money for larger chores like Susan Borowski, mother and author for moneycrashers.com. “The amount [my 13-year-old] earns depends on the difficulty of the task or how long it takes, so we discuss money each time he takes on a larger task.”3 This can help your kids develop a strong work ethic and have an appreciation for earning their money.\nMake money mistakes\nConsider letting your children manage their own money. You can offer some guidance, but you should know that letting them make a $10 mistake—like spending all their money on a toy they only use once—could save them from making a $1,000 mistake later on in college.2 It’s never an easy lesson to learn, but it’s better they learn it when the stakes are lower.\nAlso talk to your kids about money mistakes you’ve made. In general terms, you can mention how you may have spent too much on something or didn’t have enough savings when you wanted it. Help them learn from your experiences.\nAll the way to the bank\nOnce your child is around 9 or 10, they could be ready to go to the bank and open a real savings account. Remind them of their “Saving” jar, and create an even greater goal for this account. Whether it’s college, a car or an emergency fund, by now they’ll have a stronger grasp on how their savings can grow over time.\nGet what you pay for\nWhen your children reach middle school, it’s a good time to have them start paying for more things you used to buy for them. According to Jean Chatzky, financial editor of The Today Show, you can “come up with a list of things you have paid for in the past that you know your kids want, that you’re no longer going to pay for. Make them allocate their resources…research shows kids that get an allowance understand that credit is not an unlimited resource in the future.”4\nNo need for “wants”\nA few years later, when your child becomes a teenager, they should have a decent grasp of value and saving. But as they test their boundaries and develop new interests, your guidance can help them avoid common pitfalls. Discuss “wants” versus “needs.”5 You may even consider sharing your own finances to illustrate family necessities like your bills, food and home.\nExplaining money to a child doesn’t have to be difficult. You might start teaching kids about money as young as 3, but even if your children are older and almost ready to go off on their own, it’s still not too late to open up a dialogue and teach your kids money management. Share your advice and mistakes while offering lessons they can take with them. Providing some financial literacy for your kids as they grow can help them make smart money decisions for the rest of their lives.",

  "text": "July 31, 2024 |4 min read\nIf you’re ready to open a checking account, you may already have some financial needs in mind—like setting up direct deposit, paying bills or getting a debit card.\nVirtually any checking account will provide these basic services. But if you want to find an account that really fits your needs and budget, there are a few other factors worth considering. Here’s a simple, 5-step guide to walk you through the process:\n1. Gather your identification documents \nWhat’s required to open a checking account is probably right at your fingertips. If you open it in person, you’ll likely need two forms of ID (such as a driver’s license, Social Security card, passport or birth certificate) and proof of address (by way of a utility bill, mortgage statement, lease or similar document).1\nBut if you’re like most people, you may be wondering “Can I open a checking account online?” The answer is yes. You’ll simply enter information such as your date of birth and ID numbers on the bank’s application page. If you’re applying for a joint account, you will likely both need to verify your identities. Under 18? Banks may allow you to get a checking account if a parent or legal guardian is willing to be co-owner of the account.\nThose are the basic requirements for most people to open a checking account. If you don’t drive, you can get an ID card from your local DMV. If you’re not a U.S. citizen, you may just need an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number and proof of your identity to open a checking account.2\nNow that you know what to bring or have on hand to open a checking account, it’s time to learn about fees or—better yet—how to avoid them.\n2. Explore low- or no-fee accounts \nSome banks charge monthly service fees, maintenance fees, low-balance fees and ATM fees. If you’d rather avoid these charges (who wouldn’t?), be sure to go with a truly “fee-free” checking account so there are no surprises.\nSome banks charge their checking account holders $12 a month (or more) if they don’t maintain a balance of $1,500 or satisfy other requirements.3 That’s $144 a year! By shopping around, you can steer clear of these fees and most additional costs.\nSome banks require a minimum deposit, usually between $25 and $100, when opening a new account.1 Again, if this doesn’t suit your needs, no problem. There are checking accounts that require nothing at all to get started.\n3. Find features that fit your lifestyle \nEveryone’s banking needs are a little different, so think about your lifestyle and what you need your checking account to handle. Need to pay bills online? Do you travel and need ATMs in lots of locations? Maybe you want to deposit paychecks with your phone on the go. All totally doable. Just keep a list of “must-haves” handy as you compare banks.\nOverdraft protection is another option to think about. Say you lose track of your balance and spend more than you have in your checking account. Lots of people have been there a time or two (or three), which can result in a penalty. Luckily, there are checking accounts that come with a range of overdraft protection options that can keep those fees at bay.\n4. Earn a little interest \nBesides avoiding fees, you could actually make a little money just for keeping your cash in a checking account that earns interest for you.\nEven if your balance will be fairly low, it’s worth choosing a checking account that pays interest because every dollar counts. And remember, cash hidden under a mattress or in dresser drawers will never have the chance to grow.\n5. Bank on the go \nToday, checking accounts can be as mobile as you are, with apps that can sign you in with the swipe of a finger (rather than a password), send you instant alerts or transfer money quickly and securely.\nOnce you open your checking account, you can fully explore its features. Just be sure to review any confirmation materials you receive and follow the instructions for setting up your debit card, using your bank’s online services and keeping your account safe.\nThere’s no doubt about it: Opening a bank account is faster and easier than ever. But ensuring that it’s affordable and really fits your needs is what matters in the long run. So, shop around and find a checking account that has the features you’re after. You’ll be glad you did.",

  "text": "Settling on the right child allowance amount depends on your family’s finances and other factors. One popular place to start is with $1 per week for every year old they are.3 So if you start when your child is 6, he or she would get $6 a week, then $7 and so on.\nThis gets trickier when kids start needing money for gas and prom dresses. So what is a reasonable allowance for high school students?\nOn average, teenagers with allowances get the same weekly rate as younger kids—around a dollar for every year old they are.4 But as life gets more expensive, you could try to adjust kids’ allowances to what they actually spend, rather than just pay for it yourself.\nFor example, if your teenager is spending hundreds of dollars a month on gas, food, clothes and cell phone data, you might consider giving them that money up front and seeing if they can stick to a budget. \n“Young adults learn financial skills more and benefit when they have opportunities to make their own financial decisions,” the CFPB says, adding that having you as a safety net can help them learn from experience—and mistakes.1",

  "text": "September 26, 2023 |5 min read\nAn overdraft happens when you spend more than you have in your bank account and the transaction goes through, resulting in a negative balance. Since you’re using money from your account—and not borrowing money like you would with credit—an overdraft doesn’t appear on your credit report. So it shouldn’t affect your credit scores.\nHowever, there could be negative effects on your credit scores if you don’t resolve the overdraft. And you may not be able to open a new bank account in the future. Learn more about how overdrafts work and when they might affect your credit. \nKey takeaways\nOverdrafts don’t usually affect your credit scores unless you don’t resolve them quickly and the account goes into collections.\nChecking accounts aren’t included in your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus, but they could be included in your ChexSystems report.\nIf your bank offers overdraft protection and you opt for it, that could mean linking your checking account to a savings account, credit card or line of credit to cover potential overdrafts. Or your bank may cover the transaction and charge an overdraft fee.\nCapital One eliminated all overdraft fees for its consumer banking customers, but it still provides overdraft options. If your bank doesn’t offer overdraft protection or you don’t opt into it, a transaction that would result in a negative balance could be declined.\nWhat is an overdraft and how does it work? \nIf you spend more than you have in your bank account and your financial institution approves the transaction, that’s considered an overdraft. Overdrafts can happen when you use your debit card, write a check, withdraw money from an ATM or automatically pay a bill, for example. \nSome banks charge overdraft fees, while others have reduced or eliminated them. For example, Capital One doesn’t charge overdraft fees.\nWhat is overdraft protection? \nBanks might offer overdraft protection that account holders can opt into. One overdraft protection option may be linking your checking account to a savings account, credit card or other line of credit. That way, funds can be transferred to your checking account to cover any overdrafts. These transfers might still result in a fee, but it’s typically less than an overdraft fee. Another option is the bank could cover any overdrawn transactions, then charge you the overdrawn amount plus an overdraft fee. \nCapital One account holders can opt in for overdraft protection any time and choose their overdraft preference. If customers aren’t enrolled, transactions that would result in a negative balance are declined, and no fees are charged.\nHow overdrafts could affect your credit \nYour credit scores reflect information in your credit reports. Because checking accounts aren’t a type of credit, they don’t appear in your credit reports or affect your credit scores, and neither do overdrafts. \nHowever, if you don’t resolve your overdraft and the account goes into collections, that could affect your credit scores. That’s because the collection agency may report that information to the major credit bureaus.\nWhat is ChexSystems? \nWhile overdrafts won’t generally show up in credit reports from the major credit bureaus, they could show up in a ChexSystems report. ChexSystems is a consumer reporting agency that collects and reports information about deposit accounts, including checking and savings accounts. \nA ChexSystems report may include activities like:\nOverdrafts and bounced checks\nAccount openings and closings\nAccount applications\nSuspected identity theft\nYour ChexSystems report won’t usually affect your credit scores. But it could impact your ability to open new checking or savings accounts. That’s because financial institutions may check your ChexSystems report when they’re reviewing your application. So if you’re interested in opening a new account, it’s a good idea to know if you have an overdraft in your ChexSystems report.\nOverdrafts and credit FAQ \nHere are some of the common questions about overdrafts and credit:\nCan you overdraft a credit card?\nAn overdraft has to do with a bank account, not a credit card. But as part of overdraft protection, you may be able to link a credit card to your bank account to cover any transactions that go over your account balance. \nCredit cards typically have a credit limit. If you try to go over it, your card could either be declined or the transaction may go through and result in things like fees and a negative impact to your credit scores.\nDoes opening a checking account affect your credit score?\nOpening a checking account doesn’t typically affect your credit scores. That’s because your credit scores reflect information in your credit reports. And the three major credit bureaus don’t include checking account information in credit reports.\nDoes closing a checking account affect my credit score?\nClosing a checking account also doesn’t typically affect your credit scores since checking accounts don’t show up in your credit reports. However, if your account has been closed because of an unpaid negative balance, it could go into collections. And an account in collections could be in your credit reports and affect your credit scores.\nOverdrafts and credit in a nutshell \nAn overdraft doesn’t usually affect your credit scores. But if you wait too long to resolve it and the account goes into collections, your credit scores could be affected.\nNo matter what, it’s always a good idea to monitor your credit. CreditWise from Capital One is one way to do that. You can access your TransUnion® credit report and VantageScore® 3.0 credit score without hurting your credit scores. And it’s free for everyone, whether or not you’re a Capital One cardholder.",

  "text": "March 14, 2024 |7 min read\nThere’s a lot to the world of personal finance. Maybe you’re new to managing your own finances. Maybe you’re taking on new financial responsibilities. Maybe you just want to give yourself a refresher. Whatever the case, it can be hard to know where to start or how to ensure you’re making the right choices. \nLearn more about what it means to be financially literate and a few basic concepts to help you get started.\nKey takeaways\nFinancial literacy involves concepts like budgeting, building and improving credit, saving, borrowing and repaying debt, and investing.\nBecoming more financially literate might make financial decisions related to loans, major purchases and investments less daunting.\nThere’s no shortage of places to learn more about finances, but it’s important to learn from trustworthy sources.\nWhat is financial literacy? \nFinancial literacy is about understanding concepts like budgeting, building and improving credit, saving, borrowing and repaying debt, and investing—and having the ability to apply them to real-life situations. \nIf financial well-being is the goal, financial literacy can be the first step toward achieving it. Becoming financially literate means learning basic concepts so you’re able to make better-informed decisions about your money and work toward your financial goals. \nThere’s no wrong time to make efforts to improve your financial literacy, and there’s always something new to learn when it comes to personal finance. The more financially literate you become, the more it could help you take actions that may ultimately bring you closer to a state of financial well-being.\nThe 5 components of financial literacy \nThere’s plenty to learn about personal financial topics, but breaking them down can help simplify things. To start expanding your financial literacy, consider these five areas: budgeting, building and improving credit, saving, borrowing and repaying debt, and investing. \n1. Budgeting \nA key first step to take as you build your financial literacy is to learn healthy spending habits. One way to do this is by learning to budget. You could start by identifying monthly expenses to include in your budget, which can help you track your spending.\nBudgeting can help ensure that you’re not overspending on nonessentials. And avoiding extra expenses can create more room for essentials and savings. There are many methods of budgeting, including:\nThe 50-20-30 method: This method involves setting aside 50% of your take-home income for your needs, 30% for your wants and 20% for savings.\nThe zero-based method: Monthly expenses and savings are subtracted from your take-home income and should reach zero so every dollar is used with intention.\nThe envelope method: This involves creating categories for all your monthly expenses and putting certain amounts of your take-home income into physical or digital envelopes for each category.\n2. Building and improving credit \nYour credit scores affect many areas of your financial life. Among other major decisions, your ability to buy a house, lease a car and apply for a credit card are all impacted significantly by how good your credit score is. That’s why knowing where your credit stands—and what steps you can take to improve your score—can be so important.\nUnderstanding what affects your credit scores can help you work toward building a healthy credit history and a good credit score over time. But there are still things you can do to help improve your score faster. It can be helpful to:\nApply only for credit you need.\nUnderstand how closing credit cards might affect the length of your credit history.\nKeep your credit utilization ratio at 30% or below, a level recommended by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \nMonitor your credit reports for errors on a regular basis and keep tabs on your credit scores for changes.\nWatch your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Generally, lenders like to see DTI ratios between 28% and 36%.\nThe more you can increase your creditworthiness, the more likely you’ll be to receive favorable terms and better interest rates on credit cards and other loans.\n3. Saving \nLearning to save is another important aspect of financial literacy. Saving can be done in many ways, including through traditional savings accounts, retirement savings funds, investment portfolios and emergency funds. \nIt can be helpful to clearly define your savings goals so you know exactly how much you’ll need to put aside. Managing bills and other expenses at the same time can make saving seem difficult. But there are ways to save money while paying off debt.\n4. Borrowing and repaying debt \nAt some point in your life, you’ll likely need to borrow money and take on some kind of debt to achieve a personal or financial goal or need, like attending college or completing renovations on your home. \nPersonal loans, mortgages and auto loans could all impact your credit and your financial situation by increasing the total amount of debt you have at any given time. And the more loans you have, the more you’ll have to pay toward your debts each month. But those same loans can make it easier for you to afford items that may otherwise be a financial stretch.\nCredit cards are another form of debt that can help with more than just everyday expenses. With responsible use, you can use a credit card to build credit. That means doing things like paying your statement balance on time each month and monitoring your credit utilization.\nUnderstanding the impact that taking on debt will have on your finances and establishing a concrete plan for paying down that debt and paying it on time are crucial when it comes to being financially literate.\n5. Investing \nOnce you’ve strengthened your grasp on budgets, credit, savings and debt, it can be wise to begin educating yourself on additional ways to build wealth and save for retirement.\nLearning about stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other types of investment opportunities might be a place to start. But it’s important to remember that investing involves risk. And there are different levels of risk and return, depending on the investment.\nWhy is financial literacy important? \nBy becoming financially literate, you’ll be better able to make important financial decisions while understanding how those decisions will impact your current and future financial situation. This can help you reach your goals, build your savings, manage your money and avoid or navigate potential setbacks that could take a toll on your finances.\nThe benefits of becoming financially literate \nNow that you understand why financial literacy matters, it may be helpful to see how financial literacy can directly benefit you:\nIt can help you prepare for emergencies: When you’re financially literate, you may be better able to assess your needs and plan for worst-case scenarios. This awareness may help you establish emergency savings so you can deal with financial strain without relying solely on loans and credit cards.\nIt can help you manage debt more effectively: Financial literacy can help you understand how each of your debts impacts your finances in the short and long term. This could make managing your debt easier and set you up to prioritize payments in a way that can ultimately reduce financial strain.\nIt can help you reach your goals: Financial literacy helps you be fully aware of your situation and how different money moves can impact your finances in the future. This may make it easier for you to reach your goals and stay motivated as you work toward achieving them based on your financial planning efforts.\nIt may improve your spending habits: Overspending can be a major problem for many people. But when you’re financially literate, you can fully understand how overspending will impact your finances. This could help you improve your spending habits so you can better manage your debt and save for the future.\nHow to become financially literate \nThe world of personal finance is ever-evolving. Making financial literacy a lifelong pursuit can help you stay informed and put you on a path to financial well-being.\nAs you begin to educate yourself on these personal finance topics to become more financially literate, it’s wise to choose your informational resources carefully. Here are a few places you might start:\nMyMoney.gov: A financial education website that was developed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Literacy and Education Commission\nConsumer education: A section of the CFPB website that provides readers with tools and information that can help them make more informed financial decisions\nInvestor.gov: A website created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to help readers learn more about how to invest and protect their investments\nConsumer advice: A website created by the Federal Trade Commission to help readers learn how to report fraud, avoid scams and educate themselves about finances\nLearn & Grow: A section of Capital One’s website that features helpful articles specifically geared toward helping readers gain a better understanding of a wide variety of personal finance topics\nFinancial literacy in a nutshell \nDeveloping financial literacy can be an important part of managing money and reaching your financial goals. And there are simple steps you can take to increase your financial knowledge and confidently apply what you learn.\nYou can get an idea of where your credit stands and monitor your progress with CreditWise from Capital One. It’s free, even if you’re not a Capital One customer, and using it won’t hurt your credit score. Plus, it has tools like the CreditWise Simulator that can help when you have to make financial decisions.",

  "text": "Whether you want to pay off debt, increase your income or save for a down payment, setting financial goals can help you plan for the life you want. But when it comes to financial planning, knowing where to start may seem overwhelming. The good news is that there are steps you can take to manage your money and reach your milestones.\nRead on to learn how to set financial goals and the strategies that could help you achieve them. \nKey takeaways\nFinancial goals are the money milestones you set to reach your wants and needs.\nA money management strategy is typically required in order to reach a financial goal.\nFinancial goals can be short term, like saving for a family vacation, or they can be long term, like saving for retirement. \nUsing goal-setting guidelines—like the SMART formula—could help you break down large financial goals into smaller tasks.\nWhat are financial goals? \nFinancial goals are the money milestones you set to reach your wants and needs. They can be great ways to orient yourself toward saving for the future. \nHowever, everyone’s financial situation is different. Your financial goals may depend on your current debt, cash flow or lifestyle. And your short-, mid- and long-term plans could also influence how you save and invest your money.\nExamples of financial goals \nHere are some common examples of financial goals at every stage of life:\nExamples of short-term financial goals \nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), short-term goals may take less than five years to achieve. They may include goals like:\nCreating a budget: Calculating your net income, living expenses and disposable income can help you understand your current financial situation and prioritize your spending. The 50-20-30 rule is a popular budgeting method that recommends using 50% of your income for expenses, 20% for savings and 30% for wants.\nImproving financial literacy: Setting financial goals may feel intimidating at first, but there are online resources that can help you learn about financial concepts. Knowing how to manage money can help you make decisions that support your long-term goals. \nSaving for a vacation: Financial goals aren’t only for needs, after all. Saving for vacation ahead of time can also save you the headache of money worries once you get there.\nExamples of mid-term financial goals \nIt may take five to 10 years to reach a mid-term financial goal. These goals may include:\nPaying off debt: If a chunk of your budget is going to high-interest debt payments each month, you won’t have as much money to put toward your saving or investing goals. The good news is that there are strategies you could use to pay off credit card debt or student loans so you can free up your finances.\nImproving your credit scores: Your credit scores are instrumental to your financial foundation because lenders could use them to determine your creditworthiness. They can affect your eligibility for loans or credit cards and the interest rates they come with.\nBuilding an emergency fund: An emergency fund is a dedicated savings account that you can use to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into your other accounts. The Fed recommends keeping at least three months of expenses in this fund.\nExamples of long-term financial goals \nLong-term goals, such as the following, may take more than a decade to accomplish:\nSaving for a down payment on a house: Buying a home is a great financial goal, but it typically requires saving for a down payment. It’s also important to consider how closing costs and private mortgage insurance payments could affect your down payment and home buying budget. \nSaving for retirement: There are different types of retirement funds—like traditional and Roth IRAs—that could help you reach your long-term financial goals. You could also see if your employer offers plans like 401(k)s or 403(b)s. Some companies even offer 401(k) matches as a fringe benefit.\nSaving for a child’s college education: If you have kids, saving for their future education may be a priority. Some people use 529 plans to prepare for college costs.\nHow to set financial goals \nDeciding on a financial goal is great, but that’s only half the battle. Knowing how to use goal-setting strategies can help you achieve your monetary milestones. Some experts recommend the SMART guidelines for setting financial goals. These guidelines may help you break down large goals into smaller, easy-to-track tasks. \nSMART stands for: \nSpecific: Specify the tasks you need to complete to reach your goal.\nMeasurable: Decide how you’ll track your progress.\nAttainable: Is the timeline doable? Does any part of the goal feel overwhelming? It’s important to ask questions, evaluate your progress and set realistic expectations. \nRelevant: Consider whether the goal aligns with your values and your desires for the future.\nTime-bound: You could set timelines for reaching your goals and break down large goals into smaller tasks that have their own deadlines.\nHow to prioritize and achieve financial goals \nWhen you have a financial goal in mind, it’s important to consider the timeline needed to achieve it. Prioritizing your goals can help you chart a time frame and develop an investment strategy that you can balance with your current lifestyle. \nIf you’re looking to improve your financial health, here are some steps you may want to take:\n1. Analyze your expenses \nTracking your expenses will help you determine your current cost of living and the amount of money you can realistically use for savings and debt payments.\n2. Focus on short-term goals first \nIt may be helpful to prioritize certain financial goals—like building an emergency fund—over less-pressing goals, such as saving for a vacation. Starting with smaller, more achievable goals—like paying off your smallest debt—can free up resources and help you fund your larger goals.\n3. Make savings automatic \nDirect deposits or recurring transfers can make it easy to save and invest money. Automating contributions can reduce the temptation to spend these funds on other things.\n4. Track your progress \nIt could be helpful to dedicate different accounts for different goals. This strategy could organize your finances so you can track your progress.\n5. Use the right accounts for your goals \nA high-yield savings account or a money market account (MMA) may help you save for your near-term goals. These types of accounts could give your money some padding from inflation while keeping your assets liquid. \nMoney market and savings accounts could also help you save for mid-term goals. You could also consider a certificate of deposit (CD). Many CDs require funds to remain in the account until the account’s maturity date. If you withdraw money early, you may have to pay a penalty. However, some CDs may not have early withdrawal fees.\nRetirement accounts—like 401(k)s and IRAs—can help you financially prepare for the future. These accounts are meant for long-term investing. If you need to withdraw money early, you could face a penalty. Again, if your employer matches your contributions, using them can help you have more savings for retirement.\n6. Talk to a professional \nYou don’t have to become an expert overnight. A certified financial planner can work with you to create savings and investment strategies tailored to your goals.\n7. Readjust and refine as needed \nHaving timelines for short-, mid- and long-term goals can help you track your progress and shift priorities as needed. Scheduling regular check-ins can help you see where you stand and help you figure out next steps.\nFinancial goals in a nutshell \nSetting a financial goal is a step toward financial security and success. As you work toward your monetary targets, remember to track your progress and adjust your plans as circumstances change. \nIf building your credit score is on your list of financial goals, consider CreditWise from Capital One. With CreditWise, you can monitor your VantageScore® 3.0 credit score and access your TransUnion® credit report at any time.

  "text": "Today, Capital One announced it will completely eliminate all overdraft fees and non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees for its consumer banking customers. Capital One will continue to provide free overdraft protection. \nCapital One is America’s 6th-largest retail bank and the only top-10 retail bank to make this move for all of its consumer bank products. \n“The bank account is a cornerstone of a person’s financial life,“ said Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s Founder and CEO. “It is how people receive their paycheck, pay their bills and manage their finances. Overdraft protection is a valuable and convenient feature and can be an important safety net for families. We are excited to offer this service for free.”\nFairbank continued, “Long ago, we set our sights on reimagining banking. Our award-winning checking accounts already feature no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements. Eliminating overdraft fees is another step in our effort to bring ingenuity, simplicity and humanity to banking.”\nCustomers can choose whether or not to access overdraft protection. All customers currently enrolled in overdraft protection will be automatically converted to No-Fee Overdraft on the launch date in early 2022.

  "text": "The standard overdraft fee isn’t the only one you risk if you bring your account below $0. There are other similar fees—non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees, overdraft protection fees and extended overdraft fees. Like the standard overdraft fee, these related fees also differ from bank to bank, so be sure to ask about them before opting into overdraft service.\nStandard overdraft fee\nThis is a fee many banks charge when you overdraft your account. Be aware that this isn’t a one-time fee—you can be hit with it each time you overdraft. This typically costs around $35.\nNon-sufficient fund (NSF) fee\nUnlike the standard overdraft fee, this is a fee the bank can charge if they decline a transaction that overdrafted your account. Another difference? Banks aren’t required to have customers opt in to NSF fees.1 Sometimes called insufficient funds fees, they’re common with bounced checks and automatic bill payments.1 And the fee typically costs the same as an overdraft fee.\nOverdraft protection fee\nAlso known as a transfer fee, you may incur this if you overdraft and your overdraft service is linked to a savings account or credit card.\nExtended overdraft fee\nYou may incur this fee if you overdraft your account and don’t replenish it within the next 5 to 7 days. This fee is usually given in addition to the standard overdraft fee—and you may keep getting hit with it if you keep your account in the negative. But like all fees, it differs from bank to bank.4\nBottom line: Like stepping on gum in your new shoes, having an overdraft isn’t ideal—but it happens. If you’re considering enrolling in your bank’s overdraft service, be sure to talk to them first about the rules and fees involved.",

  "text": "August 14, 2024 |4 min read\nWe live in the age of on demand. When you want to watch the latest summer blockbuster, get dinner from your favorite taqueria or find a ride to your friend’s birthday party, all you need to do is go online. And more and more, people are looking for a safe way to bank on demand, too.\nThis convenient option makes it possible for you to pay bills, deposit checks and keep an eye on your balance from almost anywhere. But if you’re new to online banking, you might be thinking, \"Are online banks safe?\"\nThe good news is many banks have features in place to protect you if you want to deposit your paycheck in your pajamas or pay the water bill from the sidelines of your kid’s soccer game. And as with other types of banking, there are things you can do that can help make your online banking experience even more secure.\nDon’t spend all night wondering to yourself \"how safe is internet banking?\" Instead, read on to learn more about how online banking security works and how to keep online banking safe.\nGetting to know online banking security \nPart of figuring out if online banking is safe and secure has to do with the technology many banks use to protect your data:\nMulti-factor authentication can be essential to safe online banking. It requires you to prove your identity in 2 or more ways before you’re let into your online bank accounts, and it can be a lot more difficult to hack.1 A password, PIN or physical card can be used to identify you. And so can biometrics like your fingerprint.\nResearch your bank to find out what online banking security measures it offers, and if you need to opt into certain ones, such as alerts. At many banks, an alert can be a call, text or email.\nIt may never have occurred to you that you’d want to be on a texting basis with your bank, but features like these can make it quick and easy to resolve problems. At many banks, if you receive an alert that indicates something is wrong, banking online means you can report a problem or disable your debit card with the simple click of a button from your desktop or mobile app.\nHabits that can help keep your accounts safe \nYou’re on your way to pick up a sofa you found online, and you’ve just made a pit stop at the ATM. With your wallet full of cash, you might be a little more cautious than usual. Maybe you take out your earbuds. Or maybe you move your wallet to your front pocket.\nWhen banking online, it can also be a good idea to take extra precautions, on top of what your bank is doing. While there’s not one safest way to bank online, these are a few of the best online banking security practices to try out:\nLook out for phishing emails or phone calls. If you receive a message from your great aunt Rosemary saying she was robbed in London and needs cash fast, but you know Rosemary hasn’t left Florida in 10 years, think twice before sending it. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warns against responding to unexpected requests for money or personal information.2\nPick strong passwords, and change them often. If a password is obvious to you, it could be obvious to someone else. Your wedding anniversary? Maybe not such a good idea. The anniversary of your first loose tooth? That’s random, but better. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has tips to help you choose your passwords.\nKeep your devices current. Treat anti-virus software as if it were a new Vietnamese restaurant or album from your favorite artist: Don’t sleep on it. The FTC suggests downloading anti-virus or other trustworthy security software onto your computer or phone and setting it to update automatically.3 Regularly backing up your files can be a good idea, too. If your data is hacked or tampered with, this can help you recover your records—including that list of Vietnamese restaurants to try.\nReconsider public Wi-Fi. When you access sensitive information (like your bank account) from an unsecured network (such as logging on at an airport), unauthorized users may be able to get access too.4 Catching up on cat videos? Totally OK on public Wi-Fi. But if you’re concerned with how to protect online banking, it’s probably best to bank from your home network.\nGood habits like these can protect you against the security risks of online banking by making it more difficult for someone else to access your account. \nIf you see something, say something \nSo you’ve done everything right, you’re reviewing your bill, and there it is: a $100 charge for pet shampoo. You don’t even have a dog. First, you might ask your significant other if they’ve visited any animal shelters lately. But if the answer is no, don’t panic.\nNo one wants to see a mistake on their bank statement. Be sure to report it to your bank as quickly as possible.5 You can also learn more from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about what to do if you notice an unauthorized transaction on your account.\nSo, how secure is online banking today? Let’s just say it can be a great option if you like living the digital life, don’t have time for regular bank visits or just don’t feel like putting on real pants. (We don’t judge.)\nIt’s normal to have concerns about online security. But when you take advantage of the many resources available to you at your bank, you can enjoy the convenience of online banking with more peace of mind.",

  "text": "August 21, 2024 |4 min read\nImagine if you could travel back in time 200 years. You’d tell your relatives that people can now bank using a tiny gadget. No more long horse rides into town to visit the bank—just take out a smartphone and voila, your bank is right there in your hands.\nBanking has come a long way. Now, you have your choice of whether to bank in person or remotely. What’s more, smartphones make it easy for you to do everything from check balances to pay bills from just about anywhere. Today, there are even banks that are online only. There was a time when you had to decide between online banks vs. traditional banks. But now, many banks have both options, so the difference between online banking and traditional banking boils down to personal choice. Some people prefer walking into a traditional bank branch while others want the convenience of connecting 24/7.\nOnline vs. traditional banks \nThese days, there’s really not a huge difference between traditional banking and online banking. If you compare online banking vs. traditional banking, you’ll see they usually offer pretty similar services.\nThe main difference is the option to bank in person. With banks that are online only, you may only be able to do your banking over the internet, through an app, at an ATM or by telephone. But most traditional banks offer online banking options, too. At traditional banks, you can do things like check balances, deposit money and pay bills. Most traditional banks also allow you to open accounts online, too. Traditional banks have added online banking in order to give their customers the best of both worlds: in person and online access.\nWhat are online banks? \nMost online banks are just like traditional banks in that they try to offer easy options for depositing money and paying bills. With an online bank, you can typically access your account on the internet or through a mobile app. ATMs may also be an option, but there may be fees in some cases.1\nOne benefit of most online banks is that they usually don’t have the same costs as physical locations. Because of that, they might be able to pass some of their savings to you with lower fees and higher interest savings rates on your deposits.1\nOnline vs traditional savings account \nA big difference between online savings vs. traditional savings accounts is how much interest you can earn. Online banks often offer higher interest rates on savings accounts than traditional banks.1 Before deciding where to open a savings account, compare the APY. The APY is the annual percentage yield, and it represents the amount of interest your savings will earn in a year.2\nAnother contrast between online and traditional savings accounts is that with a traditional account, you can bank in person. Because of that, some people still prefer traditional banking vs. e-banking (which is what some people call online banking). Others simply are not comfortable doing their banking online.\nAre online banks safe to use? \nYep, online banks are considered safe if they are a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Savings accounts at both traditional and online banks, covered by the FDIC up to allowable limits, protect you from bank failure. Online banks in the U.S. have to follow the same rules and regulations as traditional banks.3\nWhile online banks are typically just as safe as traditional banks, it’s important to make sure that your transactions are secure. That means choosing passwords that are hard for anyone to guess. You also should protect your personal information and take precautions when using public Wi-Fi. And if you see anything suspicious, like emails from bank addresses you don’t recognize, be sure to contact your bank right away.\nWhile your great, great grandparents may have had their minds blown, online banking has become a popular preference for anyone who wants access to their bank anytime and from just about anywhere. Choosing between an online and traditional bank really comes down to personal preference. While some online banks offer higher interest rates, the gap between online and traditional banks is getting smaller. For some people, being able to go into a branch is important. But for others, the ease of online banking is all they really need.",

  "text": "Once you’ve decided which bank you want to use, it’s time to fill out your application online. If you’re under 18, you may need a guardian to co-sign the account. The application process will vary from bank to bank. But all banks are required to verify your identity.5 So it’s helpful to have the following things handy:\nYour driver’s license, passport or other government-issued ID card\nSocial Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)\nA blank check, debit card or credit card to make that first deposit\nAnd you’ll usually need an email address, mailing address and a phone number. Once you have that ready, here’s how to open a bank account online:\nGo to the bank’s website. Stay safe! Any time you’re entering personal information online, take extra care. Find the link to \"open an account.\" (Scroll down the homepage to the site map if you’re having trouble finding the link.)\nChoose the type of account you want. Most banks let you compare different kinds of accounts to help you decide. Do you want an individual account or do you want to open a joint account online? Do you want things like overdraft protection and the ability to earn interest? From checking and savings accounts to CDs and IRAs, there are many types of accounts you can open online.\nFill out an application. Next, you’ll enter all of your personal information. You might also set up your username and password and create security questions to help protect your account.\nAgree to let the bank collect some information. Sometimes, submitting your application will automatically begin the approval process, but some banks might ask you to review disclosures and privacy policies first. In some cases you’ll have to answer a few legal questions then check a box that lets the bank collect information about you and your credit.\nCheck the approval process. Some banks will tell you if you’re approved right away, while others might take a bit longer. You can always sign in later to check on the status of your application or call the bank if you have questions. If you’re not approved, you might have to go into the branch to finish the process.\nMake your first deposit. Once you’re approved, you’ll want to put some money in your new account. You can do this from another account online or over the phone. If it’s your first account, you may need to do this step in person with cash or a check.\nWith your account set up, you’re all ready to begin banking online! Depending on the account and its features, you may be able to write checks, pay bills with your bank account online, set up direct deposit and more right away. And remember: Always keep your username and password in a safe place where no one can find it.\nDown the road, you may wonder \"Can I close a bank account online?\" You can, but each bank handles it a bit differently. Gather your account information, then check your bank’s policy on its website. Or call or stop by if you’d prefer to discuss it in person.6\nBanking today brings lots of choices, including the ability to get a whole lot done from the comfort of your home. From opening an account to paying bills, online banking was built for convenience–yours.\nOf course, there will always be hoops to jump through, but making things simpler while safeguarding your money is what online banking is all about.",

  "text": "Spark Business Card Questions\nWhat information will I need to provide when I apply?\nYou will need to know some basic personal information, as well as some information about your business—including your business’s total annual revenue and your business Tax ID Number or Employer ID Number.\nWhat do you mean by Tax ID Number (TIN) or Employer ID Number (EIN)?\nThis is a nine-digit number that’s assigned to nearly every U.S. business by the IRS to ensure tax compliance. It’s like the equivalent of a Social Security Number for a business. A business tax ID is required for business card applications for all business structures except Sole Proprietorships.\nCan I apply for a business card by phone?\nYou can apply for a business card online or by calling 1-866-390-5934. Or, if you received an offer in the mail, you can apply by calling the phone number listed on your letter, online or by mail. Please refer to the reservation number and access code listed in your letter.\nHow can I contact Capital One about my business card application?\nIf you have questions about an application that you’ve already submitted, please call 1-800-903-9177 to speak with an experienced customer service representative.\nHow quickly can I expect to get my card?\nOnce your application has been approved, you should receive your business card within 10 business days.\nCan I pay my bill online?\nYes. Once you get your business card, you can enroll in online banking to pay your bill. You can also mail your payments using U.S. Mail or expedited mail service such as FedEx. You can find our mailing address on our contact us page.\nCan I change my payment due date? \nYes. After your account is open, you can call Customer Relations to request a different payment due date.\nHow do I transfer a balance from another account to my Capital One account?\nAfter your account is open, you can call Customer Relations to discuss your balance transfer options. You will not be able to transfer a balance from another account issued or acquired by Capital One or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.\nWhat other benefits does this card offer for my business?\nWith your card, you'll get numerous benefits, such as a year-end summary to help you track expenses by category, $0 fraud liability if your card is ever lost or stolen and employee cards upon your request at no additional cost. check out our full list of business credit benefits.\nHow do you apply my payments?\nWe apply your minimum payment to lower rate balances (including 0% APR) before higher rate ones. We apply any portion of your payment in excess of your minimum payment to higher rate balances before lower rate ones. If your payment exceeds the minimum payment by an amount sufficient to pay a higher rate balance shown on your statement, you still may have a balance at that higher rate on your next statement as a result of transactions, interest, or fees charged to your account before your payment was credited. For example, if your monthly statement shows a $1,000 balance for cash advances, sending in a check for $1,000 plus your minimum payment amount may not bring your cash advance balance to $0. This is because interest continues to accrue on the $1,000 balance between the last day of the statement and the date we receive your payment, but the interest does not post to your account until the next statement.",

  "text": "August 7, 2024 |5 min read\nThere was a time when every act of banking required parking your car, walking inside, waiting in line and interacting with a human bank teller. While some may still prefer a physical banking experience, you should know there’s a long list of services offered by online banking. With no lines and 24-hour access, online banking is a convenient and easy option worth considering. \nPhysical banks aren’t going away, but if you’re new to online banking or are looking to better utilize advancing technology, here is a list of online banking services that may make your financial life a little easier.\nOpening an account \nWhether you want a checking account, a savings account, or even a CD or money market account, many banks allow you to open the account without stepping foot in a branch. That means less time and less hassle.\nDepending on the bank, you’ll need personal details like your driver’s license number and your Social Security number. If you have those handy, you may be able to start banking online in a matter of minutes.1\nMobile deposits \nYou can probably still picture the experience: the stacks of deposit slips, the pens chained to the desk, plastic tubes ferrying your money into the ether. Depositing money was one of the last transactions that required traveling to the bank. While you can still visit your branch if you really miss those pens, you now have more options when it comes to depositing your checks.\nOf all the online banking benefits and advantages, few save more time than mobile deposits. Many bank apps now allow customers to endorse a check, photograph it and deposit it in a matter of minutes—an act so seamless it feels a little like magic. Banks sometimes place limits on how much you can deposit in a single transaction or over the course of a day, and sometimes all of the funds aren’t available immediately.2 But even with those limitations, depositing a check by app is a great time-saving perks of online banking features and services.\nOnline (and automatic) transfers \nSaving money can be challenging. Banks with online banking services make it a little easier. Instead of having to write a check from one account to another, you can simply transfer money from your checking into your savings account with a few clicks.\nMaybe you’re saving up for a trip across the pond. You could occasionally jump online and move some money from checking to savings, which on most bank sites can be done in a few clicks. Many banks also allow you to set up automatic transfers at scheduled times.3 Each week or month, you can have your bank transfer money from checking to savings, keeping you on track for that trip. Or you can have a portion of your paycheck transferred into savings every pay period, keeping you on track without even thinking about it.\nTransferring money between accounts to friends or family is another one of the services provided by online banking. If you’re out to dinner with a group or chipping in on a big birthday gift, you can easily send money from your account without having to ask if anyone has change for a $20.\nOnline bill pay \nWhether it’s your cell phone carrier or cable provider, most companies allow you to pay bills on their websites. But it can be hard to keep track of all those accounts, which is where the financial services for online banking really comes in handy.\nSetting up bill pay on your bank's website or mobile app brings all of your bills to one location. From a single page, you can add or delete payees, pay a one-time charge or schedule recurring payments (like rent) for automatic monthly withdrawal.4 The bank will even mail physical checks if you prefer.5 No more missing a payment if you're out of town or out of stamps.\nBuilding a budget \nThere are all types of online banking services that can help you manage your budget. But helping you track your spending may be the most crucial.\nMany banks allow customers to see exactly how they’re spending their money by automatically categorizing each expense as “groceries,” “entertainment” and so on. Some banks even break that spending into handy graphics, allowing you to visualize just how much of your money you spend on dining out. Other banks allow you to set up specific saving goals, so you can identify what you’re saving for, track your progress and even celebrate your success. All this makes it easier than ever to build and track your personal financial budget.\nOnline banking security \nOf course, banking online raises questions about security. Will your money—and your personal information—be safe?\nMost banks take steps to keep your account safe, including secure sign-in procedures, automated alerts about suspicious purchases and other measures to protect you and your money. You can also take measures to protect your personal information and safely use public Wi-Fi.\nAccessing money \nEven if you don’t have a physical bank to walk into, you still have many ways to access your money. You could connect your debit card with a mobile wallet app on your smartphone and pay digitally. If you need to pay someone back, you can transfer money between accounts to friends or family. And if you need cash, you could visit the ATM or get cash back when you use your debit card.\nCustomer service \nSome problems are just more easily solved by talking to a real person. While you may not get the face-to-face interaction from online banking, you can generally reach out by phone to customer service representatives who spend their days helping solve issues. So if you ever have a problem, you have access to someone who can help at your fingertips\nMobile banking apps \nYou probably use apps on your smartphone every day. You can manage your online banking just as easily as checking the weather. With a tap of your finger, you’ve got all your account information and banking capabilities available to you. And depending on your phone, your fingerprint can serve as your password to keep your account secure.\nOther online banking benefits and advantages \nIf you haven't touched your checkbook in a while, it's probably because your debit card is doing the heavy lifting. And bank card online services get more robust each day. Most banks let customers compare and order debit cards online, report cards missing or stolen, and get quick and easy credit reports. All of these services combine to make bank cards as convenient and secure as they’ve ever been.\nBanks are a wonderful resource, but there are so many things you can do online—from paying your bills to making a savings plan to seeing exactly how much you spent at your favorite takeout joint last month. For these and other reasons, it’s worth getting to know your bank’s online services.",

  "text": "With a certificate of deposit (CD) account, you can save money for a fixed amount of time, called a term. In return for leaving your money in the CD, you earn a fixed interest rate—unlike traditional savings accounts, which have variable interest rates that are subject to change. Capital One CD terms range from 6 months to 60 months. Keep in mind, you can’t access your money until your CD term ends without incurring a penalty. \nSince CD account rates are often higher than traditional savings accounts, CDs are a great way to reach your savings goals faster using money that you don't need immediately.\nLearn more about CDs.",

  "text": "January 10, 2024 |4 min read\nEditor's note: This article has been updated from its original publication Aug. 17, 2023\nWith interest rates near their highest level in more than 15 years, business owners and investors are looking to stabilize their finances and mitigate risk. We asked Joel Essington, managing director and head of corporate rates derivatives origination for Capital One, for strategies and tactics they can adopt to cope with market volatility and financial uncertainty. \nQ: Why does managing interest-rate risk matter for businesses? \nJE: No one can predict the future, and companies should be in the business of running their business and not speculating or taking a view on how the debt markets and interest rates will perform. An effective risk strategy can smooth out some of the volatility and introduce the concept of greater predictability independent of what happens to interest costs. \nQ: How does interest-rate volatility impact financial performance? \nJE: It’s entirely capital-structure dependent. When you combine the dynamic nature of corporate balance sheets and introduce the concept of interest rate volatility and financial risks into that equation, it raises concerns about earnings stability, cash-flow generation, and so forth. Most businesses, especially publicly traded ones, want certainty and visibility. They want the ability to budget and plan and forecast accurately to their investors. So mitigating interest-rate risk should be front of mind, especially with markets like they are today.\nQ: Given that low interest rates persisted for so long, is it harder for businesses to shift their interest-rate strategies today? \nJE: We've been spoiled for a long time in terms of a low volatility, low nominal-rate environment. And there certainly appears to be some thought that things will revert to “normal.” But there are additional steps that need to be taken in today's environment in case that is an incorrect view. \nQ: What are those steps? \nJE: One strategy for managing interest expense on a short-term basis can be traditional cash-flow hedging, in which variable rate risks are managed through a combination of pay-fixed interest-rate swaps or interest-rate options. For businesses that are more reliant on public bond markets, instruments such as forward-starting swaps and options on swaps, or “swaptions,” may eliminate volatility and potential price risk. \nQ: Can you give an example of how that works?\nJE: A company may have 100% exposure to the Term Loan A, pro rata, or institutional loan market. Those credit facilities are 100% variable in nature. Therefore, on issuance of those types of debt facilities, a company has exposure to short-term rates going forward. Most balance sheets do not support adding concentrated risk on either end of the spectrum—100% floating or 100% fixed. So implementing a paid fixed interest rate swap can provide a more neutral balance. If you can do 50% fixed and 50% floating, or something in that range, it’s a more prudent strategy. \nQ: How should a company evaluate an effective hedging strategy? \nJE: Each scenario is different. It depends on the cyclicality of a business and capacity on the balance sheet for absorbing interest-rate risk. Once a company identifies the interest rate factors affecting their business, the next step is to determine the appropriate strategy to mitigate rate volatility over time. But it’s important to remember that these strategies should be developed independent of market conditions. That can be difficult to remember in the current environment, but managing rate risk and financial risk should not be a reactionary response to market conditions. \nQ: How can this help create cash-flow certainty? \nJE: With hedging, you are effectively mitigating volatility by locking in either an interest rate or a nominal amount of a hedge through a specific duration of that underlying transaction. That essentially creates certainty around free cash-flow generation. So hedging is a prudent strategy for reducing financial market risk, and it can be an important component of a broader risk management strategy. \nQ: Why should companies optimize their risk management strategy?\nJE: Having a disciplined, targeted approach to hedging and in managing the specific funding mix for the balance sheet over time is essential. You can't necessarily predict or navigate around what the debt markets will bring. But you can provide some certainty in terms of preservation of economic value, specifically around interest rate, risk, and volatility. Prudent risk managers should focus on developing an internal framework and risk management policy, independent of market conditions, which focuses on: \nQuantifying exposures and understanding their risk tolerance\nDefining risk management objectives and evaluating alternatives\nFormally documenting their hedge policy and obtaining internal approvals that are required to move forward with their strategic objectives\nWorking with relationship banks to address pre-trade documentation, credit-limit capacity and regulatory requirements that are needed to implement their strategy. \nTo learn more about our derivatives and hedging capabilities, click here.\nDisclaimers & disclosures\nThis material has been prepared by the Sales and Trading Personnel at Capital One, N.A., its affiliates or subsidiaries (“Capital One”) with responsibilities for marketing and sale of swaps and other derivatives.

  "text": "Capital One's Kristen Croxton explains that, in this market, creativity is key to financing your next deal. \nAugust 16, 2023 |4 min read\nFor the past 2 years, apartment complexes and other multifamily properties were among the most attractive investments in commercial real estate. But higher interest rates have curtailed demand for multifamily properties. \nMultifamily real estate is any residential building with 5 or more units covered by a single deed. In the past few years, the demand for multifamily properties rose as work-from-home policies drove demand. In addition, supply chain disruptions limited construction materials, reducing the number of new units coming on the market and driving up rental revenue.\nDespite the challenging environment, many sellers are still expecting a premium similar to what they could have received a year or 2 ago. That’s led to a disconnect between the prices sellers will accept for their properties and what buyers are willing to pay. \nInterest rates touched historic lows during the COVID-19 pandemic, then began rising in 2022 as the Federal Reserve increased the benchmark interest rate to combat inflation. Interest on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.2% in October, and by late spring 2023 it had fallen back to about 3.5% before rising to 4% in mid-July. Multifamily lending rates, which typically move in tandem with Treasuries, have remained in the 5.5% to 6% range for a 10-year product, said Kristen Croxton, senior vice president for loan originations at Capital One Agency Finance.\n“It’s been very challenging to predict where rates are going to at any given time,” Croxton said during a Commercial Real Estate Women’s Network webinar in April. “As recently as last year, people were expecting to buy at rates of 3% or 3.5% and now they’re at 5.5% or 6%, and that has a big impact on the ability to buy.” \nHigher rates affect the loan amounts that buyers can support, and as a result, their deals may require that they provide more equity. At the same time, many sellers have not adjusted their asking prices.\n“There’s a breakdown between buyers and sellers as to what is real value,” Croxton said.\nHigher rates take a toll \nBy the start of this year, higher interest rates were taking a significant toll. First quarter sales fell 74 percent compared with the year prior. \nThe higher rates have also affected interest rate caps, which buyers use to hedge against rising rates. Caps are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a broad measure of short-term borrowing costs. SOFR is used to set a strike price for caps over a period of years. For example, a 2-year cap with a 3% strike will pay if SOFR exceeds 3% over the next 2 years.\nEighteen months ago, borrowers could buy a 2-year cap with 3% strike on a $20 million deal for 9 basis points. By July 2023, the price had risen to 376.8 basis points. As a result, buyers who purchased caps 2 years ago are finding them much more expensive to renew. \n“If you’re assuming a $20 million deal, that [two-year cap 18 months ago] was about $18,000,” Croxton said. “Today, your $18,000 cost went up to $754,000.” \nWhile the caps can provide some protection for buyers in the short term, lenders typically assess escrow requirements semi-annually or annually. As escrow demands increase, buyers face a double hit. \n“Interest-rate caps are putting a ton of pressure on cash flow. Escrow requirements are increasing, and so are mortgage payments because of floating rates,” Croxton said. \nThe result can hurt cash flow from the property. Fortunately for buyers, rents in most markets remain strong. But expenses such as insurance can be more challenging in some markets, she said.\nNew information for sellers \nAll these factors may force some institutional investors to sell properties as the uncertain economic outlook is driving an increase in requests from fund investors to withdraw cash. \nBecause interest rates were low for so long—and interest rate caps were stable—sellers don’t yet have a clear picture of what’s happening in the market. As more data comes out, sellers may adjust their prices, which could lead to more deals, Croxton said. “Sellers will start to understand where the current value of their asset sits,” she said. “And they may bring it to market and have buyers that can buy the asset at that level.” \nWhile lower interest rates would help restore some of the lost luster to the multifamily market, the Fed raised benchmark rates another 25 basis points in July 2023—to their highest in 22 years. \nDespite the uncertain economic outlook, delinquencies on multifamily loans remain little changed, Croxton said. As of March 2023, delinquencies tracked by Fannie Mae were 0.13%, while those for Freddie Mac were at 0.35%. \nBuyers seeking financing for multifamily investments still have options. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been able to offer competitive loans despite rising interest rates, in some cases through favorable loan terms. Early rate lock programs can reduce interest-rate volatility by mitigating the risk that rates will increase during the underwriting process.\nThe two agencies also have programs that offer more favorable terms for properties that install green-energy installations or support affordable housing.\nWhile the uncertainty of interest rates continues to impact the multifamily market, buyers that know where to look can find the right loan programs for their needs and continue to reap the benefits of multifamily real estate investments. \nRelated Content\nArticle | January 6, 2023 \nArticle | November 7, 2022 \n|8 min read",

  "text": "August 16, 2023 |2 min read\nCapital One successfully provided investment funding for the much-needed expansion of a local early childhood development center in Evanston, Wyoming. The project was fostered in partnership with local institutions, regional nonprofits and public funding to bolster resources for a vulnerable community.\nThe U.S. Department of Treasury oversees a federal initiative called the New Markets Tax Credit Program (NMTC). Launched in 2000, the NMTC program helps spur growth among low-income communities across the United States by incentivizing capital investment. It offers tax credits to investors in exchange for support of vital projects that benefit local communities. It has since distributed more than $100 million in local investments in Wyoming and created more than 1,000 new jobs via initiatives like Northern Arapaho Tribe’s Wind River Cares Clinic and Red Wolf Child Care Center in Riverton. \nIn Evanston, the Evanston Childhood Development Center (ECDC) was overburdened—its preschool and childcare offerings operating at capacity for several years running. Serving 500 mostly low-income children, it had recently raised phase one funds to move out of a temporary facility into something more permanent. However, even after scaling back the project, it still fell short of achieving its phase two goals.\nWith help from Capital One and MoFi, a regional nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), ECDC will add 7,049-square-feet to the new first phase building. Local residents with infants to children up to 5 years old will now have 100 new childcare spots for essential care. The financing will also bring approximately 25 new jobs to the city, many of which are expected to be filled by single parents.\nMoFi worked with local leaders to identify the project as an opportunity to make a major positive impact on a community in need. Capital One invested in the tax credits from MoFi, thereby helping to fund a second phase of ECDC, enabling it to maintain and expand services.\nTo learn more about Capital One and our commitments to NMTC investments, click here.",

  "text": "As a C-Suite executive, you likely understand all too well the risk of relying on one or only a few suppliers for vital goods and services. If a supplier experiences delays in fulfilling an order, it can cause serious disruptions throughout your company—affecting both performance and profits. The need to find alternate sources for essential products has never been more urgent than it is today. That's why understanding how to diversify your supplier base is crucial to helping reduce risk and improving overall success and profitability in the long term. \nIn this blog post, we'll explore 6 strategies to diversifying your supplier family. These tips may help your business ensure product quality, reduce costs and gain new perspectives toward reaching a wider range of customers. \n1. Understand your current suppliers and their strengths/weaknesses\nUnderstanding your current suppliers and their strengths and weaknesses is an essential step for any business looking to diversify its supplier base. Keep track of the reliability and quality provided by any current suppliers so you can create a benchmark for choosing new ones. Knowing what your current suppliers bring to the table in terms of quality, cost, production time, customer service and other key criteria also helps identify areas where diversity can add value and complement existing capabilities. \n2. Identify market trends in terms of materials and services\nStaying ahead of current market trends is an important part of diversifying your supplier base and keeping your business competitive. Knowing what materials and services are currently in demand, as well as anticipating future needs, will help you determine which suppliers to engage with and how best to allocate resources. Actively monitor the market, so you can stay aware of any changes that may require your business to adjust or modify your suppliers or processes. This will help streamline your operations while also improving efficiency, quality and cost management.\n3. Establish criteria for evaluating potential suppliers \nWhen selecting potential suppliers, it's imperative to go through an evaluation process. Having pre-defined criteria that highlight what you're looking for in a supplier will aid you in selecting the appropriate one. Be thorough in assessing whether a supplier is right for you, including factors like delivery quality, ability to reduce overhead costs and financial stability. Additionally, vary your criteria across different departments, if needed. This will ultimately lead to more effective decision making. \n4. Develop an approach to onboard new suppliers \nDeveloping a streamlined onboarding process can bring many advantages, from faster timeline execution to better cost management. To ensure there is a streamlined approach, your business should create a workflow that establishes key steps and responsibilities for the onboarding process. This checklist will provide team members with guidance, clear expectations and adequate resources to onboard new suppliers. Following this method can also help you create productive relationships from the beginning. \n5. Monitor performance and incorporate feedback from existing suppliers\nAn essential part of managing any supplier base is periodically monitoring performance and identifying any areas for improvement. Your business should incorporate this feedback into their operations to ensure that the best-suited suppliers are actively engaged in the procurement process. Doing so can increase your competitiveness in sourcing quality goods and services at scale.\n6. Create a supplier diversity program to empower small and underrepresented suppliers\nWhen choosing new suppliers, it’s important to ensure they’re diverse in ownership, staff and perspectives, too. A supplier diversity program will help your business use more small, local and minority-owned suppliers. In doing so, your business will not only support the communities from which the suppliers originate, but also expand your audience and customer base. Additionally, the generally smaller size of these suppliers often allows them to be more nimble, innovative and willing to adapt to change. This will give your business an advantage should there be a shift in the marketplace or your procurement needs. \nAdopting a strategy of supplier diversification can help ensure stability, competitive pricing and innovation. With an understanding of current suppliers and market trends, intelligent criteria for evaluating potential suppliers and a streamlined onboarding process, you can build a robust supplier base tailored to your needs across industries. Stay ahead by thinking strategically about diversifying your supplier base and implementing one or all these tactics into your business processes.",

  "text": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and automation has already started to change the way businesses operate. But how exactly do these tools work, and how can businesses like yours leverage them to create additional value and efficiency? \nRead on to learn more about AI, ML and automation, how businesses are using them to enhance processes and how your business can implement this technology in an effective, responsible way. \nWhat are AI, machine learning and automation? \nSimply put, artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of software that’s designed to simulate human thinking. It uses algorithms to analyze data and make decisions based on that data. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that focuses on giving computers the ability to learn from data without being programmed to do so. Machine learning also uses algorithms to identify patterns in data, which are then used to make predictions and decisions. \nAutomation—the use of technology to perform repetitive tasks—can be used in combination with AI and machine learning. Automation technologies often follow pre-programmed rules to automate tasks, minimizing the need for human input or intervention.\nHow businesses are leveraging AI and machine learning today \nAround the world, businesses are using automation technology to serve a vast number of purposes, from fraud detection to image recognition to predictive analytics. Understanding these common use cases can not only help your business discover new opportunities within your own processes, but also help you keep up in your current marketplace. \nThough the uses for AI and machine learning vary by industry, business size and goal, many use cases fall under three categories: \nEnhancing customer service\nAs you know, customer satisfaction is crucial to the success of every business. AI and machine learning can help streamline your customer service channels, including automated phone trees, chatbots and more. Many businesses also use data-driven AI to better understand their customers and deliver more personalized experiences across different touchpoints.\nIncreasing efficiency\nOne of the most common uses for automation technology is to increase efficiency. Because automation reduces the need for human intervention, integrating AI/ML into simple or repetitive processes has allowed businesses to allocate their staff to higher-value tasks. In industries like manufacturing, automation can help eliminate waste, optimize resources and reduce production times. Some businesses are also beginning to use AI to generate first drafts or outlines of content, which allows more time for ideation, collaboration and creative thinking. \nImproving cost savings\nFor many businesses, cost savings is the primary motivation behind integrating AI and machine learning. This can be achieved by increasing efficiency, as mentioned above, or even increasing their output of a product or service. Another way that businesses are reducing cost is through advancements in fraud detection. With the help of machine learning, companies are able to detect fraudulent activity faster and more accurately, significantly reducing financial losses. \nOther ways AI and machine learning can help create value for your business \nAutomation is quickly becoming a tool that’s used across industries and the world. But beyond just increasing efficiency, how can using AI and machine learning translate to increased value for your business? \nIn addition to saving time and money, the use of automation technology can also be a valuable way to build customer relationships. AI and machine learning can help your business interact more closely with customers and learn about their preferences. With this insight, you can further customize the user experience, which may lead to increased sales opportunities and help you towards building customer loyalty.\nAnother way AI and machine learning can create value is through predictive analytics. This tool can help your business anticipate future trends, so you can make informed decisions about business strategies and position yourself competitively in your marketplace moving forward. \nOpportunities and challenges of AI\nAs companies within the TMT sector increasingly integrate AI into their businesses, opportunities continue to grow. But there are also challenges, risks and complexities that companies in this industry are facing as well. \nContent generation, for example, is one area where AI is already causing significant disruption. These tools can assist in generating personalized content for marketing, advertising or entertainment. But there is also the potential for biased or misleading content. This is because large language models, while incredibly powerful, can inadvertently generate content based on incorrect or prejudiced information. Biased content can also find its way into other applications, like chatbots, as well.\nEnsuring that the content developed with AI tools is free of harmful biases is essential, and businesses in the TMT sector appear to address these concerns proactively as they further expand automation tools. Companies like Google and IBM, for example, do so by supporting responsible, ethical approaches to AI development and usage. \nBalancing the need for efficiency and innovation with the potential social consequences of AI implementation is a crucial aspect of responsible AI adoption, regardless of the industry it’s deployed in. But by embracing these technologies responsibly and strategically, businesses in the TMT sector and beyond can create positive impact and value throughout their business.\nBest practices for implementing automation technologies into your business processes \nAs automation technology continues to advance, it’s important to follow best practices when implementing AI and machine learning:\n1. Start small\nA general rule of thumb is to always start small and expand gradually. This will allow your business to thoroughly test the technology and make adjustments before incorporating any automation into a larger process. \n2. Keep everyone in the know\nIt’s critical that your business involves all relevant departments and employees when planning new AI or machine learning usages. This will ensure that everyone understands the role of these technologies, so they can take advantage of and fully utilize the benefits they offer. \n3. Evaluate and make adjustments\nOnce implemented, it’s important to regularly evaluate and adjust the automation process to ensure it continues to meet the needs of your business. And because AI and machine learning are constantly evolving, your business should regularly examine the latest updates available, advancements in best practices and any updated usage guidance. \n4. Prioritize risk-management and responsibility\nIn general, businesses should strive to build and deploy AI and machine learning responsibly. It’s encouraged for all businesses to approach the use of emerging technology in a way that prioritizes risk management and puts people first. \nAI, machine learning and automation in a nutshell \nThere are many benefits that businesses can gain from AI, machine learning and automation. By utilizing some of the best practices for implementation, your business can more effectively leverage these tools within your current ways of working. And by keeping in mind the limitations and ever-growing advancements of this technology, you can help position your business competitively today and in the future.",

  "text": "July 19, 2023 |5 min read\nWhether you manage a small grassroots operation or a large charitable organization, nonprofits need to conduct a wellness check to ensure stable financials and streamline operations. Because of the rise of various fraud schemes targeting nonprofits over the last several years, organizations are placing a stronger emphasis this year on implementing developed financial management controls to streamline operations and improve organizational security. \nThis article offers five tips for nonprofit financial management so you feel prepared and empowered when conducting a financial wellness check.\n1. Educate teammates on fraud \nDue to both its high reliance on volunteer employees and different internal controls than regulated organizations, the nonprofit sector is estimated to lose approximately $4.5 trillion each year to various fraud schemes. The most common types impacting nonprofits include:\nBusiness email compromise (BEC) scams: Cybercriminals gain access to company records via fraudulent emails posing as a trusted partner.\nACH Payment fraud: Cybercriminals use stolen account information to complete an unauthorized ACH transaction into their private account.\nEndorsement fraud: A signature is forged on a stolen/counterfeit check.\nCredit card fraud: Cybercriminals make small donations with stolen cards to test their validity for other purchases, causing chargeback fees to the organization.\nIt should be noted that banking solutions cannot prevent fraud from happening; having the right support, however, can help mitigate the potential circumstances that arise from fraud when detected. Nonetheless, nonprofits seeking to reduce the impact of fraud in the coming year can reference this guide to educate employees on how to spot these scams, as well as several others and how to help protect the organization when they do. \n2. Streamline the payment process \nRather than donations themselves, membership often forms the financial foundation for most nonprofits, the top performers prioritize a positive donation experience for their members. This approach not only increases the likelihood of potential members making a contribution but can also lead to a larger donation amount than initially intended.\nWith that in mind, nonprofits should make the following adjustments to their payment process: \nSimplify your organization's payments: Look for opportunities to remove paper from your processes and use streamlined electronic transactions wherever possible. This will help your organization stay organized, save time and money and avoid possible postal system delays. \nOptimize for devices: Ensure your site is navigable on web and mobile devices to meet the needs of various member types.\nConsult with banking associates: Collaborate with your bank to ensure that they are offering all of the needed payment options to members/members. \n3. Leverage technology \nTechnology can help empower nonprofits to optimize operations, enhance financial systems and unlock efficiencies. By updating financial systems and integrating enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, nonprofits can:\nAutomate tasks: ERP systems are designed to automate menial everyday tasks such as inventory management, procurement, finance, accounting and marketing. This helps reduce the liability for human error or manipulation in these systems and keeps data updated more consistently than it would be through human means. \nImprove accuracy: Because ERPs collect financial data in one place, they help reduce the need for excessive compiling or transferring of data across systems. This is especially helpful for non-profits often working with systems that do not easily communicate with each other.\nMaximize resource utilization: ERPs automatically budget and report on systems they control, allowing non-profits to quickly assess what resources are and aren’t being used. This helps them make crucial decisions about member benefits, payroll and event planning without having to switch between various systems.\nModern systems offer real-time insights for better decision-making, budget tracking and transparent expense management. Integration of ERPs centralizes functions, streamlines workflows, eliminates data silos and enables efficient collaboration. \nLeveraging technology can engage members, volunteers and stakeholders through online platforms, social media and mobile apps. It enhances reach, member relationships, impact measurement, transparency and accountability.\n4. Prioritize business resiliency planning \nBecause budgets at nonprofits are typically limited, it’s critical for your organization’s health to ensure that you are prepared for unexpected events that may cause unforeseen strain. It’s critical that organizations make backup plans so that your organization is prepared for setbacks in the future. Consider the following:\nExamine your payroll structure: Ensuring that your vendors, employees and paid volunteers receive payment on time is a critical element of staying afloat through tenuous economic conditions. Companies should ensure that their payroll and other internal systems are capable of being run both in-office and remotely to ensure that payments can be made regardless of the external conditions.\nEvaluate your organization's cash flow: Liquidity plays a crucial role during economic downturns. Having sufficient liquidity enables organizations to respond swiftly to changing market conditions, reallocate assets and adjust funding as needed. This adaptability can help them navigate economic challenges more effectively. \nFocus on adaptability: Hold a regular meeting to evaluate your company’s preparedness for changing environments (e.g., natural disasters, public relations crises) to assess potential weak points. Consider aspects like company culture, historical financial strength and the level of debt the organization carries.\nFor nonprofits seeking advice on how to start this process, this resource has specific tips for building resilience into existing processes.\n5. Pay attention to finance system hygiene \nIt’s a less glamorous aspect of performing a wellness check, but I’s must be dotted and T’s crossed. Nonprofits run through a great deal of paperwork pertaining to members, vendors and employees which need to be properly organized and secured. We recommend the following checklist items:\nExamine your contacts: Review your list of vendors and members to eliminate redundancies or outdated records. \nEliminate previously authorized backdoors into your nonprofit: Delete company profiles, access accounts and security clearance for employees who are no longer with your organization.\nChange your passwords: Update your organization’s passwords and set procedures to have them regularly changed moving forward. \nImplementing nonprofit financial management practices for your organization \nExecuting nonprofit financial management practices in the real world is a difficult practice and it’s made all the more difficult when done alone. Between navigating the administrative difficulties of coordinating events and recruiting volunteers, nonprofits manage this noble work on what are often shoestring budgets that make success difficult and the risk of failure even greater. In the middle of that fight, it’s good to have someone in your corner.\nTo learn how Capital One Commercial Bank can help your business, click here.",

  "text": "Uncollected/held funds. We reserve the right to return and/or refuse to pay any check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal or other electronic item or instruction which is presented for payment against uncollected/held funds. If you have a commercial account, a fee may be deducted from the account for any item drawing against uncollected funds, whether the item is paid or returned unpaid, in accordance with our current Schedule of Fees and Charges.\nReturning items for insufficient funds. You do not have the right to write a check or draft, to make an ATM or other withdrawal, or to initiate or have an automatic debit processed against your account for an amount that exceeds your available balance (If you’re enrolled in an overdraft protection, we’ll transfer available amounts to cover the transaction in accordance with the agreement governing your overdraft protection plan). At any time before final payment (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) we may return any check, draft, image, negotiable order of withdrawal, electronic debit or other item presented for payment against your account when there are insufficient available funds in your account to pay the item or if for some other reason the item is not good or payable. In addition, we may charge a fee for each item returned in accordance with our current Schedule of Fees and Charges.\nOverdrafts. This section applies to consumer accounts. Business-purpose accounts may have different policies.\nWhat is an overdraft?\nAn overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a debit transaction, but we pay it anyway. Debit transactions include your checks, Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, bill payments, regularly scheduled repeating payments (like your mortgage or car payment) and other withdrawals you make.\nWhat overdraft services do we offer?\nFor all checking accounts, we will consider paying your checks, ACH (such as your mortgage payment), bill payments, withdrawals and recurring debit card transactions (like your monthly gym payment) into overdraft rather than returning the item unpaid.\nWe also offer an additional overdraft service that you can opt into. If you opt into this service we will also consider paying your everyday one-time debit card and ATM transactions.\nYou can also ask us to generally decline all transactions that would take your account into overdraft.\nRegardless of the overdraft service you have, sometimes we are required to pay a transaction that may create an overdraft in your account. Here are two examples of when this could happen:\nFor example, some merchants, like restaurants, hotels or gas stations—won’t know the exact amount of your purchase when they request the authorization. That transaction could come in for more money and we would need to pay it even if you don't have enough money in your account.\nOr sometimes we authorize a debit card purchase when you have funds in your account, but if the merchant does not submit it for payment right away, another transaction could come in first (while the original debit card purchase transaction is still pending). Then when that debit card transaction comes in for payment there are no longer enough funds in your account to cover it and the payment makes your balance negative.\nIn either case, you still won’t be charged a fee.\nYou can avoid overdrafts on your account by always making sure that you have sufficient funds in your account to cover all the transactions presented for payment.\nHow do we handle overdraft items?\nYou have no right to overdraw your account at any time, for any reason, and our decision to pay overdraft transactions is solely within our discretion. We may refuse to pay an overdraft transaction at any time, even though we may have previously paid overdrafts. If we choose to pay a transaction into overdraft, you must make a deposit into your account to cover the overdrawn amount. We will send you a notice to let you know that your account is overdrawn. You will receive the notice via mail if you have not agreed to receive electronic communications or if you have not provided us with a valid email address.\nWhen deciding to pay transactions that cause an overdraft, we consider a variety of factors, including the amount of the transaction and/or your history with us, including whether you’ve previously had too many overdrafts on your account(s).\nWhat else do you need to know?\nMaintaining a negative balance in your account for 56 consecutive calendar days will result in account closure and this could affect your ability to open new accounts with us or other banks in the future. Also, we may report the account closure to a consumer reporting agency.\nStop payment orders. You or any one of the signers on your account may request us to stop payment on a check written on your account by providing us with the account number and the check number or check range. You understand that unless we have complete and accurate information from you, we may be unable to identify the check for which a stop payment has been requested which will result in the check being paid. We also require a reasonable amount of time to act on the request. If two or more signatures are required to transact business, we may accept any ONE authorized signature for a stop payment order.\nUnder certain circumstances, current transaction information may not be available, and the item upon which a stop payment has been requested may already have been paid. If the item upon which you have stopped payment has already been paid, we will refund the stop payment fee at your request. Written stop payment orders expire after six (6) months. All stop payment orders entered by you through Teleservice24℠ expire six months from the date entered unless otherwise renewed by you in writing before they expire.\nUnless stop payment orders are renewed in writing, Capital One Bank assumes no responsibility if the item is paid after the expiration of the stop payment order. You will be charged a fee for initial and renewed stop payment orders.\nYou may not stop payment on a check that is used to purchase a Cashier’s Check, on the purchased Cashier’s Check (except as otherwise provided by applicable law), or on any item that has already cleared or has been paid.\nAutomated processing. In accordance with general banking standards, we have adopted automated collection and payment systems which rely on information encoded onto each check in magnetic ink. You agree that we may disregard all information on any check drawn on your account (front and back) other than your signature, the amount of the check and the information encoded in magnetic ink. You further agree that we shall not be deemed to have failed to exercise ordinary care in paying an item solely because our procedures do not require us to perform a sight examination of items with a face amount below a threshold level established by us from time to time.\nPost-dated checks. If you write a post-dated check, we may pay it and charge it against your account, even if it is presented prior to the date of the check.\nStale Checks. We are not obligated to pay a check presented for payment more than six months after its date (a “Stale Check”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree to hold us harmless if we pay a Stale Check. If you do not want us to pay a Stale Check, you must place a stop-payment order on the check.\nRestrictive legends. We are not required to honor any restrictive legend placed on checks you write. Examples of restrictive legends placed on checks are “must be presented within 90 days” or “not valid for more than $1000.00”. We are not responsible for any losses, claims, damages, or expenses that result from your placement of these or other special instructions on your checks.\nDrafts which do not bear your signature. If we receive a draft drawn against your account which does not contain your signature as reflected on the signature card for your account we may, at our discretion, return the draft unpaid. If you wish to ensure that a draft drawn against your account but not bearing your signature will be paid, you must communicate to us in advance that you want the draft to be paid.\nFacsimile signature/system-generated signatures. If you authorize us to honor any facsimile or system-generated signature, you have the sole responsibility for maintaining the security of each signature affixing device or system. No facsimile or system-generated signature shall be deemed to be an unauthorized signature notwithstanding the lack of authority of the person(s) affixing such signature, and you shall be solely responsible for any and all losses incurred in connection with the use of the facsimile or system-generated signature.\nChecks presented over the counter for payment by a non-customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that if a check drawn against your account is presented over-the-counter for payment by a person who is not a deposit customer of Capital One Bank we may, in our sole discretion, refuse payment of the check or charge a fee for payment of the check.\nPower of attorney. Power of attorney is a legal arrangement in which a person (the principal), authorizes another person (the agent/ attorney(s)-in-fact) to act on his or her behalf with respect to certain matters. Such matters may include banking, retirement benefits, real estate, insurance, and other transactions. If you want someone other than an authorized signer on your account to transact business on your account, you must provide us with a form reasonably acceptable to us which identifies the person to whom you grant your power of attorney and each account for which you wish the agent to exercise the power of attorney.\nWe have no duty or agreement whatsoever to monitor or insure that the acts of the agent are for your benefit. We may continue to honor the transactions of the agent until: (a) we have received written notice or have actual knowledge of the termination of the authority or the death of the principal, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice or knowledge. You agree not to hold us responsible for any loss or damage you may incur as a result of our following instructions given by an agent acting under a valid power of attorney.\nDeath or incompetence. If any person with a right to withdraw funds from your account(s) dies or becomes legally incompetent, we must be promptly notified. We may continue to honor your checks, items and instructions until (a) we know of your death or legal incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that we may pay checks drawn on or before the date of death or legal incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming interest in the account. We may restrict access to your account upon notice of your death or legal incompetence until the appropriate documentation is provided to us by your executor, administrator or other legal representative of your estate or person.\nGrant of security interest and right to set-off. To secure payment of any monies that you may owe us or any of our affiliates, for any reason, you grant us a continuing security interest in all funds that you may now and in the future maintain on deposit with us, with the exception of funds held in a trust or fiduciary account, or in an Individual Retirement Account, or in other qualified tax-deferred accounts. You agree that we may apply (set-off) funds that you maintain on deposit with Capital One Bank, or any of its affiliates, against any amount that you may then owe us, or any of our affiliates, under a loan, or Overdraft, or guaranty, or for any other reason at any time and without prior notice to you. This right of set off does not apply if the debt is created under a consumer credit card plan. We may set-off your account at any time whether or not you are then in default in making payment to us, and we may exercise our right of set-off without liability to you even if it results in an interest penalty or dishonor of subsequent checks and other items with respect to your account. You further agree that the foregoing right extends to any federal or state benefit payments (including Social Security benefits) electronically deposited into your account. You understand and agree that if you do not want your benefits to be subject to our right of set-off, you may change your direct deposit instructions by providing notice to the benefits payor at any time. You also agree that any federal benefits or other payments deposited to your account after you are no longer eligible to receive benefits must be returned to the federal government or other payor, and we may set-off against any of your accounts if we are obligated to return funds to the payor. Our right to set-off your account is in addition to any other rights and remedies that we may have under law or under any other contractual agreement.\nCollection expenses. You agree to pay and reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses in attempting to collect amounts that you owe us arising out of transactions on your account. This includes payment and reimbursement of fees we incur for collecting such amounts, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees (including our in-house attorneys) and court costs.\nAdverse claims. If we receive conflicting instructions with respect to your account, or notice of an adverse claim of ownership, right to control, or access to funds in your account, or notice that the funds in your account may have been obtained through fraudulent or criminal acts, you agree that if any such dispute exists, we may place a hold on the funds in your account and refuse to honor all withdrawal and transfer requests, including checks written on the account, until all appropriate parties provide us with joint specific written instructions with respect to disposition of the funds. We are not required to determine whether a dispute has merit. Additionally, we shall have the right to close the account and deposit the funds held in the account into the registry of a court of proper jurisdiction, wherein the adverse claimants and/or appropriate parties shall be interpleaded and/or joined to the action for purposes of resolving the dispute regarding the funds. If we elect to take any action(s) described herein, you agree that we shall not be liable to you for damages of any kind, and you agree to pay and reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees (including our in-house attorneys) and court costs from the funds in the account prior to any distribution. If an adverse claim is made among joint depositors, the rights of the parties shall be determined in accordance with the section herein entitled Special Rules for Multiple Party Deposit Accounts.\nLegal process against account. If your account is attached, garnished, or otherwise subject to levy or seizure, in whole or in part, by legal action, we shall not be liable to you for any sums we may be required to pay because of such attachment, garnishment, levy or seizure, even if paying the money from your account leaves insufficient funds to pay a check you have written. We can restrain your account regardless of the location of the account and the location of service. For example, if a New York levy is properly served on us in New York, we may honor the New York levy even if your account was opened in Virginia. You hereby authorize us to comply with legal process, and we are not required to determine whether the court issuing the legal process had jurisdiction over you or over the account or otherwise had the authority to issue the legal process. If we incur any expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney fees, in responding to an attachment, garnishment, levy, or seizure that are not otherwise reimbursed, we may charge such expenses to your account without prior notice to you. Any such attachment, garnishment, levy or seizure is subject to our right of offset. If we are served with a notice of proceeding relating to a safe deposit box, and you are not a named defendant in the proceeding, we may deny you access to the box unless otherwise directed by an appropriate court or the judgment creditor.\nUnclaimed property. The law establishes procedures under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable State. The applicable State is usually the State listed in the address on your account statement. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years. If your funds are surrendered to the State, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim must be presented to the State. Once your funds are surrendered, we no longer have any liability or responsibility with respect to the funds.\nClosing an account. We may close any account in our sole discretion at any time, for any or no reason and without notice to you. For example, we may close your account with no notice of action if the account has a zero balance. If we close your account with a balance, we will notify you of our action and either transfer the funds to another internal account owned by you or an external account through an approved link or send you a check for the collected balance in your account, less any amounts due to us for pending transactions. Capital One Bank is not liable for any damages or liabilities resulting from the termination of an account relationship. Subject to any rights we may have with respect to advance notice of withdrawal from your account, you may close your account at any time and for any reason. If we receive a debit or credit to your closed account, the account may be reopened to accept the debit or credit for you, even if doing so overdraws your account, and funds deposited therein will be subject to any and all rights we may have with respect to offset. If your account is overdrawn when we close it, you agree to promptly pay all amounts owed to us.\nMinor accounts. We may pay funds on deposit in an account in the name of a minor to the minor. Once the minor attains the age of majority he or she will be considered to be the owner of the account, capable of making any and all transactions on the account.\nBusiness accounts. If the account owner is not a natural person, such as a corporation, unincorporated association, limited liability company, partnership or any other entity holding an account in any capacity other than an individual capacity, and as may be required by Capital One Bank for the specific deposit account, each person who signs the signature card hereby certifies that they are fully authorized to execute all documents in their stated capacity. Additionally, and where applicable as set forth above, the individual who signs the signature card as Secretary hereby certifies that (1) she/he is the duly qualified Secretary or other authorized officer of the business entity identified on the signature card as the account holder; (2) such business entity is organized and existing under state or federal law; (3) all actions by shareholders, directors and all others necessary to execute this signature card and establish an account with Capital One Bank have been taken; and, (4) until further actual notice to Capital One Bank, each signer is authorized to transact on the account until Capital One Bank receives actual written notice in a form acceptable to us, executed by the number of Signers required to execute withdrawals on the account, and/or executed by others as required by us, that such Signer is no longer so authorized. To the extent a signature card is required for the specific deposit account, in the event any one or more of the signatures affixed to the front of this signature card, or otherwise provided to Capital One Bank as an authorized signature for the operation of this account, are facsimiles or made or reproduced by any mechanical means, Capital One Bank is authorized to rely upon and treat the same, in good faith, as a true and valid signature, and the account holder hereby holds Capital One Bank harmless and indemnifies it from and against any loss, damage or liability it may suffer or incur as a result of its said reliance.\nMultiple-signer business accounts. We are not required to comply with any multiple-signature requirement, even if your signature card specifies that multiple signatures are required or you have otherwise instructed us to do so. A multiple-signature requirement is for your internal control purposes.\nOnline account consolidation disclosure. If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will link your eligible accounts so they appear when you are logged into your account through the website or mobile app. We will display only summary information about your connected accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions, or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts. People with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nPayment processing restrictions on internet gambling fund transfers. The Federal Reserve recently enacted regulations that require U.S. financial firms that participate in designated payment systems to establish and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent payments connected to unlawful Internet gambling. In light of the regulations, please be informed that restricted transactions (as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG / 12 CFR Part 233) are prohibited from being processed directly or indirectly through any account or relationship maintained with us. Restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with unlawful Internet gambling.\nSpecific terms applicable to the following account ownerships\nJoint account – If two or more individuals are designated as owners of the accounts (without a fiduciary, beneficiary or other designation), then the account is a joint account and, unless your signature card states otherwise, all owners are considered to be joint tenants with right of survivorship. If there is more than one joint owner, the rights of survivorship will continue between the surviving joint owners. One joint owner is not authorized to remove another joint owner from the title of the joint account, but may withdraw all of the funds in the account or close the account.\nTrust — An account established pursuant to a written trust agreement. Any funds placed in or added to this type of account are conclusively presumed to be a delivery at that time to the trust estate. Only the trustee is authorized to perform transactions on the trust account. If the original trustee dies or is replaced as trustee, we reserve the right to require documentation reasonably acceptable to us to which identifies the successor trustee. We have no duty whatsoever for enforcing the terms of the trust agreement and can rely on the statements and representations made to us by the trustee. The owners and beneficiaries of the trust agree that we shall not be held liable if the trustee breaches their fiduciary duty or fails to comply with the terms of the trust agreement.\nUniform Transfers to Minors — This type of account is established pursuant to the Uniform Transfers/Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the state where the account is opened and maintained, as may be amended from time to time. Only the Custodian is authorized to act on the account. As the Custodian you agree to comply with all applicable laws. When the minor reaches the age of majority, in accordance with applicable state law, the Custodian shall transfer any funds in the account to the minor. In the event we receive actual notice of the death, resignation or legal incapacity of the Custodian, we are directed to deliver this account to the Successor Custodian (as provided by law) who shall, in such event, have all of the rights and duties of the Custodian.\n“Payable on Death” (POD) – You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nSpecial rules for multiple party deposit accounts\nIf your account was opened or assigned to a branch in New Jersey, the provisions of the Multiple Party Account Act, N.J.S.A. 17:16i-1 et seq. apply.\nWe may treat each co-owner of a joint account as having full and complete authority to make deposits into such account, to request information with respect to such account and to place a hold on such account. Each co-owner owns his/her net contribution to such account. In the absence of proof of net contribution, and unless all of the co-owners have specifically otherwise agreed, each co-owner will own an equal share of such account. We are not required to determine net contributions.\nDeposits: Each co-owner authorizes the other co-owners to endorse for deposit into the account any item payable to any or all of the co-owners, and you expressly authorize us to supply the endorsement of any co-owner necessary for such deposit.\nWithdrawals: \nYou authorize us to recognize the signature, oral or electronic instruction of any co-owner for withdrawals, payments or funds transfer. We are not required to enforce multiple signature requirements that you may have agreed upon among yourselves.\nWe may continue to honor checks and withdrawal requests by any co-owner without liability to any other co-owner unless we receive written notice signed by one of you not to honor checks or withdrawals against the joint account. After we receive such a notice, we may require written authorization from all of you for any checks or withdrawals. If we receive a notice in writing as provided by this section 3(b), we shall be relieved of responsibility to each and every co-owner for failure or refusal to honor any check, draft or other demand for payment or withdrawal unless the action is authorized by all co-owners in writing.\nWithout notice to any party, we may withdraw or hold any or all of the money in the joint account and apply funds withdrawn to reduce any indebtedness of any party due and owing to Capital One Bank. A notice sent, mailed or delivered to any party constitutes notice to all.\nWe may make payment from the joint account, including payment of the entire account balance: (i) pursuant to any statutory or common law right of set-off, levy, attachment, or other valid legal process or court order, relating to the interest of any one or more of the co-owners or (ii) on request, to a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver in any state or federal insolvency proceeding or other duly authorized insolvency representative of any one or more of the co-owners.\nOverdrafts: In the event that we pay a check drawn on a joint account and that payment causes an Overdraft, each party to that joint account will be jointly and severally liable to us for the amount of that Overdraft without regard to which party signed the check or for what purpose the proceeds of the check were used.\nDeath of a party: You agree to notify us of the death of any joint owner and to reimburse us for any tax we must pay by reason of our payment or release of funds in the account to you. Unless your signature card states otherwise, upon the death of any account owner, the funds in a multiple-owner account shall belong to the surviving owner(s). We reserve the right to hold funds in the account until we receive documentation satisfactory to us, proving death and/or directing the disposition of such funds.\nIf you want to change the form of your account, you must notify us in writing, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the branch where your account is maintained. If you wish to alter the form of an account, the altered form must be an account offered by Capital One Bank and written notice must be made by the proper completion of a document approved by Capital One Bank and delivery of that document to us. Written notice is not effective until received by us. You must also provide us with new completed signature cards within thirty (30) days from the date you forwarded written notice to us.\nWe will be protected from liability for all payments made from the multiple party deposit account, when made in accordance with applicable law.\nLimitations on assignment and transfer of ownership. You may not assign or transfer ownership of your deposit accounts with us without obtaining our prior written approval. In addition, you may not grant a security interest in funds held in your deposit accounts in favor of any other creditor without obtaining our prior written approval, which we have the right to withhold for any or no reason. If any ownership interest in an account is proposed to be transferred or if there is any change in account title, we may require that the account be closed and a new account be opened.\nDeposit availability disclosure\nGeneral deposit availability:\nOur general policy is to make funds from your deposits available to you on the first business day after the day we receive your deposits. Wire Transfers, and electronic deposits (such as ACH credit transfer direct deposits) will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once funds are available, you may withdraw the funds in cash, and we will use the funds to pay checks that you have written. For the purpose of determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. Banking office cutoff times may vary, but in no event shall a cutoff time be earlier than 2:00 p.m. local time. If you make a deposit in a branch before 2:00 p.m. local time, or such later time posted at the branch of deposit on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. If you make a deposit at one of our automated teller machines (“ATM”) before 9:00 p.m. ET, we will consider the deposit to be made that day. However, if you make a deposit after these stated times, or on a day we are not open, we will consider the deposit to be made on the next business day that we are open. Deposits made through our night drop after 7:00 a.m. may be processed on the next business day.\nPlease remember that even after we have made deposited funds available to you, and you have withdrawn the funds, you are still responsible for checks you deposit that are returned to us unpaid and for any other problems involving your deposit. If you have any questions, contact a banking officer.\nGovernment checks and cashier’s checks:\nFunds from the following deposits are available on the first business day after the day of your deposit: U.S. Treasury Checks, USPS Money Orders, Federal Reserve Bank & Federal Home Loan Bank checks; and when deposited with a special deposit slip, State or Local government checks, Cashier’s, Certified, Teller’s and Travelers checks.\nLonger delays may apply:\nIn some cases, we will not make all of the funds you deposit by check available to you on the first business day after the day of your deposit. Funds may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. The first $225 of your deposits, however, may be available on the first business day after the day of your deposit. If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first business day, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the day after we receive your deposit.\nIf you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available.\nIn addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:\nWe believe the check you are depositing will not be paid.\nYou deposit checks totaling more than $5,525 on any day to any account(s) you maintain (alone or with others) at Capital One Bank.\nYou redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid.\nYou have overdrawn your account(s) repeatedly in the last six months.\nThere is an emergency, such as failure of computer or communications equipment.\nWe will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. The funds will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.\nSpecial rules for new accounts:\nIf you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first thirty (30) days your account is open:\nFunds from wire transfers and electronic deposits (such as ACH credit transfer direct deposits) will be available on the day we receive the deposit.\nFunds from the following deposits are available on the first business day after the day of your deposit: U.S. Treasury Checks, USPS Money Orders, Federal Reserve Bank & Federal Home Loan Bank checks; and when deposited with a special deposit slip, State or Local government checks, Cashier’s, Certified, Teller’s and Travelers checks.\nFunds from all other check deposits will be available no later than the fifth business day after the day of your deposit.\nExpedited availability:\nBased on your overall relationship with us, we may make a portion of your check deposits available to you on an expedited basis. We will periodically reevaluate the usage and handling of your account based on your customer history with Capital One Bank. This review could result in reducing the availability schedule currently applied to your check deposits. In the event of such a reduction, your funds will be made available to you as described in the preceding sections of this disclosure.\nAs described above, deposits made after the branch and/or ATM cut-off time will be considered next day deposits. In some instances, however, you may be able to access these deposits on the calendar day the deposit was made. In these instances, the funds will be accessible to you for withdrawal (at a branch or ATM), but will not be available to pay incoming ACH transactions or checks you have written.\nHolds on other funds (check cashing):\nIf we cash a check for you that is drawn on another bank, we may withhold the availability of a corresponding amount of funds that are already in your account. (These funds will be available at the time that funds from the check we cashed would have been available if you had deposited the check.)\nHolds on other funds (other accounts):\nIf we accept for deposit a check that is drawn on another bank, we may make funds from the deposit available for withdrawal immediately but delay your availability to withdraw a corresponding amount of funds that you have on deposit in another account with us. The funds in the other account would then not be available for withdrawal until the time periods that are described elsewhere in this disclosure. Please ask a Relationship Banker if you are unsure about when funds from a deposit will be available.\nSubstitute checks and your rights\nFederal rules for Check 21 allow banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks”. Below are the details and your rights:\nWhat is a substitute check?\nTo make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks.” These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check.\nSome or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other law with respect to those transactions.\nWhat are my rights regarding substitute checks?\nIn certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from your account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, bounced check fees).\nThe amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law. If you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business days after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar days after we received your claim.\nWe may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account.\nHow do I make a claim for a refund?\nIf you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact your local branch or call us at 1-800-262-5689. You must contact us within 40 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances.\nYour claim must include:\nA description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect);\nAn estimate of the amount of your loss;\nAn explanation of why the substitute check you received is insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss; and\nA copy of the substitute check and/or the following information to help us identify the substitute check: the account number, the check number, the name of the person to whom you wrote the check, the date paid, and the amount of the check.\nSubstitute checks should only be generated by banks during the check collection process. If you deposit a substitute check that was not generated or previously handled by Capital One Bank, you agree to provide the substitute check warranties as required by Check 21, and represent that the substitute check:\nis properly generated and accurately, clearly and completely represents all the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated\nbears a MICR encoded line that is suitable for automated processing in the same manner as the original check\nhas not previously been paid by the drawee bank, and\nis not fraudulent\nA breach of any Check 21 warranty may result in the substitute check being charged back against your account.\nTelephone solicitation. If you provide our routing number and your account number to a telephone solicitor pursuant to your acceptance of an offer of goods or services made by the solicitor, you agree that any and all subsequent transactions made to your account by the entity which the solicitor represents are considered authorized transactions. We shall not be liable for any transactions you later allege are unauthorized unless you have placed a stop payment order, and we have had a reasonable time to act upon your stop payment request.\nCommunications. You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us), and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nCorrespondents. Capital One Bank may forward items to correspondent banks and will not be liable for the wrongful conduct of the correspondent bank. Each correspondent will be liable only for its own negligence. We will not be liable for the loss of items in transit.\nAddress changes for deposit accounts governed by this document1. You are responsible for notifying us of any change in your address. Your Privacy and Security is important to us so having the most current address on file is required. Unless we agree otherwise, changes of address must be made online, over the phone, or in a branch by at least one of the account holders. Informing us of your address on a check reorder form is not sufficient. We will attempt to communicate with you only by use of the most recent address you have provided to us. In the event mail we attempt to deliver to you is returned as a result of your failure to notify us of your change in address, we may charge a fee to your account in accordance with our Schedule of Fees and Charges.\nWe may change your postal address of record if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service or if we receive information from a third party vendor in the business of providing correct addresses, that our records no longer correspond to your address.\n1 For example, if you have a line of credit with us or a 360 checking account, please follow the account agreement given to you.\nCash transaction reporting. The law requires all financial institutions to gather and report information on certain types of cash transactions. If the information required to complete the report is not provided, we are required to refuse to process the transaction.\nObtaining credit reports. We may request a consumer (credit) report in connection with your account(s). Upon your request, you will be informed whether or not a consumer (credit) report was requested, and if such report was requested, informed of the name and address of the consumer (credit) reporting agency that furnished the report. We may also request subsequent consumer (credit) reports for all legitimate purposes in connection with updating, renewing, reviewing, modifying, and/or taking collection action on your account(s).\nReporting information to credit bureaus and check verification systems. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus and/or check verification systems. Defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. This could affect your ability to open accounts in the future.\nIn the event we report your account to a check verification system, you acknowledge that even if you pay us all amounts owed, we are not required to remove an accurate report of account mishandling from any such check verification system.\nBusiness day. Any day, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays.\nReproduction of bank records. If you request us to research and/or reproduce any of your records (statements, checks, deposits, withdrawals, etc.) we may charge a fee, and you agree to pay this fee. If the expected fee is large, you may be asked to pay the fee in advance. We reserve the right to provide any account holder with an imaged item in lieu of the original item.\nGoverning law/waiver of jury trial. Applicable federal law will decide any questions under these Rules, or if no federal law exists, applicable state law (the state where your account was established). Any action you commence against us, arising out of or concerning these Rules, shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury.

We shall deem any and all notices to us effective upon receipt by us. Any notice that we give to you will be effective when mailed or electronically transmitted to you at the mailing/email address reflected in our records. Even though we may have provided you account opening disclosures in a language other than English, we may continue to provide you with notices/communications in English. Notice to any one owner of an account constitutes notice to all owners of that account.\nSeverability. If any provision of these Rules is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Rules or of any agreements, disclosures or other documents incorporated by reference herein.\nLiability. You agree that we shall be not be liable for acting upon your instructions or failing to act upon your instructions when we reasonably believe that doing so would expose us to civil or criminal liability or conflict with industry standard banking practices. You agree further, that except as otherwise provided by applicable law, in no event shall we be liable for indirect, special or consequential damages or for attorney’s fees incurred by you, regardless of the form of the action, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nWaiver of rights. We reserve the right to waive any one or more of our rights hereunder in our sole discretion, however, any such waiver shall only apply to that specific instance. Any such waiver of rights can also be terminated at any time, in our sole discretion.\nCaption headings. The caption headings in these Rules are for convenience purposes only and are not to be construed as a summary of each provision of these Rules.\nPrivacy Policy. We understand how important privacy and confidentiality are to you.

Special provisions relating to electronic funds transfers are set forth in our EFT Disclosure which is available at any of our banking offices.\nWire and ACH transfers. Special provisions relating to wire transfers are set forth in our Wire Transfer Agreement and Disclosure, provided to you at account opening and available at any of our banking offices. For Treasury Management clients, ACH and Wire transfer terms are set forth in the applicable Treasury Management agreements. This provision supplements those agreements. You agree that we are not required to provide you with a separate notice of incoming or outgoing wire/ACH transfers. We notify you by listing the wire/ACH transfer on your account statement. We can deduct our fees for handling wire/ACH transfers from the amount of the transfer. You can verify whether a wire/ACH transfer has been processed to your account by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nFor international wire transfers involving non-U.S. currencies, exchange rates can vary and we do not guarantee any rate. The exchange rates we use for your transactions will typically be the customary retail exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction. This rate is not necessarily the bank-to-bank negotiated exchange rate or other potentially more favorable rate. FDIC deposit insurance does not insure against any loss due to foreign currency fluctuations. Consult your attorney or investment advisor regarding the potential risks associated with foreign exchange transactions.\nReal-Time Payments (RTP). You agree that we are not required to provide you with a separate notice of incoming RTP payments. We notify you by listing the RTP payment on your account statement.\nAmendments and fee changes. We reserve the right to change our fees, these Rules and any or all of the agreements, disclosures, and other documents incorporated by reference at any time. If we change these Rules, the then-current version of these Rules supersedes all prior versions and contains the terms governing your account. We will provide prior notice of changes to you as required by applicable law. You agree that continued use of your account(s) will constitute your agreement to any and all new fees, Rules, agreements, disclosures and other documents incorporated by reference. If you choose to close your account and do so prior to the effective date of any amendment, you will not be bound by such amendment.\nCopy received. You acknowledge receipt of a copy of these terms and conditions and agree to be bound by them.\nElectronic Fund Transfer Agreement and disclosure for personal and commercial accounts\nEffective February 9, 2022\nWelcome to Capital One, N.A. (hereinafter referred to as “Capital One Bank,” “us,” “our,” or “we”). In this Agreement, “you,” “your,” and “yours” mean the authorized person or persons who conduct electronic fund transfers, including but not limited to persons to whom a Capital One Bank ATM or Debit Card is issued. Capital One Bank provides various electronic banking services to you. These services include, but are not limited to:\nAutomated Teller Machine (“ATM”) transactions.\nTelephone transfers.\nPoint-of-Sale (“POS”) transactions, whether or not initiated through an electronic terminal.\nPre-authorized transfers to or from an account (“ACH”).\nSmartphone or other mobile device transfers.\nOnline banking (see the Online Banking Terms and Conditions at www.capitalone.com/corporate/terms/).\nThis Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement and Disclosure (“Agreement”) contains disclosures required by Regulation E that apply to consumer accounts in addition to disclosures that apply to commercial accounts as they relate to electronic banking services, and it contains our terms and conditions with respect to these services. A consumer account is an account held by an individual and used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\nYour access device and your Personal Identification Number: An access device is a card, personal identification number (\"PIN\"), or other code used to initiate an electronic fund transfer (\"EFT\") to or from your account. The Capital One Bank, ATM card, platinum Debit Card, or Business Debit Card (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"ATM/Debit Card\") that you have requested is an access device.\nYou have selected or have been provided with a special PIN, a code you must enter into the ATM or that you may be required to enter into the POS terminal whenever you use your ATM/Debit Card. For your own protection, please memorize the PIN, and do not keep any notation of the PIN on the ATM/Debit Card or in the same wallet or purse as the ATM/Debit Card, and do not disclose the PIN to anyone who is not authorized to use your ATM/Debit Card.\nImportant information concerning international use of your ATM or Debit Card: Capital One Bank employs fraud monitoring and protection capabilities to help protect you from ATM/Debit Card fraud. These protection systems are designed to block transactions that occur outside of our customers’ ordinary transaction patterns and may block transactions originating in countries that are experiencing a high incidence of card fraud.\nAccounts that may be accessed: The accounts you link to your ATM/Debit Card are referred to in this Agreement as \"designated accounts.\" You may access only the designated accounts. If you requested access to multiple accounts, you chose one checking account and one savings account as your primary checking and savings accounts. We may limit the number of accounts that can be linked to an ATM/Debit Card. If you wish to access additional accounts or change your primary accounts, please contact your banking officer.\nYou may use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN to access the following types of designated accounts:\nChecking account.\nNOW account.\nSavings account.\nMoney Market account*\n* At certain ATMs, when accessing your Money Market accounts you may need to select the ‘checking’ option rather than the ‘savings’ option.\nTypes of transactions that can be completed: You may use your ATM/Debit Card at any Capital One Bank ATM. You may also use your ATM/Debit Card to complete transactions at non-Capital One Bank ATMs that are members of the EFT networks in which we participate.\nPurchases may also be made using your ATM/Debit Card at merchant locations that are members of the POS networks in which we participate. You may also use your Debit Card or Business Debit Card to make purchases at locations that accept Debit MasterCard™ Cards. (Note: Your Debit Card or your Business Debit Card is not a MasterCard credit card, and this Agreement does not replace or affect any MasterCard account agreement that you may have with us or any other financial institution.)\nPlease note that some of the below services may not be available at all ATMs.\nCash withdrawals: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at ATMs to obtain cash withdrawals from your designated accounts. At certain ATMs, cash withdrawals may only be made from your primary savings and primary checking account. Withdrawals made at ATMs owned and operated by other entities will be automatically deducted from your designated primary checking or savings account. Each time you use your ATM/Debit Card, we may place a hold on a corresponding amount of funds in your account until the transaction is posted against your account.\nDeposits: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at Capital One Bank-branded ATMs to make deposits into your designated accounts. Deposits made at an ATM may not be available for immediate withdrawal. Please refer to the Deposit Availability Disclosure contained in our Rules Governing Deposit Accounts Agreement to determine when the deposit will be credited to your account and when funds will be available for withdrawal or for paying transactions on your account.\nTransfers between your Capital One accounts: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at a Capital One Bank-branded ATM to transfer available funds between your designated accounts. Transfers made at a non-Capital One Bank ATM can only be made between your designated primary checking and primary savings accounts.\nYou may also transfer funds between your Capital One Bank accounts via the telephone, online banking, or by establishing an automatic transfer schedule.\nPurchases: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN to make purchases at merchant locations that are members of POS networks in which we participate.\nYou may also use your ATM/Debit Card without your PIN to make purchases at merchant locations accepting Debit MasterCard Cards. The merchant may request a preauthorization for the transaction. If we authorize the transaction, the funds will be debited from your primary checking account immediately, or a hold may be placed on your account for up to several days after the purchase transaction has occurred, depending upon the promptness with which the merchant processes your transaction.\nSome purchases may result in a longer hold. Sometimes the preauthorization requests may be in amounts different from the total amount of the transaction. For example, a gas station typically requests authorization in the amount of $1.00. Also, restaurants typically request authorization for 20% more than the price of the meal. If the preauthorization request varies from the amount of the actual transaction, payment of the transaction may not remove the preauthorization hold immediately. Generally, the preauthorization hold may remain on your account for up to three (3) business days after the date of the transaction and may affect the availability of funds from your designated account for other transactions. We will not be responsible for damages for wrongful dishonor of an item resulting from a preauthorization hold. You agree not to withdraw, write checks, or make point-of-sale purchases against funds that are needed to pay ATM/Debit Card transactions that have not yet posted against your account.\nInquiries: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at ATMs to check the balance in your designated accounts. At non-Capital One Bank ATMs, you may only make balance inquiries on your designated primary checking or savings account. You may also check the balance in your designated accounts via our telephone or online banking service.\nTransfers between your Capital One Bank accounts and accounts at other financial institutions (or third parties) and check conversion: You can authorize a third party to initiate transfers between your accounts and the third party’s accounts by providing the third party with our routing number and your account number.\nYou may also authorize a merchant or other payee to make a one-time electronic payment from your checking account using information from your check to: (i) pay for purchases, or (ii) pay bills.\nWhen you provide a check as payment, you authorize us to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account. In certain circumstances, such as for technical or processing reasons, we may process your payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account on the same day you make your payment.\nYou should only provide your financial institution and account information (whether over the phone, the Internet, or via some other method) to trusted third parties whom you have authorized to initiate electronic fund transfers.\nLimitations on Transactions: There are certain limitations on the use of electronic banking services. These include, but are not limited to, the following: \nDesignated accounts: You may only access your designated accounts with Capital One Bank.\nDaily limitation: A daily spending limitation exists on all ATM/Debit Cards. This limitation combines three categories: cash withdrawals, cash advances and point-of-sale purchases. You may not aggregate transactions during any one (1) day (including either cash withdrawals, purchases, cash advances or a combination of the three) that exceed the established card limit. See the chart below for the limits established for the card product that you have. The limits listed below are the current default limits for our standard ATM/Debit Card products. Some cards might have different prevailing limits for their product at time of issuance. We do offer specialty ATM/Debit Cards with different default limits. If you have received a Wealth Management debit card or a Deposit Only ATM card, please refer to the documentation you received when you opened your account for details about limits for these cards.",

  "text": "February 6, 2024 |9 min read\nCredit card fraud is the most common type of identity theft, according to data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nThe good news is that if this happens to you, there are steps to follow. And when reported, the impact of credit card fraud can be limited.\nKey takeaways\nVictims of credit card fraud should report it immediately to their card issuer.\nAn individual’s credit scores may be affected if fraudulent activity isn’t reported and bills go unpaid.\nChecking bills and credit reports regularly can help you identify potential fraudulent activity.\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act limits cardholders’ liability for unauthorized charges to $50.\nSome issuers, including Capital One, offer $0 liability for unauthorized charges.\nWhat is credit card fraud? \nCredit card fraud is a form of identity theft that occurs when someone uses another person’s credit card or credit card information to buy something or access an account without permission. The scammer doesn’t need to actually have the physical card to commit this type of fraud.\nCredit card fraud sometimes gets confused with credit card disputes. A dispute may occur when a cardholder doesn’t agree with how a company has used their card—but has still given them permission to use it. Generally, this isn’t considered credit card fraud. This applies even if a scammer has persuaded someone to purchase something with their credit card. In other words, if the cardholder has authorized the purchase—even under false pretenses—it may not be credit card fraud.\nBecause the process for disputing a charge is different from reporting fraud, cardholders need to be clear about whether they’re dealing with fraud or a dispute.\nTypes of credit card fraud \nCredit card fraud can take many different forms, and it’s getting more sophisticated all the time. Here are some common types:\nCard-not-present (CNP) fraud \nCNP fraud is committed over the phone or online when a scammer has the card details but not the physical card. This information could have been bought on the dark web—or could have been acquired through a phishing scam or data breach.\nCredit card skimming \nCredit card skimming occurs when someone creates a fake—or cloned—card using someone else’s information. Thieves place a device called a skimmer over the card slot on an ATM or other card reader, like at a gas pump. When you slide your card through the slot, the skimmer reads and stores all your data. Thankfully, cards that come equipped with EMV chips make it more difficult for scammers to create duplicate cards.\nCredit card application or account fraud \nFraudsters often get a hold of personal information by dumpster diving, skimming or stealing mail. With details like your home address, Social Security number and birth date, they might be able to access your credit card account or apply for a new card in your name.\nLost or stolen card fraud \nLost or stolen card fraud is an old-school credit fraud method. It can happen when a fraudster uses a card that someone has lost, whether they dropped it in the street, had it stolen in the mail or were pickpocketed.\nSigns of credit card fraud \nHere are some common signs to look for if you suspect credit card fraud:\nUnfamiliar transactions on monthly credit card statements\nSmall account charges, which hackers sometimes use to avoid detection\nBlocked access to an account \nChanges to a credit report that weren’t authorized, like new credit accounts or unfamiliar addresses\nUnexpected calls from creditors or collection agencies\nHow to report credit card fraud \nThe sooner credit card fraud is detected and reported, the quicker you can stop any unauthorized spending in your name. That can help protect your credit scores and limit your liability for any fraudulent charges.\nWhen credit card fraud—including credit card theft, unauthorized purchases and suspicious activity—is suspected, it should be reported immediately using these steps:\n1. Confirm the charges are fraudulent \nIf you’ve noticed one or more charges on your account you don’t recognize, you can follow these steps before reporting credit card fraud:\nGo back through your receipts to remind yourself where you’ve been, what you’ve bought and how much you’ve spent.\nLook up the merchant online to see if it has a parent company or a business name different from the one you know. That name might be the one that’s on your bill.\nCheck with any family members or friends authorized to use the account to make sure they didn’t make the transactions in question.\nYou could also set up instant purchase notifications in the Capital One Mobile app to monitor your account. You can enable notifications that include the amount of the purchase and information about the merchant.\n2. Contact the card issuer immediately \nIf you suspect credit card fraud, you should contact your credit card issuer immediately to report it. The issuer will then begin a fraud investigation where they will collect any necessary information to make their assessment.\nIf fraud is suspected, the card will likely be locked so that no one else can use it. You can also freeze your card directly through most credit card mobile apps. \nAs part of the process, the existing credit card will likely be canceled and a replacement card with a new number will be issued. \nIf you still have the physical card, you can call the toll-free number on the back of the card. If you don’t have it, you can also contact your card issuer by letter or email. \nMany companies also offer fraud reporting directly through their app or website.\n3. Set up a fraud alert with a credit bureau \nSetting up a credit card fraud alert with a credit bureau makes it harder for anyone to change the details of any existing credit accounts or to open new ones. When in place, a fraud alert requires potential lenders to verify the identity of the applicant before creating any new accounts in their name.\nTo set up a fraud alert, you only need to contact one of the three major credit bureaus—Equifax®, Experian® or TransUnion®. The bureau contacted will then alert the other two. The alert can also be canceled at any time.\nCredit freezes are a similar option. But they require you to set up a freeze at each individual bureau.\n4. Consider filing an FTC complaint \nFiling a report through the FTC at Identitytheft.gov can assist law enforcement agents in their investigation and in recovering any stolen belongings. The FTC refers any reports made to the relevant authorities and offers resources to help get victims back on track.\nHow to prevent credit card fraud \nTaking the steps above could help victims of credit card fraud. But there are also ways to prevent it from happening. Here are some tips from the FBI and the FTC to help prevent credit card fraud:\nEnable notifications and security features. Instant purchase notifications may help you keep track of spending in real time. Plus, fraud alerts and card lock features can help you spot unusual or suspicious charges or allow you to lock your card. Capital One customers can access and enable security features by adding the Capital One Mobile app to their phone or by signing in to their account online.\nKeep your account information secure. Don’t give account information over the phone without confirming that the caller is who they say they are. \nSecure the physical cards. Never lend a credit card to anyone, and shred any old cards, statements and receipts. Wallets or purses should also be closely guarded when out in public, and never leave them unattended.\nWatch out for suspicious behavior. Stay alert during any transaction that requires handing over a credit card. And don’t place your card into any card-reading device that seems unusual. This could include the device being loose, crooked or damaged.\nReview your statements and credit reports regularly. Save receipts to compare them with monthly statements, and make sure that everything looks correct. It’s also a good idea to check your credit reports as often as you can and question anything you don’t recognize.\nBe cautious when making online purchases. Be on the lookout for phishing scams that require opening a link or an attachment or ones that ask for money or personal information. And consider using virtual card numbers to help protect your credit card account for online transactions.\nMonitor your credit score. CreditWise from Capital One lets you monitor your credit score and receive alerts when something changes on your credit report. This can help you see potential fraud quickly. CreditWise also offers free dark web monitoring. And it’s free for everyone, not just Capital One cardholders.\nCredit card fraud FAQ \nHere are some of the most commonly asked questions about credit card fraud:\nAm I liable for fraudulent charges made to my card?\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act limits cardholders’ liability for unauthorized charges to $50. And as long as fraudulent charges are reported, many credit card companies won’t hold a cardholder responsible at all.\nCapital One, for example, offers $0 liability for unauthorized charges.\nCan credit card fraud affect credit scores?\nRemember: Many credit card companies won’t hold a cardholder responsible for reported fraudulent charges made to the account. But if it goes undetected or unreported, credit card fraud can negatively impact an individual’s credit scores.\nIs credit card fraud a felony?\nIn some cases, credit card fraud can be a federal felony. Under state law, it can depend on the state in which the crime is committed and the total amount of the fraudulent charges. \nPenalties for credit card fraud include imprisonment, fines and more.\nHow is credit card fraud investigated?\nDuring a credit card fraud investigation, card issuers may contact the merchant who authorized the transaction in question to get more information. This could also involve requesting police reports and receipts to compare signatures. \nThe card issuer must respond within 30 days of receiving a report, but the investigation can take up to 90 days. During this time, you won’t have to pay for the disputed charges, and you won’t get charged interest on them, either.\nCredit card fraud in a nutshell \nWhen someone steals your credit card or credit card information to make fraudulent purchases, it can impact your overall financial health. That’s why working to prevent credit card fraud is important. \nWhile the law and credit card issuers may be there to help, it’s still a good idea to be careful. Cardholders can learn the signs of fraud and act quickly to report suspected fraud and prevent it from happening.\nAnd there are many ways to help keep your credit cards safe from fraudsters. These include enabling your card’s security features, shredding old credit cards when you get new ones and not sharing account information over the phone. You can also use virtual card numbers to protect your credit card account for online transactions.",

  "text": "March 14, 2024 |6 min read\nIf you’ve shopped online, you’ve likely had to give your credit card information, including your card verification value (CVV) number, to make a purchase.\nA CVV is a security code that helps protect you from credit card fraud like identity theft. Keep reading to learn where you can find your CVV number, why your CVV number is important and how to help keep your online payments secure.\nA CVV number helps protect your card from unauthorized purchases.\nA CVV is different from a personal identification number (PIN). A CVV is typically used for online or phone transactions, and a PIN is often for in-person payments or using your debit card at an ATM.\nTo find your card’s CVV, look for a three-digit number on the back of the card or a four-digit number on the front of the card.\nWhat is a CVV on a credit card? \nA CVV code is a three- or four-digit number on a credit or debit card that helps prevent credit card fraud. It’s meant to protect cardholders from unauthorized transactions by providing a second layer of protection.\nA CVV number is also known by other names, including: \nCard security code (CSC)\nCard verification code (CVC)\nCard validation code 2 (CVC2)\nCard identification number (CID)\nWhat’s the difference between a CVV and a CVV2? \nYou may also see a CVV referred to as a CVV2. CVV2 is one of the various forms of CVV that are used to protect your account against unauthorized transactions.\nWhere to find your card’s CVV code \nLike your credit card number and expiration date, your CVV number often appears directly on your card. But its exact placement depends on the network.\nFor Visa®, Mastercard® and Discover® cards, the CVV is a three-digit number, and it usually appears on the back of the card, typically next to the signature box. American Express cards have four-digit CVV numbers, and they appear on the front of the card.\nWhy is a CVV number important and how can it protect you? \nYour CVV number adds another layer of protection to help you avoid credit card fraud. It’s a way for the merchant to confirm that the cardholder is the one using the card. And with credit card fraud being the most common type of identity theft, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it can play an important role in protecting your credit card information. \nThe Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council states that CVV numbers are considered sensitive authentication data. Merchants are required to protect the information and delete the CVV number after the purchase is authorized. \nKeep in mind that not all online merchants require you to provide your CVV number to make purchases. And a CVV may not protect you in all cases of credit card fraud.\nHow to protect your CVV code and credit card number \nMaking sure that your CVV and credit card number are safe at all times is important. Capital One has a variety of credit card security features to help you protect yourself. And there are always additional measures you can take:\n1. Be careful when saving your credit card or debit card information \nSaving your credit card or debit card information online might make checkout a breeze. But it could also lead to unauthorized purchases if your account is compromised. Consider adding an extra layer of protection by using virtual card numbers. They’re still linked to your credit card account, but they let you use a different number to fill out online payment information.\n2. Only shop with legitimate online merchants and websites \nIt goes without saying that there are illegitimate businesses on the internet. Steering clear of sharing your information with sites that you’re wary of goes a long way. If you’re making a purchase, be sure the site has an “s” after “http” (e.g., https://) in its URL—or a lock icon before the URL. Those are signs that the site is secure and data is encrypted.\n3. Watch out for phishing attempts \nHave you ever received a random text message that looked like a scam? Or maybe you received a strange call asking for personal information. Those were likely types of phishing scams. \nWhether they come in the form of an email, text message or phone call, try to beware of scams. And never share your personal information or click on any links you believe are fraudulent.\nThe FTC also recommends following these best practices:\nUnless you’re sure the caller is who they say they are, don’t give your account information over the phone. If you’re not sure, you could consider calling the organization directly instead.\nDon’t lend your card to anyone.\nUse multifactor authentication to help protect your accounts, if possible.\nMonitor your account often for any suspicious activity.\nSave your receipts to compare them with your monthly statement.\nWhen it’s time to get rid of old cards, statements and receipts, make sure you’re careful about how you get rid of them.\nIf you’re a Capital One cardholder, you can access and enable security features through the Capital One Mobile app or by signing in to your account online.\nCVV code FAQ \nLearn more about CVVs with the answers to these frequently asked questions:\nCVV stands for card verification value. You may also see it referred to as CVV2, CSC, CVC, CVC2 or CID.\nCVV numbers are issued based on numerous factors, including:\nAccount number\nExpiration date\nCard network\nWhat’s the difference between a CVV and a PIN?\nYour CVV and PIN aren’t the same. Your CVV is used to verify your identity and make more secure purchases online or over the phone. Your PIN is used to help verify your identity when you use your debit card at an ATM or for in-person purchases. Credit cards may also issue PINs for cash advances.\nDoes a CVV code guarantee protection from credit card fraud?\nA CVV code can make it more difficult for a would-be scammer to steal all the information needed to complete a fraudulent transaction online. Still, a CVV code can’t guarantee protection from credit card fraud. So it’s still important to protect your personal information and never share your financial details with anyone you don’t trust.\nCredit card CVVs in a nutshell \nAlthough CVV codes offer a level of protection, they can’t guarantee your information stays secure. Like other account information, be sure to keep your CVV private. If you’re worried about credit card fraud, remember to be cautious while shopping online—and know how to spot and avoid scams. \nAnother way you can help protect yourself is to regularly monitor your credit. Get free copies of your credit reports by visiting AnnualCreditReport.com. A great way to do this is by using CreditWise from Capital One. With CreditWise, you can access your free TransUnion® credit report and VantageScore® 3.0 credit score without hurting your score. Plus, it’s free and available to everyone, whether or not you’re a Capital One cardholder.",

  "text": "August 6, 2024 |7 min read\nAs technology continues to evolve, devices like smartphones, smartwatches, laptops and tablets have become helpful for completing a range of everyday tasks with just a few clicks. And that includes making purchases without needing your physical credit card. One way to do this is by using a digital wallet.\nLearn more about what digital wallets are, how they work and how they can simplify your money management.\nDigital wallets are electronic versions of your physical wallet and allow you to pay for things without using physical cards or cash.\nPopular digital wallets include Apple Pay®, Venmo, Google Pay™ and PayPal®, among others.\nYou can use your digital wallet to pay in stores, online and within apps for convenience where you shop. \nCapital One users can link their credit card or debit card to their digital wallets to make on-the-go purchases faster and more securely.\nWhat is a digital wallet? \nDigital wallets are apps or online services that allow you to make transactions electronically. You may access a digital wallet on your phone, laptop or other compatible electronic devices. \nYour digital wallet can often hold your debit cards, credit cards, loyalty cards, or even concert and airline tickets. This makes it easier for you to access funds and information you need when you need them. Plus, it can eliminate the clutter of several plastic cards and speed up transactions with a simple tap, click or swipe of your finger. \nDigital wallet vs. mobile wallet \nThe terms “digital wallet” and “mobile wallet” are often used interchangeably, but they are slightly different. Digital wallet is an umbrella term that includes mobile wallets. In other words, mobile wallets are a type of digital wallet, but not all digital wallets are mobile wallets. \nA digital wallet can store your payment information and be accessed on your desktop computer, laptop or mobile device. A mobile wallet is a type of digital wallet on a mobile device, like your smartphone or smartwatch. And you can use mobile wallets to make contactless in-store purchases at a store’s physical checkout.\nTypes of digital wallets \nThere are many different digital wallets available, with varying features and transaction capabilities. A few examples of digital wallets include:\nApple Pay®\nGoogle Pay™ \nPayPal\nVenmo\nSamsung Pay®\nBe sure to check compatibility with your devices when figuring out which wallet makes the most sense for your digital money management journey. \nHow do digital wallets work? \nMost digital wallets come with an app you can add to your computer, phone, watch or other smart device. When you’re out shopping, you can pay with most mobile wallets by holding your device near a terminal that has the contactless transaction symbol. The symbol looks like a sideways Wi-Fi symbol.\nTo complete the transaction, you might be required to provide a passcode or authenticate the transaction through fingerprint or facial recognition. From there, you can use the app to make purchases, pay someone directly or even access tickets for things like concerts or travel. For nonmobile digital wallets (shopping from a laptop), you might be prompted to sign in or provide a password.\nWhen it comes to the tech itself, digital wallets might use QR codes, near-field communication or magnetic secure transmission. This technology stores your information and allows you to complete transactions more securely. \nHow to use a digital wallet \nOne of the benefits of a digital wallet is access to quicker transactions. And that can come in handy—especially if you’re out and about and realize you left your physical wallet at home. Many retailers now have updated payment terminals that support contactless payments like mobile wallets and contactless cards.\nHere are just a few ways you can use your digital wallet: \nOnline: Digital wallets can make online shopping easier by automatically filling in your information for you. This way, you don’t have to enter your info each time, and you can check out in just a few clicks.\nOn the go: Simply tap and pay with your mobile wallet on your smartphone, smartwatch or other mobile device when you’re checking out in a store. \nIn apps: Use your digital wallet for easier and more secure in-app purchases. \nAt ATMs: You might also be able to use your mobile wallet instead of a physical card at some ATMs.\nDigital wallet advantages and disadvantages \nThere are several potential pros and cons of using a digital wallet. Some potential advantages to consider include: \nVirtual versions of credit cards, gift cards and more: Once they’re added to your digital wallet, you can access credit cards, gift cards, tickets and more from the app, even when you don’t have your physical wallet. \nContactless payment options: With a mobile wallet, you can use your smartphone, smartwatch or tablet to make payments without a physical card. Keep in mind that you’ll only be able to do so if the store supports contactless payments. \nQuicker transactions: Making purchases with your digital wallet can save you time since you won’t have to dig through your wallet for a physical card.\nAdditional security features: Digital wallets let you add extra layers of security like two-factor authentication, facial recognition and fingerprint scanning to access your wallet and authorize transactions.\nSome potential disadvantages to consider include: \nNot always compatible or accepted: Mobile wallet payments may not be an accepted form of payment at every vendor or store you visit.\nMust know how to set up and use: If you’re not comfortable setting up your digital wallet and adding cards to the app, it can be difficult to get your digital wallet up and running. But Capital One cardholders can easily add their eligible cards to certain digital wallets through the Capital One Mobile app.\nIncreased security risk if you lose your phone: If your phone gets stolen or you lose it, your digital wallet may not be as secure if your phone isn’t password protected and you don’t have two-factor authentication enabled for your digital and mobile wallet apps.\nKeep in mind that there are other contactless and digital payment methods to consider alongside digital wallets, such as virtual cards and contactless credit and debit cards. And many of Capital One’s U.S.-issued credit cards and debit cards feature contactless technology. These include popular credit cards like SavorOne, Quicksilver, QuicksilverOne and Platinum, as well as 360 Checking debit cards.\nAre digital wallets and mobile wallet apps safe? \nDigital wallets use some of the latest security features to help keep your information safe and prevent both identity theft and credit card fraud. These features include the following:\nTokenization can help protect your card information by creating unique “tokens” associated with your credit card number. Because you’re only sharing tokenized card details, retailers don’t have access to your actual card number, making it more difficult for fraudsters to view or use your financial information. \nYou can combine the safety features of the wallet with those of your phone or other devices. This includes two-factor authentication, Face ID, fingerprint ID, PINs and screen locks. \nBut what if your device is lost or stolen? Setting up additional security, like fingerprint ID and password protection, can help make your device more secure.\nAs with other forms of payment, digital wallets could be susceptible to hackers and scams. It’s important to use strong passwords and change them regularly, monitor your accounts, avoid making transactions on unsecured Wi-Fi networks and enable all the safety options mentioned previously.\nDigital wallets in a nutshell \nDigital wallets are exactly what they sound like, and they can be quicker and more secure than using physical cards or cash at checkout. Plus, you can set up your digital wallet and link your Capital One debit or credit cards in a few easy steps—making payments safer, faster and more convenient.\nReady to take advantage of the convenience that digital wallets provide?

  "text": "As financial technology evolves, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions have found ways to make online banking and digital money management more convenient for users. Mobile banking apps—including the Capital One Mobile app—let you check account balances and transfer money from your mobile device. And you can even deposit paper checks from virtually anywhere using your smartphone or tablet.\nBut what exactly is mobile check deposit, and how does it work? Also, is it a safe way to deposit money into your Capital One account? Read on for a step-by-step guide to the Capital One mobile check deposit process.\nMobile check deposit is a way to deposit a paper check through your banking app using a smartphone or tablet.\nYou can usually deposit U.S. personal, business or government checks, but there may be exclusions.\nCapital One customers can download the Capital One Mobile app to start making mobile deposits today.\nWhat is mobile check deposit? \nMobile check deposit is exactly that: a way to deposit a paper check using a mobile device. Traditionally, you’d need to track down an ATM or visit your bank or credit union to deposit a check. But mobile deposit allows you to snap a picture of the check using your smartphone or tablet camera and upload it through your mobile banking app.\nWhat types of checks can I deposit using mobile check deposit? \nThe types of checks you can deposit can vary depending on which financial institution you use. For instance, Capital One customers can generally deposit U.S. personal, business or government checks with their mobile banking app—but there may be exclusions. These could include: \nChecks that are undated, more than six months old or postdated\nChecks payable to anyone other than you or a joint account holder\nChecks payable to cash\nTraveler’s checks\nMoney orders\nForeign checks\nFor more information on the types of checks you can deposit through your Capital One Mobile app, check out these mobile deposit terms and conditions.\nHow does mobile check deposit work? \nMobile check deposit works by using a service called remote deposit capture. Think of it like scanning a document onto your computer. Essentially, remote deposit capture lets you take a digital image of your check. Your financial institution will then collect the images and process your deposit.\nDo mobile checks deposit instantly? \nIn most cases, mobile check deposits aren’t instantaneous. You may have to wait at least one business day for the mobile deposit to process, and some banks may also have a cutoff time for deposits. If you deposit a check after that time, you may have to wait another business day for it to process. \nTip: Capital One customers can typically access their funds the next business day. But if you deposit a check using your mobile app after 9 p.m. ET, your check may take additional time to process.\nIs mobile check deposit safe? \nMost banks and financial institutions—including Capital One—use advanced security features to keep your account safe. For example, Capital One protects your mobile deposits with encryption and device recognition technology. \nAlso, your check deposit information and photos won’t be stored on your smartphone. And using mobile check deposit can even make some types of check fraud more difficult. For instance, a thief may not be able to steal a check if you use your mobile device to deposit it quickly and then properly void or destroy it after the deposit is confirmed.\nThat said, there are some steps you can take to help protect your financial information when making a mobile check deposit: \nUse a strong password. Using a complex password—a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters or symbols—is one of the most effective ways to help keep your account safe.\nSet up two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure used to help verify your identity when you log in to your account. For instance, you may use Face ID initially, then have to input a PIN sent to your cellphone via text message. Enabling 2FA can help reduce the risk of someone else gaining access to your account.\nAvoid unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks when banking. Generally speaking, it’s a good idea to avoid using public Wi-Fi when performing any tasks that involve transferring sensitive information, like making a mobile deposit. Make sure you’ve got a secure connection before logging in to your account, or use your smartphone’s data connection instead.\nEnable mobile security alerts. Many mobile banking apps offer mobile security notifications or SMS text alerts, which can help you stay on top of potentially fraudulent activity. For example, Capital One Mobile app users can set up SMS fraud alerts from Eno, the Capital One virtual assistant. If Eno notices any unusual activity, it can reach out with a text message.\nStay on top of phishing scams. Phishing is a type of scam that occurs when fraudsters pretend to be legitimate sources, like your bank or credit card company, to access personal information. Phishing scams can take the form of text messages, emails or phone calls. And, in many cases, they look or sound deceptively similar to an official bank communication. To help protect your digital identity, avoid clicking links in emails or text messages. Instead, navigate directly to your banking app or its website.\nHow to make a mobile check deposit in 6 easy steps \nReady to make a mobile deposit using your Capital One Mobile app? Here’s how to deposit a check on the go using your smartphone or tablet.\n1. Understand deposit limits \nIn some cases, you may be limited on how much you can deposit per transaction, or on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Luckily, you can find that information in the Capital One Mobile app. Before you upload a photo of your check, the app will alert you to any applicable limits. If your check exceeds that amount, you can use the app’s branch locator to find an ATM or branch near you.\n2. Endorse the check \nNext, endorse the check you wish to deposit—just like you would if you were depositing it at your local branch. Capital One customers should write For Capital One mobile deposit below their signature on the back of the check before taking photos and uploading them through the mobile app.\n3. Open the mobile deposit feature in your banking app \nLog in to your Capital One Mobile banking app and select the account you want to deposit the check into, then click the Deposit option next to the camera icon. Then, input the deposit amount and any other requested information.\n4. Take photos of the check \nOnce you’ve added the deposit amount, it’s time to take a picture of your check. For best results, place your check on a flat, dark-background surface to improve clarity. Make sure all four corners of the check fit within the on-screen frame to avoid any processing holdups. Then, hit the camera icon in your mobile app to open the camera.\nOnce you’ve taken a clear photo of the front of the check, repeat the process on the back of the check.\n5. Confirm the details and submit your deposit \nReview the details of your check after uploading the images and ensure that the information is correct. Swipe the Slide to Deposit button to submit the deposit. \n6. Hold on to the check until the deposit is confirmed \nYour deposit request may have gone through, but it’s still a good idea to hold on to your check for a few days. Capital One recommends keeping the check in a safe, secure place until you see the full amount deposited in your account. After the deposit is confirmed, you can safely destroy the check.\nWhat if a mobile check deposit fails? \nMobile check deposit could fail for a number of reasons, including: \nWeak internet connection\nImages that are too dark, are too light or cut off parts of the check\nUnclear or missing information on the check\nGlitches within the mobile banking app\nIf you receive an error message, take some time to ensure you’ve endorsed the check, signed your full name, and verified the deposit amount and account details. Then, try taking new pictures. If your deposit request still doesn’t go through, you may consider reaching out to your financial institution for assistance.\nMobile check deposit FAQs \nStill curious about mobile check deposit?

  "text": "Cash advances are convenient, but it's important to understand how they work before requesting one.\nWhat is a cash advance? \nA cash advance is when you use your credit card to obtain cash, such as from an ATM or bank branch. But there are others types of transactions that are also considered cash advances, such as using your credit card to: transfer money to friends using apps like PayPal, Venmo or Moneygram, pay a debt (such as a car loan) using a third-party bill pay service, buy casino chips or lottery tickets, or exchange dollars for foreign currency.\nKnow the cost: \nCash advances usually include transaction fees and a higher APR than credit card purchases. With each cash advance, we charge a front-end fee, or service charge, that posts to your account the day of the transaction. Be sure to review your account terms for details.\nThings work a little differently when it comes to how payments are applied to cash advances. Check out your account terms so you'll know what to expect.\nKnow your cash advance limit and available credit for cash advances: \nLook at your most recent credit card statement and find your Cash Advance Limit. Keep in mind, sometimes ATMs have additional limits. You also must have sufficient total credit line available to take a cash advance. For example, if you have used all of your available credit for purchases, you cannot take a cash advance, even if you have not used all of your cash advance line.\nTo get a cash advance at an ATM with your Personal Identification Number (PIN): \nFollow the cash advance instructions displayed on the ATM\nMake sure you understand any fees that the ATM might charge in addition to those outlined in your account terms before completing the transaction\nHow to get a cash advance if you don’t have your PIN \nYou can take a cash advance inside a bank lobby that displays the Visa or MasterCard credit card logo. You’ll just need to provide a government issued photo ID like a driver's license along with your Capital One card.\nForgot your PIN? You can request a new one. It usually takes several days for your PIN to arrive in the mail, but you might be eligible to get one instantly by requesting it online.",

Here’s what you can expect throughout the process.\nBefore you file a dispute \nBefore you report a problem to Capital One, complete these steps and speed up the process of filing your claim.\nConfirm the charge is posted\nA pending transaction can’t be disputed because the amount may change or drop off of your account entirely. You can report a problem with a transaction once the transaction has been posted, which is generally within about 5 days. \nContact the merchant\nTry reaching out to the merchant to solve the problem first. Working with them directly is often the fastest way to settle issues. It can take up to 90 days for Capital One to resolve a dispute on your behalf. \nHave your paperwork on hand\nIf the issue hasn't been resolved after contacting the merchant, you’ll want to get your documents organized before filing your dispute with Capital One. Make sure to hang on to your documentation until your dispute is closed.\nExamples of things to gather:\nReceipts and invoices\nPictures of the product or service\nCommunications with the merchant to try to fix the issue\nWhen you file a dispute \nTo file a dispute digitally, you need to file the dispute within 90 days of the transaction date. If 90 days have passed, you can still file a dispute by calling the number on the back of your card.\nOne of the most convenient ways to report a problem with a charge is in the Capital One app or on the website. To start your dispute, select the transaction from your recent transaction list. Then select Report a problem and answer questions about the charge.\nHere’s how to sign up for an online account or download our mobile app.\nAfter you file a dispute \nOnce you submit your claim, here’s what to expect:\nCapital One will act as the \"go-between\" for you and the merchant, working on your behalf.\nWe may provide a temporary credit on your credit card account for the disputed amount and related fees and interest.\nWe might also place a hold on your available credit for the same amount. \nWithin 90 days, the process will be concluded and you’ll receive a message either online or in the mail that provides more details about the claim decision.\nThere are three possible outcomes:\nThe merchant is found responsible\nIf this happens, we’ll make the temporary credit permanent.\nThe merchant is not found responsible\nIn this case, we’ll remove the temporary credit and the original charge will be reapplied to your account.\nThe merchant is found partially responsible\nIn this case, we’ll remove the temporary credit and a portion of the original charge will be reapplied to your account.\nIf you’re not satisfied with the outcome, the message you get from Capital One will explain how to appeal the decision. \nWhat’s considered a dispute?\nYou can file a dispute claim when you’ve authorized a transaction, meaning you gave the merchant permission to charge you, but there's an issue with the product, service or transaction details. \nSome examples include:\nYou're still being charged for something you canceled\nYou didn't receive what you paid for\nWhat you received was not what was described\nYou've been charged twice for the same purchase\nHow long do I have to file a dispute?\nIf you want to file a dispute on our website or through the Capital One Mobile app you'll need to do so within 90 days of the transaction date. Otherwise, you can file a dispute at any time by calling the number on the back of your card. \nHow long does the dispute resolution process take?\nDisputes filed with Capital One will be resolved within 90 days.\nIf you're unable to reach the merchant about a charge, you can still file a dispute claim with Capital One. Documentation demonstrating your attempt to contact the merchant to resolve the issue could help strengthen your case, even if the merchant didn't respond.",

We apply any portion of your payment in excess of your minimum payment to higher rate balances before lower rate ones. If your payment exceeds the minimum payment by an amount sufficient to pay a higher rate balance shown on your statement, you still may have a balance at that higher rate on your next statement as a result of transactions, interest, or fees charged to your account before your payment was credited. For example, if your monthly statement shows a $1,000 balance for cash advances, sending in a check for $1,000 plus your minimum payment amount may not bring your cash advance balance to $0. This is because interest continues to accrue on the $1,000 balance between the last day of the statement and the date we receive your payment, but the interest does not post to your account until the next statement.",

  "text": "June 17, 2021 |5 min read\nMinority communities tend to be underrepresented, but the main barrier is being underestimated, especially in the financial services industry. These underserved communities face unique systemic barriers and challenges to owning and scaling a business.\nArlan Hamilton, the founder of Backstage Capital, talks through her book It’s About Damn Time: How to Turn Being Underestimated into Your Greatest Advantage in the Your Next Move live-event series by Inc. in partnership with Capital One Business. \nIn Hamilton’s experience, she had difficulty breaking into an industry dominated by white men, but she was able to take on these roadblocks and use them to create an advantage. \"I saw a world that felt like I did on the inside,” said Hamilton, whose firm invests in women, LGBTQ+ founders and people of color — and who identifies as all three. “I saw that passion and that moonshot thinking, and the optimism that was unbridled, and creativity that couldn't be measured.”\nHow underrepresentation affects minority communities in business \nTo identify underrepresentation and underestimation, let’s define what it is and how it affects minority entrepreneurs and the LGBTQ+ community.\nUnderrepresentation is defined as a statistical difference in the demographics of a given population. In business, this may present itself as not having enough diverse voices and employees in a company meeting room, or even not having enough funding to be a viable competitor within their industry. \nUnderestimation is defined as the belief that minority individuals have to work to overcome and correct initial impressions of those who have already made assumptions.\nHamilton noted the difference between underestimated and underrepresented like this: “The word underrepresented has this instant connotation of being the other, the less-than, the not-to-be-taken-as-seriously. As if they’re the ones who need more help.” \n“And the word help is used more than backing or funding,” she said. “But the word underestimated just reinforces what we already believe about ourselves, which is that you just haven't caught up yet. You just don't understand yet.” \nMinority communities work to overcome the challenges of both underrepresentation and underestimation at the same time. These challenges have a greater impact on minority communities because they have to divide their focus between these barriers and every other task on hand.\nChallenging the status quo as an underrepresented founder \nAt Backstage Capital, Hamilton works to break down barriers to the status quo. There’s space for everyone and anyone who wants to be in this industry, but it won’t come without its challenges. \nHamilton found that underrepresented and underestimated founders need different types of support.\nIn her experience, “We find that underrepresented, underestimated founders tend to be over-mentored and underfunded. So, we do have a mentorship program, but it’s about access more than anything.” \nHamilton also shared her views on what's to come as more companies and individuals become aware of the inherent disadvantages. “My thinking was, if someone were to figure out how to challenge this status quo, the opportunities that lie ahead would be immeasurable. And not just for underestimated, underrepresented founders—but everyone.” \nConfidence within new investors \nThere’s hope for new investors and founders coming into the space. \"You see this wonderful new generation of angel investors and of syndicate investors and small fund investors who are coming into their own and really bringing a fresh perspective to things, “ Hamilton emphasized. \nFrom an investor’s point of view, the new generation is looking past underestimation and using it to their advantage instead of being stuck in the belief they couldn't achieve their aspirations. “Thank goodness that the majority of them didn't get stuck in this belief that they couldn't, that they felt that they were underestimated rather than stopped at the door.\"\nHamilton noted that when the savvy investors she knows hear underrepresented, they’re often hearing homework. “But if you say underestimated they hear the word challenge — something untapped, something interesting and intriguing that I haven’t learned enough about. You immediately tap into something on both sides that makes everybody rise to the occasion,” she said. \nHow to overcome underestimation as a minority entrepreneur \nHere are some ways you can use underestimation to your advantage. \nProve people’s assumptions wrong. Before walking into rooms — literally and figuratively — remind yourself of who you are, where you come from, what strength lies within. It’s not about proving the person wrong, but their assumptions. What do you imagine they’re assuming about you? \nLeverage your value. Be confident in the qualities you bring to the table. Find the things that make you unique and stand out from the rest. If you’re unsure on how to find that leverage, start to reverse engineer your dreams. Ask yourself what type of company you’d like to work for and the type of boss you’d like to be. And if those don’t exist, build your own. \nEvaluate each challenge differently. Understand that each situation will be different from the rest. Recognize that change and adversity is inevitable, but within each are valuable lessons, memories and opportunities that add to your experience. \n\"I'm realistic: There's active racism in this world of startup investing and startup creation,” said Hamilton. “There's active misogyny; there's active homophobia. But by and large, what I notice over and over again is that it’s just a really incredible world that was meant for us all.” \nCommitting to change \nBoth inside and outside of Capital One, we’re committed to celebrating and supporting diverse business owners and the LGBTQ+ community. No matter your pronouns or how you identify, we’re an ally, and we welcome you for who you are and the perspective you bring. \nTo learn more about using underrepresentation as an advantage, as well as other insights and resources to help move your business forward, check out the Capital One Business Hub.\nCapital One Business\nResources and tools to help move your business forward from the experts at Capital One.",

  "text": "July 22, 2021 |5 min read\nAmid the uncertainty and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses are taking this time to reassess their capital growth strategies. \nMore traditional businesses are focusing on paying down their debts and are actively growing their savings by holding on to cash. More risk-tolerant companies are using the disruption as a chance to grow and invest in new technologies and opportunities. \nDeciding which capital model or cash strategy is right for your business requires the managerial team and owners to consider the unique circumstances the company is facing. So how can you ensure you’re making the right choices for your company’s financial position? Here are a few things to keep in mind that can help you balance your capital expenditures and savings strategy to keep your business growing and stable.\nMaintain a healthy source of emergency cash \nEmergencies happen all the time. Make sure your company is ready for them by having a strong supply of emergency cash on hand. Opening a business bank account can help you manage and monitor your cash flow more effectively. If you don’t have the capital on hand, consider opening a line of credit that will help you cover emergency expenses when they come up. \nIn addition, keep an eye on your company’s cash flow rather than focusing on revenue alone. Ultimately, a company with $1 million in revenue that maintains enough cash to cover expenses for two months is more viable than a company making $10 million that can’t cover its expenses for a couple of weeks.\nYou can work with your banker to find ways to leverage your current cash supply. Consider additional ways to boost cash flow, like digital payment programs. These programs may help make it easier for your customers to pay you, which then makes it faster for you to receive funds and easier for you to generate savings by reducing the cost of payment processing.\nPrioritize capital expenditure needs \nCapital expenditure is part of business. But during times of economic recovery, it’s important to carefully assess capital expenditure needs. While capital expenditures like purchasing new equipment or technology or investing in building improvements can help you take advantage of growth opportunities, they can also impact your balance sheet. Look at the long-term costs associated with the investment. This means doing a deep dive into your company’s operations and considering these key factors:\nLabor - Before investing in new equipment or products, consider the impact of those investments on your labor costs. For example, a $1 million system won’t benefit your company if you can’t find the right person to run the system. Make sure the investment will work for you rather than create a burden on your balance sheet.\nSupply - Consider the macro environment of your industry and any shortages that could drive up costs in the short term. These could include materials like microchips, paper products, lumber or other raw materials needed for your product. Shortages can increase the prices you’ll pay for your regular expenses. Make sure you’re able to justify the added cost and that the cost won’t negatively impact profitability and sustainability.\nRethinking the business strategy \nIf you’re weighing the benefits of holding cash versus investing, it’s a good idea to rethink your business’s strategy. For example, if your revenue remained constant throughout the pandemic, but your margins shrank, you’ll need to assess whether your sources of revenue are truly working for you. You might need to rebalance your clients or book of business to free up cash flow.\nIf shutdowns impacted your business, you’ll need to do things differently to remain competitive. Tightening your belt and ignoring the potential benefits of investing idle cash may not benefit your business enough. You may need to consider using a different operating model to restore your company to its normal level of profitability.\nMaking smart changes to remain competitive \nIt’s natural for businesses to make some changes based on supply and demand trends and business priorities. Be willing to look at your company’s operations and weigh the costs and benefits of holding cash versus investing it. If you understand your company’s position, you’ll be able to make adjustments quickly. This can help you create a resilient and sustainable plan for the future.",

  "text": "BEC is a sophisticated scam in which fraudsters disguise themselves as a trusted entity and trick either an individual or a business into performing a transfer of funds through wire transfer, ACH or checks. The victim believes they’re conducting a legitimate transaction, only to find out later it was fraudulent, potentially resulting in significant losses.\nWhen BEC scams first surfaced, fraudsters typically spoofed email addresses of C-level executives to request wire payments be sent to accounts owned by the fraudster. A spoofed email is when someone manipulates an email address to resemble a trusted one:\nValid email address: janedoe@capitalone.com\nSpoofed email address: janedoe@capitalon3.com\nThese instances still happen frequently and can be identified by taking a closer look at the email address information.\nFraudsters have evolved their schemes dramatically over the years and will sometimes compromise an email address or an entire email chain. This can be done by getting a victim to click on a phishing email or download a malicious attachment, which allows the fraudsters to compromise the targeted email address. They can then send and receive emails from what others may believe is a trusted source. In other instances, an entire email chain may be intercepted and manipulated by a fraudster or a team of fraudsters. In this example, fraudsters will insert themselves—using spoofed email addresses—into an existing email chain and begin to control the conversation. Being cognizant of this possibility can help mitigate the risk of falling victim to a request in an intercepted email chain.\nYou should also be mindful of other BEC schemes like spoofed emails from legal entities, requests for W-2 information or requests for gift card codes instead of cash.\nAs BEC has become an increasingly popular cybercrime, the number of reports and associated losses have also increased. The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), releases its annual Internet Crime Report to cover statistics and topics from the past year.\nIn its 2020 annual report, IC3 noted the following statistics and findings about BEC:\n19,360 BEC complaints were received in 2020 \n63,517 BEC complaints were received between 2018 and 2020\n$1.8 billion was lost as a result of BEC in 2020, up from $263 million in 2015, which is an increase of 584% over that period\n$4.9 billion+ was lost as a result of BEC between 2018 and 2020, with increases year over year",

  "text": "If you’ve ever felt stressed about money, you’re not alone. According to a recent CreditWise survey, 73% of people consider their finances to be a major source of stress in their lives, causing more angst than politics (59%), work (49%), or family (46%). That was particularly true for Millennials and Generation Z, eight out of 10 of whom reported being stressed by their money situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified those concerns, and is inspiring many people to re-analyze what financial well-being means to them.\nAt Capital One, we believe that you should have a healthy relationship with your money. After all, money affects every single area of life, from education to marriage and having children, to how well you enjoy your golden years. That’s why we’re proud to be launching our new Money & Life Program, which builds upon our former Money Coaching program.\nThis free program is available to anyone, regardless of your financial journey or whether they are a Capital One customer. Instead of traditional coaching and financial advising programs which can bring up difficult emotions, the Money & Life Program aims to help you reflect on your relationship with money and adopt new habits, perspectives, and behaviors that will help you reach your goals. The Money & Life Program currently offers three experiences: 1:1 mentoring, workshops, and self-guided digital exercises. \nMoney & Life Mentoring\nPreviously, participants could book appointments to work 1:1 with a Money Coach at most Capital One Cafés. Folks saw tremendous value in Money Coaching, so we decided to expand the program with more offerings, in more locations—including your own home. \nThus, the program has evolved into a mentorship model, in which mentors will work individually with participants, helping you reflect on how money fits into your life in a judgement-free zone. Professional mentors will help you identify your financial goals, and determine new habits and behaviors that can help you get closer to and better align with your unique goals.\nEveryone is eligible for up to three 1:1 mentoring sessions. These can be a virtual 1:1 mentoring session from wherever you live.\nMoney & Life Workshops\nCapital One is also excited to announce that money workshops will be part of the Money & Life Program, currently available on-demand and eventually available in person, covering real-life financial topics.\nTalk Money with Your Honey is designed to help you and your partner explore your respective pasts and how they have influenced your feelings about money, providing guidance on establishing healthy communication skills about your financial goals and how to achieve them. Your Money, Your Values examines the relationship between—you guessed it—your money and values, and how your financial habits can influence (or impede) your goals. It ultimately helps you understand how you can spend and save your money in ways that feel most purposeful and in line with what you care about the most.\nMoney & Life Workshops are meant to be a catalyst for sparking inspiration within your social group. You can attend a solo, or take the class with friends and family. Why take a workshop together? Research shows that adopting a new wellness habit – whether that’s exercising consistently, eating healthier, or improving your finances – is easier to do when you’re surrounded by like-minded people. You gain the benefit of sharing your struggles and successes, and that can ultimately push you to be more successful in your journey towards financial wellness than if you were trying to go it alone. \nMoney & Life Exercises\nThe topic of money takes time and reflection, and that’s exactly what our new self-guided exercises are designed to help with. \nAs a part of this new Money & Life Program, we offer self-guided digital exercises, such as Map Your Spend, Goals Planner (coming later this year) and more. You can complete these exercises at your own pace, either alone or in tandem with the mentoring and workshop aspects of the Money & Life Program. These exercises can help you reflect individually on your current relationship with money, and whether or not that’s ultimately in line with the life you want to live. \nThese self-guided exercises, along with mentoring and workshops, can help you gain clarity about your finances so that you can take positive action. At Capital One, we believe in being intentional with money so that you can live life on your terms, and that’s why we’re so excited to share our new Money & Life Program with you and your family. \nWe hope you found this helpful.

  "text": "September 30, 2021 |7 min read\nIf you’re like most people, you’ve got money on your mind. You may ask yourself: Do I have enough saved? Could I make better choices? Will I ever reach my goals? \nThat’s where Money & Life Mentoring, part of the Money & Life Program at Capital One, comes in. It can help you see how money fits into your life so you can make healthier decisions. Here’s how three people used mentoring to define their goals and create a plan for going after them.\nHelping people examine their beliefs and behaviors \nTammi Scott is a Money & Life Mentor at Capital One. Clients come to her with a variety of needs around finances and life—for example, looking for ways to pay off debt or finding time for the things that matter most to them. \nIt’s Tammi’s job to help them examine their values and beliefs, make positive adjustments to their behaviors, and work toward their goals.\n“I start by asking one question,” she says. “What do you really want for your life?”\nHere’s how three clients worked with Tammi to answer that question—and the “aha” moments that resulted.\n“Aha” moment 1: Realizing theres no \"right\" way to manage money \nTammi once had a client in her early 30s who came to mentoring for clarity around her money choices. \nThe client was taking a practical approach to her money, living within her means and saving for unexpected expenses. But she worried that she wasn’t managing her money in the “right” way. \nTammi helped her client realize there wasn’t an ideal way to use her money—just the way that worked for her. \nThen she helped her identify what was important in her life—security, fun and community. And they talked about how money could support the client in a life that aligned with her values.\nAction plan: Through mentoring, the client adjusted her life and budget based on the values she identified. \nThe Money & Life Program helps clients consider how to use both money and time, which ideally work together. With that in mind, here’s how the client did it:\nSecurity: She opened a savings account that she used as an “emergency fund” and continued to save toward retirement through her company-sponsored plan.\nFun: She added an “entertainment” category to her budget and found low-cost ways to enjoy herself like getting out in nature.\nCommunity: She “gave back” by doing volunteer work with a local organization that had meaning for her.\n“Aha” moment 2: Changing self-defeating money behaviors \nAnother of Tammi’s clients—this one was also in his early 30s—needed help with choices around money. He was discouraged by his debt and particularly concerned about paying off student loans. \nThe client had a habit of making online purchases, believing they weren’t really adding up. He also spent money when he felt down in order to experience a temporary lift in his mood, which often led to exceeding his means.\nDuring mentoring sessions, the client identified short-, medium- and long-term goals. He made it his priority to focus on those in the short term (ideally accomplished in six months) and the medium term (ideally accomplished in one to two years). To stay on course meant asking himself questions like, “If I make this small purchase now, will it move me closer to my goals or further from them?”\nAction plan: The client took what he learned from mentoring and started working toward his short- and medium-term goals. \nThese were his major action items: \nTrack small purchases, since they can add up and make it harder to save while paying off debt.\nUse practical money-management tips like setting up a budget to help reach his goals. \nManage low moods by finding other ways to deal with uncomfortable feelings—for example, going for a walk or calling a friend.\n“Aha” moment 3: Balancing living for today with planning for tomorrow \nAnother client of Tammi’s signed up for mentoring to get some perspective on planning for the future. Specifically, she worried that she wasn’t saving enough for retirement.\nBut she also wanted balance. Since she was only in her 40s and more than 20 years from retirement, she wanted to enjoy life now while also planning for tomorrow.\nThrough mentoring, the client defined what it would look like to enjoy retirement based on her priorities. In her case, it meant having financial security that allowed her to live a full life.\nThe client also realized that she should combine what she learned in mentoring with advice from a certified financial planner. She needed the extra guidance to keep from wondering whether she was doing “enough”—which often led to a cycle of inaction and worry.\nAction plan: Through mentoring, the client found ways to live in the “now” while making retirement planning more tangible. \nHere are the action items that topped her list: \nMake more time for things that brought her joy—family, friends and travel.\nContinue saving for retirement.\nMeet with a certified financial planner to see the math and create a plan for reaching her retirement goals.\nThe Money & Life Program offers mentoring and more \nA healthy relationship with money is important to everyone. That’s why the Money & Life Program is free for anyone, even if you’re not a Capital One customer.\nAnd since people enjoy learning in different ways, the program gives you options—all virtual for now. You can choose the one that works best for you or try all three:\nMoney & Life Mentoring: Meet virtually one-on-one with a professional Money & Life Mentor, who’ll help you reflect on how money fits into your life. You’ll also examine how you can adapt your financial behaviors to better achieve your goals.\nMoney & Life Workshops: See how powerful things happen in group settings in a workshop run by a professional mentor. You’ll learn along with others, have new realizations about your own life and start creating a plan for financial well-being.\nMoney & Life Exercises: Take self-guided exercises that help you become more aware of the ways financial stress is showing up in your life. Once you understand the stress, you can start to manage it—instead of the other way around.\nNo matter which option you choose, the Money & Life Program helps you plan out your goals in life—and connect them with your financial behaviors. So you can reach for your dreams more comfortably and confidently.\nAfter all, it’s your money, your life and your goals. And the power to reach them is within you.",
