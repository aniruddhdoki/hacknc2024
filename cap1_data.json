You can open a bank account online with Capital One. Just grab two forms of ID (such as a driver's license, Social Security card, passport or birth certificate) and proof of address, then apply online right from your phone, tablet or computer.\nWhich Capital One bank account is right for me?\nIt depends. Most people choose a Capital One bank account based on their lifestyle and goals. A checking account works well for day-to-day spending and monthly budgets, a savings account can help you put away money for future needs, while certificates of deposit (CDs) can help you save money with a fixed interest rate for a fixed amount of time. We also offer a teen checking account featuring a fee-free debit card and easy-to-use mobile app, as well as a kids-friendly savings account that helps earn interest while growing their money.\nWhat type of account should I get if I'm looking for interest?\nTypically, certificates of deposit (CDs) and savings accounts are where you earn interest on your money. Some banks have checking accounts that earn interest—most don't. However, you can earn interest with every online Capital One bank account—checking, savings and CDs.\nHow much of my money is safe in a bank?\nNearly all banks carry FDIC insurance to protect the bank accounts of their customers. In the event of bank failure, this insurance covers what are known as depository accounts—such as checking, savings and certificates of deposits (CDs)—up to the allowable limits.

For more info, check out the FAQs on Kids Savings or MONEY Teen Checking.\nWhat are the age requirements for a kids savings account?\nDifferent banks may have different requirements. At Capital One, it’s never too early to open a Kids Savings Account for your child. Start saving when they’re a baby and watch their money grow as they do. A Kids Savings Account is owned by one child under 18 years old and one adult. If the child is under the age of 12, the adult must be the child’s parent or legal guardian.\nWhen should I open a savings account for my kid?\nThere’s no right or wrong time to start.

If your Account charges off, the entire balance is due immediately.\nMastercard is a registered trademark, and the circles design is a trademark of Mastercard International Incorporated.\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS REWARDS PROGRAM\nHow do I earn rewards?\nYou will earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel using this Rewards card account, and 1.5% cash back on all other purchases. Earnings will apply to net purchases (purchases minus any credits or returns) only. Cash advances, balance transfers, and checks used to access your account are not considered purchases and will not earn rewards. All purchases made outside of Capital One Travel such as hotel incidentals, upgrades or other expenses, will not earn the enhanced earn rate, but will receive the standard 1.5% cash back earn rate.\nHow does my spend bonus work?\nYou will earn a $200 bonus if you spend at least $500 within 3 months of your rewards membership enrollment date. Once you qualify for this bonus, we will apply it to your rewards balance within two billing cycles. Existing or previous cardmembers are not eligible for this product if they have received a new cardmember bonus for this product in the past 48 months.\nHow do I earn my rewards on purchases made on Capital One Entertainment?\nThrough 12/31/25, you will earn 5% cash back on Capital One Entertainment purchases. Rewards earned will post to your account within 1-2 billing cycles. Qualifying purchases include tickets purchased on the Capital One Entertainment ticketing platform only, paid for with an eligible Capital One rewards card. Tickets purchased through the Capital One cardholder exclusive pre-sales page (www.capitalone.com/pre-sales); tickets purchased directly through the Capital One Hall or Capital One Arena ticketing services; and dining reservations or purchases through Capital One Dining are excluded. Rewards earned will be reclaimed if you cancel or return an eligible purchase.\nWill my rewards ever expire? \nYour rewards are yours for the life of the account—they will not expire. But if your account is closed, you may lose any rewards you have not redeemed.\nIs there a limit to the amount of rewards I can earn? \nThere is no cap to the amount of rewards you can earn on purchases.\nHow do I redeem my rewards?\nYou can get your cash back upon request in the form of a statement credit or a check. You can also set up an automatic redemption preference; options include: (1) at a set time each calendar year or (2) when a specific threshold has been reached. Just go online to capitalone.com. You can also redeem for credits for previous purchases, gift cards, and more. Rates for these redemption options may vary and can change in the sole discretion of Capital One. Accounts that are not in good standing (e.g., suspended, restricted, delinquent, or otherwise in default) or closed may have different redemption options or may lose any unredeemed rewards.\nWhat happens if I do not set up an automatic redemption preference?\nUntil you set up an automatic redemption preference, you will receive your cash back upon your request.\nHow often can I change my automatic redemption preference?\nYou may change your automatic redemption preference at any time, but you cannot request an annual redemption to be fulfilled in the same month you make a change. If you have an automatic redemption preference, you may also make upon-request redemptions without interfering with your pre-established automatic redemption preference.\nHow do I redeem my rewards for new travel reservations?\nGo online to travel.capitalone.com to book your flight, car rental or hotel and use your cash back rewards to pay for your travel.

Please note that Capital One has no control over how merchants itemize and charge related transactions.\nIs my account eligible to transfer rewards?\nYour account may be eligible to transfer rewards.

Or, Capital One otherwise determines that I am unable to make my monthly payments.\nI am under 18 or do not have a valid Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\nI have applied for a Capital One credit card 2 or more times in the last 30 days.\nI have received a new cardmember bonus for this product in the past 48 months.\nI have a past due Capital One credit card account.\nI am over my credit line on a Capital One credit card.\nI have had a Capital One credit card that charged off within the past year.\nI have a non-discharged bankruptcy (one that is still unresolved).\nI have implemented a credit security freeze or credit lock with one or more of the credit bureaus, which prevents Capital One from accessing my credit report.\nWith respect to this account, I understand that:\nI am not obligated to accept the card or pay any fee or charge unless I use this card.\nEven if I am otherwise eligible for this offer, approval is based upon satisfying Capital One's credit standards.\nCapital One may contact me to obtain or confirm application information.\nI am providing my application information to Capital One, N.A. and its affiliates.\nI am authorizing Capital One to check my consumer report information and my Demand Deposit Account data, such as checking account information, and to verify my employment, income, and/or other application information with third parties.\nI am authorizing Capital One to use consumer report information that it collects for analysis and to otherwise improve the products and services it offers.\nI am authorizing Capital One to verify education-related information in my application and am authorizing my school to release enrollment information for that purpose.\nIf I am approved, I am requesting that Capital One send me a physical credit card in the mail and make a virtual card number available to me when I log into the Capital One mobile app or website.\nI may not be eligible to access a virtual card. If I am eligible, I understand I must verify my identity before accessing my virtual card. In some cases, I will not be able to access my virtual card until approximately 30 days after account opening, and I may not have access to my full credit line until my physical card is activated. Web access is needed to manage my virtual card number online or in the Mobile app. Virtual cards may not be accepted by all stores. Virtual cards are not available for debit cards and some credit cards.\nIf I am approved, Capital One may contact me regarding my Card and Account as described in my Capital One Customer Agreement. For example, when I give Capital One my mobile telephone number, I agree to receive messages from Capital One and their authorized agents, including prerecorded and text messages. I also consent to receive calls through an automatic telephone dialer (autodialer).\nI will receive the Capital One Customer Agreement. I am bound by its terms and all future revisions.\nThis offer is nontransferable.\nI understand that, unless the offer discloses a specific credit line, the exact amount of my credit line will be determined by Capital One after review of my application and other information.\nAn applicant, if married, may apply for a separate account.\nEverything I have stated in this application is correct.\nThis card is intended primarily for consumer use.\nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS CARD\nWhen Can I Request A Transfer?\nYou may request a transfer 10 days after your account is opened. Your account may not always be eligible for Transfers. Transfer eligibility is determined by Capital One at our discretion. Transfers between Capital One accounts are not permitted. That means balances cannot be transferred to this account from any other credit card issued by Capital One.\nHow Do You Apply My Payment?\nWe will apply payments up to your minimum payment first to the balance with the lowest APR (including 0% APR), and then to balances with higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment exceeding your minimum payment to the balance with the highest APR, and then to balances with lower APRs.\nHow Can I Avoid Paying Interest Charges?\nIf you pay your statement’s “New Balance” in full by the due date each month, we will not charge interest on any new transactions that post to the purchase balance. If you have been paying your account in full without interest charges, but fail to pay your next “New Balance” in full, we will charge interest on the unpaid balance. For cash advances and transfers, we will start charging interest on the transaction date. From time to time, we may give you offers that allow you to pay less than the total balance and avoid interest charges to new transactions that post to your purchase balance. If we do, we will provide details in the specific offer.\nHow Is The Interest Charge Determined?\nInterest charges accrue from the 1) date of the transaction, 2) date the transaction is processed or 3) first day of the billing period. Interest accrues daily on every unpaid amount until it is paid in full. Any interest that has accrued during a billing period will post to your Account at the end of the billing period and will appear on your next Statement. This means you may owe Interest Charges even if you pay the entire “New Balance” one month, but did not do so the previous month. For example, even if a customer pays their balance in full on a February 26th due date, interest would continue to accrue on the balance from February 2nd (the start of the Billing Cycle) through February 26th, and will appear on their next Statement. Once you start accruing Interest Charges, you generally must pay your New Balance in full for two consecutive Billing Cycles before Interest Charges stop being posted to your Statement. Interest Charges are added to the proper segment of your account. However, we reserve the right to not assess Interest Charges.\nHow Do You Calculate The Interest Charge?\nWe use a method called Average Daily Balance (including new transactions). Under this method, we first calculate your daily balance; for each segment, 1) take the beginning balance and add in new transactions and the periodic interest charge on the previous day’s balance, then 2) subtract any payments and credits for that segment as of that day. The result is the daily balance for each segment. However, if you paid your previous month’s balance in full (or if your balance was zero or a credit amount), new transactions which post to your purchase or special purchase segments are not added to the daily balances. Also, transactions subject to a grace period are not added to the daily balances. \nNext, to find your Average Daily Balance: 1) add the daily balances together for each segment, and 2) divide the sum by the number of days in the billing cycle. \nAt the end of each billing cycle, we determine your Interest Charge as follows: 1) multiply your Average Daily Balance by the daily periodic rate (APR divided by 365) for that segment, and 2) multiply the result by the number of days in the billing period. NOTE: Due to rounding or a minimum interest charge, this calculation may vary from the interest charge actually assessed.\nAre Unauthorized Use Or $0 Fraud Liability Claims Subject To Investigation And Verification?\nYes.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT:\nTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.\nMILITARY LENDING ACT NOTICE\nFederal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: The costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account).\nTo hear this same disclosure and a general description of your payment obligations for this credit card account, please call us toll-free at: 844-788-8999.\nDuring any period in which the Military Lending Act (“the Act”) applies to you, no provision of your Cardholder Agreement that is inconsistent with the Act shall apply and your Cardholder Agreement shall be interpreted to comply with the Act. \nREGIONAL DISCLOSURE INFORMATION\nOhio Residents: Ohio anti-discrimination laws require creditors to make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on individuals upon request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers these laws.\nNew York and Vermont Residents: Capital One may obtain your credit reports, for any legitimate purpose associated with the account or the application or request for an account, including but not limited to reviewing, modifying, renewing and collecting on your account. On your request, you will be informed if such a report was ordered. If so, you will be given the name and address of the consumer reporting agency furnishing the report. New York residents may contact the New York State Department of Financial Services by telephone or visit its website for free information on comparative credit card rates, fees and grace periods. New York State Department of Financial Services: 1-877-226-5697 or http://www.dfs.ny.gov. \nWisconsin Residents: No provision of any marital property agreement, unilateral statement, or court order applying to marital property will adversely affect a creditor’s interests unless, prior to the time credit is granted, the creditor is furnished with a copy of the agreement, statement or court order, or has actual knowledge of the provision. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify the Bank if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.\nPuerto Rico Residents: Puerto Rico Residents may request a copy of these disclosures in Spanish.\nResidentes de Puerto Rico: Pueden solicitar una copia de este documento en Español.\nYOUR BILLING RIGHTS: KEEP THIS DOCUMENT FOR FUTURE USE\nThis notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.\nWhat To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement:\nIf you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:\nCapital One, P. O. Box 30279, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0279\nIn your letter, give us the following information:\nAccount information: Your name and account number.\nDollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.\nDescription of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.\nYou must contact us:\nWithin 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.\nAt least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.\nYou must notify us of any potential errors \nin writing\n. You may call us or notify us electronically, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.\nWhat Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter.\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: \nWithin 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.\nWithin 90 days of our receipt of your letter, we will send you a written notice explaining either that we corrected the error (to appear on your next statement) or the reasons we believe the bill is correct.\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following are true:\nWe cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.\nThe charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.\nWhile you do not have to pay the amount in question until we send you a notice about the outcome of our investigation, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.\nWe can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:\nIf we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.\nIf we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.\nIf you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us at Capital One, P.O. Box 30279, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0279 within \n10 days\ntelling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.\nIf we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.\nYour Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:\nYou must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify; and\nYou must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us \nin writing\nat:\nCapital One, P. O. Box 30279, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0279\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.\n©2024 Capital One. Capital One is a federally registered service mark.

Check out current Capital One 360 CD rates and terms on this page to see how much you can earn. You can enter a deposit amount to instantly see how much you will earn at the end of each term.",

  "text": "How do student credit cards work?\nCapital One student credit cards offer students the chance to build credit by using their card responsibly to make purchases, making timely payments on their balances and maintaining a healthy credit utilization ratio. Capital One student cards also come with student-friendly perks, like cash back.\nWondering what happens to your account after graduation? No need to get a new card—you can still enjoy all the rewards and benefits your Capital One student credit card has to offer.\nBefore applying for a credit card, consider getting pre-approved to see which cards you qualify for. It’s quick, easy, and won’t hurt your credit score. And remember: You don’t need a credit score to apply, though we may use credit scores where available.\nAre student credit cards only for college students?\nYou must be at least 18 years of age and a student to qualify for student credit cards. \nYou may be eligible for a Capital One student card if you’re enrolled—or admitted and planning to enroll in the next three months—at an accredited university, community college or other higher education institution.\nWant to find the best student credit card for you? Getting pre-approved could help you find the right card before you apply.\nWhich student credit card is right for me?\nChoosing the best student credit card for you depends on what you want out of a card. Capital One student credit cards are designed for applicants with little or no credit history—plus they offer no annual fee, hidden fees, or foreign transaction fees. These student credit cards also offer bonuses and let you earn rewards on everyday purchases: \nSavor Rewards for Students features student-friendly perks, like unlimited 3% cash back on dining and at grocery stores—excluding superstores like Walmart® and Target®—and entertainment, including popular streaming services, plus 1% cash back on all other purchases.\nQuicksilver Rewards for Students allows qualifying students to earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases and a one-time $50 cash bonus after spending $100 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening.\nConsider getting pre-approved to see which cards you qualify for.\nHow do I know if I’ll be approved for a student credit card?\nSeveral factors—like an applicant’s credit score, payment history, and income—may influence whether or not someone will be approved for a credit card. \nBut if you’re just starting your financial journey, don’t worry. Capital One student cards are designed for students with little or no credit history.\nGetting pre-approved could help you see which cards you may qualify for before you apply. And if you’re not a student but want to build credit, check out these other alternatives. \nWill getting pre-approved hurt my credit score?\nNo, checking to see if you’re pre-approved for a Capital One credit card won’t cause any damage to your credit score. That’s because our pre-approval tool won’t result in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which can temporarily lower your credit score.\nOur pre-approval tool will show you the student credit cards you’re more likely to qualify for, too. That way, you can apply with more confidence.\nWhat can I do to help improve my credit score?\nThere are a few steps you can take to use your card responsibly and help build a better credit score over time: \n1. Use CreditWise by Capital One to monitor your credit score and TransUnion credit report.\n2. Make timely payments on your bills each month.\n3. Stay below your credit limit—and keep an eye on your credit utilization.\n4. Limit new credit applications to prevent hard inquiries on your credit report.\nAnd after implementing these tactics to raise your score, you may consider getting pre-approved for a Capital One credit card to find one that works best for you and your lifestyle.",

What's most important to you?\nSelect up to two.\nFrequently asked questions\nPre-approval involves a soft inquiry, which doesn't affect your credit score. But if you choose to accept a card offer, the acceptance will trigger a hard inquiry, which may impact your score.\nWe'll check your eligibility for these cards: Quicksilver, Savor, Venture, VentureOne, Quicksilver for Good Credit, Savor for Good Credit, VentureOne for Good Credit, Platinum, QuicksilverOne, Quicksilver Secured, and Platinum Secured.\nAfter you answer some questions about yourself, we'll tell you if you're pre-approved for Capital One card offers.\nYou don't need to apply separately if you're pre-approved—just accept an offer and we'll mail you your card. In some cases, we may need to verify your identity or collect additional information before we're able to finalize our approval.\nWhen you're on our website, any information you give us is immediately encrypted so nobody else can access your data. Everything you tell us during pre-approval is secure and stays between us.\nYou will be ineligible for Capital One consumer credit card products if:\nYou have implemented a credit security freeze or credit lock at any of the credit bureaus, which prevents Capital One from accessing your credit.\nYou may be ineligible for some consumer credit card products if:\nYou were recently approved for a Capital One credit card; or\nYou have applied for a Capital One credit card 2 or more times in the past 30 days.\nIf you've submitted this form within the last 24 hours, we may provide you with your most recent result and not re-process your information.\nIf you've submitted this form in the last 24 hours, we may provide you with your most recent result and not re-process your information.",

  "text": "Accessibility Tips\nHow to zoom in your screen\nSome people like to zoom into the screen or web browser in order to see things better. Here are a few ways of doing it depending on your setup:\nOn Windows, press the Windows key and plus sign (+) at the same time to zoom in. You can also use the \"Magnifier\" application under \"Accessories\".\nOn Mac, go to \"System Preferences\", open \"Universal Access\" and select the \"Seeing\" tab. Check the box under \"Zoom\" to \"On\".\nOn your Apple device, tap \"Settings\", then \"General\", then \"Accessibility\". Tap the \"Zoom\" button and toggle it \"On\".\nAnother trick is to use \"Ctrl\" (\"Cmd\" on Mac) plus the plus (+) or minus (-) keys when you're in a web browser.\nHow to change the colors or fonts on the page\nSome people like to change colors or fonts to see words more clearly. Most major web browsers have options to do this:\nIn Internet Explorer, go to \"Tools\", then \"Internet Options\", on to \"General\". From here, select \"Colors, Fonts, or Accessibility\".\nIn Mozilla Firefox, choose \"Options\", then \"Content\", then finally \"Fonts & Colors\".\nIn Safari, select \"Preferences\", \"Appearance\" tab, and then hit the \"Select…\" button next to the font fields.\nIn Chrome, go to \"Preferences\", activate the \"Show advanced settings\" link, go to the \"Web content\" heading and change the \"Font size\", \"Customize fonts\" in other ways, or set default \"Page zoom\".\nWe recommend a mixture of settings like enlarging font size and zooming into the browser for a better experience.\nHow to find and use a screen reader\nScreen readers are text-to-speech software that allow people to read and interact with content in different ways. Many people who cannot perceive what is on the screen will use them to allow audible access to web content. Capital One designs and codes for accessibility. We strive to ensure that our content is accessible to screen readers.\nThere are free options available including NVDA for Windows and VoiceOver for Mac. What we recommend is JAWS for Windows. You can use this with your favorite web browser.\nScreen readers accept input in a variety of ways, but one of the most common forms is through your keyboard. By pressing the down arrow in JAWS, for example, you are able navigate through items on the page. JAWS will also accept Braille input.\nThere are a lot of great features right on your smart phone. iOS and Android alike provide many tools to help you access what you love. Let’s have a look at a few of those tools.\nVoiceOver for iOS and TalkBack for Android are the screen readers that come built-in. To turn on VoiceOver, go to \"Settings\", then \"General\", to \"Accessibility\", and then turn \"VoiceOver\" on. You can set the “Accessibility Shortcut” to “VoiceOver” from the \"Accessibility\" page in order to triple-click the \"Home\" button to toggle VoiceOver on and off. TalkBack has a similar feature.\n\"Zoom\", \"Magnifier\", \"Invert Colors\", \"Color Filters\", and \"Reduce White Point\" are other features and tools on iOS that you can use. These are also available through the “Accessibility Shortcut”.",

The email is designed to trick users into providing personal information like credit card information, Social Security numbers, and login credentials. \nHow to Identify Phishing\nHere are some ways to spot potential phishing emails:\nCheck the Details. Inspect the sender’s email address and hover over (do not click) any URL links included in the message. Although the email address and URL may appear to be legitimate at first glance, this information can be spoofed or direct you to an unauthorized site.\nBeware the Scare. Scare tactics are often used to prompt victims to quickly respond to requests for personal or financial information. Email notices that threaten to close your account or impose fines or penalties should be treated as suspect.\nLook Out for Errors. Spelling, grammatical errors, and oddly structured sentences can indicate that the email is not from a legitimate source. Furthermore, emails that use generic titles (like Mr., Mrs., Sir or Madam, etc.) instead of your legal name should be treated with caution.\nGo to the Source. Phishing emails may use official logos and headers, so it can be hard to verify validity. If you ever question the legitimacy of an email, try going directly to that company's website rather than clicking links in emails or downloading attachments.\nReporting Phishing\nIf you received a suspicious email that claims to be from Capital One or misuses the Capital One brand, do not click any links contained in the message or download any attachments, and instead forward the entire email with the original subject line to abuse@capitalone.com.\nSuspicious Phone Call\nWhat is Phone Phishing?\nPhone phishing, also known as “voice phishing” or “vishing,” occurs when a fraudster calls directly and asks you to do something like provide personal information like credit card information, Social Security numbers, and login credentials.\nHow to Identify Phone Phishing\nMany of the phishing indicators also apply to vishing attacks, such as an urgent timeline or intimidating language. You can also spot phone phishing using the following helpful hints:\nDo Not Comply. If the caller leaves a message, you can listen to their message, but DO NOT comply with their demands.\nWhen In Doubt, Call It Out. It is fairly easy to spoof the number for an incoming call. If you receive a suspicious call that is claiming to be from an actual company, call the company directly to verify whether the request is legitimate. You can also search the web for the suspicious phone number to see if it routes back to a legitimate source.\nReporting Phone Phishing\nIf you receive a suspicious phone call that claims to be from Capital One, do not provide the caller with any account information, and end the call. See our Communication Guidelines below for how you can tell if the call is legitimate.\nReport the suspicious phone call to abuse@capitalone.com. Be sure to include in your email the phone number that called you and the information the person was trying to acquire.\nIf you provided a caller with information related to your account and think the inquiry was suspicious, contact us using the number on the back of your credit card.\nSuspicious Text Message\nWhat is Text Message Phishing?\nText message phishing, or “SMS phishing,” occurs when a fraudster uses text messages appearing to be from a legitimate source in order to entice individuals to reveal personal information like credit card information, Social Security numbers, and login credentials.\nHow to Identify Text Message Phishing\nDon’t Do Business Via Text. A legitimate business will never ask you to reveal your account number, user name, password, or full Social Security number via text message.\nKnow the Signs. Just as with email and phone phishing, be aware of urgent language, grammar or spelling errors, or unknown senders. Furthermore, be wary of clicking on shortened URL links like TinyURL or Bitly.\nReporting Text Message Phishing\nIf you receive a suspicious text message that claims to be from Capital One, do not reply to the message or click on any links within the message.\nInstead take a screenshot of the message and send the screenshot to abuse@capitalone.com. Be sure to include the sending phone number and the content of the message. After sending the information to Capital One abuse@capitalone.com, delete the text message from your mobile phone.\nIf you clicked a link and provided information related to your account, contact us using the number on the back of your credit card if you think the text was suspicious.\nIf you’re having issues accessing your account, please use the online Password Reset tool to reset your password. Whether you're using a mobile device or a computer, navigate to the Password Reset tool by selecting the “Forgot Username or Password?” link on the sign in page.\nOnce you have reached the Password Reset tool, complete a few security steps to reset your password and access your account.\nHere are the steps to reset the password and access your account:\n1. Go to https://verified.capitalone.com/auth/signin\n2. Select “Forgot Username or Password?” link\n3. Enter your information and select “Find Me”\n4. Complete any security steps to recover your username\n5. If you’d like to reset the password, select “Verify Me”\n6. Complete additional security steps and enter a new password\nKeep in mind: Temporary passwords expire after a period of time. Please check the email containing your temporary password to ensure it’s still valid.

  "text": "Your money is safe at Capital One\nCapital One, N.A., is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an independent federal agency. The FDIC insures balances up to $250,000 held in various types of consumer and business deposit accounts.\nCapital One customers don’t need to purchase or apply for FDIC insurance—coverage up to the FDIC’s limit is automatic whenever a deposit account is opened.\nHere’s how FDIC insurance works\nDeposits in checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit are insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank and per ownership type. \nThe amount of FDIC insurance coverage you may have depends on your account’s FDIC ownership category, such as:\nSingle account: owned by one person with no beneficiaries\nJoint account: owned by two or more people with no beneficiaries\nTrust account: owned by one or more trustees on behalf of one or more beneficiaries \nBusiness account: owned by a corporation, partnership or unincorporated association\nAll deposits that an account holder has in the same ownership category, within the same bank, are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount of $250,000. Business account deposits are also insured—up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership type—separately from the personal accounts of the business entity's stockholders, partners or members.\nCan I have more than $250,000 worth of deposit insurance at Capital One?\nYes. In some instances, account holders may be entitled to more than $250,000 of FDIC insurance. Deposits held in different ownership categories are separately insured, up to $250,000 for each, even if held at the same bank. \nHere are three examples:\nA single account titled Jane Doe would be insured up to $250,000.\nA joint account titled Jane Doe and John Smith would be insured up to $250,000 for both depositors for a total of $500,000. \nA revocable trust account with one owner naming three unique beneficiaries would be insured up to $750,000.* \n(*See “Revocable and Irrevocable Trust Accounts” for more information on how deposit insurance is calculated for these types of accounts.)\nHow do I know what’s covered?\nFor more information about the different FDIC ownership categories and the amount of coverage available to you or your beneficiaries, you can visit the FDIC’s What’s Covered page.\nYou may be able to increase your coverage under certain scenarios. To learn more about ways to increase your coverage, refer to the FDIC’s Your Insured Deposits page to view possible scenarios to maximize your coverage.",

For example, we use these tools to collect information for debugging, fraud prevention, session management, and other necessary purposes. We also use these to conduct personalization, analytics, and targeted advertising on or through the Online Services. We may associate this tracking data with your Capital One account (if you have one).\nThese tools include:\nServer logs. Server logs automatically record information and details about your online interactions with us. For example, server logs may record information about your visit to our website on a particular time and day.\nCookies. Cookies are small text files that a website’s server stores in your web browser. Cookies allow companies to recognize your device and store information about your account and preferences. For example, we may use cookies to store information about pages visited on our sites, language preferences, your relationship with us, or other information that we have associated with you or your device. You may be able to manage cookies on your device.\nPixel tags. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon, clear GIF, pixel, or tag) is an image or a small string of code that may be placed in a website, advertisement, or email. It allows companies to set or read cookies or transfer information to their servers when you load a webpage or interact with online content. For example, we or our service providers may use pixel tags to determine whether you have interacted with a specific part of our website, viewed a particular advertisement, or opened a specific email.\nSDKs and mobile advertising IDs. Our mobile applications may include third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your mobile app activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA and Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes.\nThird-party plugins. Our Online Services may include plugins from other companies, including social media companies (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button). These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the plugin. These third-party plugins are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.\nHow does Capital One use online tracking technology to conduct personalization, analytics, targeted advertising, and how can you opt out?\nWe and third-party providers acting on our behalf use online tracking technology to conduct personalization, analytics, and targeted advertising on or through the Online Services.\nPersonalization.

In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, we may use the information we collect about you online, alone or in combination with information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information, or the state in which you bank). We also use online tracking technologies to recognize your computer or device when you’re logged in, enable enhanced features or functionality, improve usability, and otherwise provide the Online Services to you.\nAnalytics. We and our third-party providers use online tracking technologies to engage in data analytics, auditing, measurement, research, reporting, and debugging on our Online Services and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising.

We and our third-party providers may collect information about your activities on our Online Services and across different websites, mobile apps, and devices over time for targeted advertising purposes. These providers may then show you ads, including across the internet and mobile apps, and other devices, based in part on the information they have collected or that we have shared with them.\nFor example, when you visit the Capital One website and explore our products, our advertising providers may use that information to determine which ads to show you when you go to other, non-Capital One websites. Similarly, when you view a Capital One ad on your computer, our advertising providers may use that information when deciding whether to show you a subsequent ad on your laptop or mobile device.

You will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete cookies, change web browsers, reset your mobile advertising ID, or use a different device, you may need to opt out again. Our Online Services do not function differently in response to browser “Do Not Track” signals, but you may opt out of certain targeted advertising as described above.\nLearn more about how we use online tracking technologies.\nManage cookies on your device\nYou may be able to set your web browser to tell you when cookies are set, delete your cookies, or block cookies altogether.

  "text": "Estimate your monthly payment by entering your loan amount, Annual Percentage Rate (APR), and loan term length.\nEstimating Your Monthly Car Payment\nShopping for a new vehicle can be stressful, especially when it comes time to calculate car payments. But with the right tools, you can simplify your car-buying process. By using an auto payment calculator, you can generate an accurate estimate for your car loan to see whether a potential purchase falls within your budget. \nWhile some calculators can be complicated to use, Capital One Auto Loan Calculator is straightforward, requiring just three key pieces of information: loan amount, term length, and annual percentage rate (APR). \nYour loan amount could either be the cost of your car or the amount you anticipate needing to borrow. Since you may plan on contributing a down payment or trading in a vehicle to lower the overall cost of the purchase, consider what your loan amount will be after these additional contributions toward your vehicle purchase. \nDepending on the length of your car loan, your monthly payment may increase or decrease. You can choose loan terms of 36, 48, 60, or 72 months to see how your monthly payment changes if your other variables stay the same. But keep in mind that while longer loan terms may have lower monthly payments, they also typically come with a higher interest rate. This means you could end up owing more over the lifetime of your loan, even as your vehicle depreciates. \nDetermining your APR will likely depend on your credit score, national rates, and other industry factors. You could get pre-qualified for a loan and receive an APR to calculate your monthly payment. Once you have an estimated APR, you can enter it into the auto payment calculator and see how it might affect your monthly payments. \nUsing these key pieces of car loan information, you can generate as many estimates as you need to inform your car-financing decision. Whether you're buying a new car or refinancing your current vehicle, using a monthly payment calculator can help you get a clearer picture of how your anticipated costs align with your budget. \nWhat is Auto Loan Interest?\nAuto loan interest is the extra cost in addition to your loan principal — your starting loan amount — that lenders charge you for borrowing money. Your interest rate is calculated as a percentage of your remaining balance of debt. Each month when you make your payment, a portion will go toward paying down your principal, while the remainder goes toward accrued interest. Once your interest rate is determined and laid out in your loan terms, your lender will calculate your interest and add it to your monthly payments. \nYour auto lender will most likely use simple interest to calculate your monthly rate. This means interest will be calculated based on the remaining car-loan balance when your monthly payment is due. Simple-interest car loans front-load your monthly interest payments, meaning you pay more toward interest at the beginning of your loan and more toward your balance at the end. Since interest is determined by your remaining monthly balance, the more you can pay toward your auto loan per month, the less interest you will pay over time. A monthly payment calculator will typically estimate your car payment using simple interest. \nAuto Loan Tips\nChecking your credit score can help you gauge your loan approval chances. Understanding your credit history and current credit score may help you make a more informed decision on your auto loan. Credit scores are a key factor when lenders are deciding whether or not to finance your car purchase, and often will determine your car loan interest rates and acceptance. Checking your credit before applying for a car loan may help you resolve any discrepancies and put you in a better position for approval. \nMaking a down payment could lead to long-term savings. Saving up for a down payment may reduce the overall costs of your auto loan. Down payments not only help lower your monthly payments, they could also reduce your total auto loan interest. Most experts recommend a 20% down payment for new cars and 10% for used. \nGetting pre-approval might provide clarity on potential interest rates. Pre-approved auto loans can provide insight into the potential interest rate your lender will be able to offer. If the estimate doesn't match your budget, you have the option to look for financing options elsewhere. However, keep in mind that pre-approval often requires a hard credit check that could impact your credit score if you don't make a financing decision quickly. \nShopping around for car loans could lead to savings. Shopping for car loans could potentially hurt your credit through multiple hard credit pulls, but taking advantage of rate-shopping windows could help you get the information you need with minimal impact on your credit. Credit scoring companies like TransUnion allow car shoppers a 14-day grace period, during which multiple credit checks can count as one. Using this window to get the information you need can help you apply for a loan that best suits your budget.",

  "text": "1. \nWhat is a credit report and how can I get a copy? \nCredit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian, and Transunion, create your credit report, which is a detailed report of your credit history based on information that’s been provided to CRAs by “furnishers” like lenders and auto finance companies. Credit reports contain a range of information—everything from personal details like names and Social Security numbers to specifics about auto loan payments and repossessions. It gives a view of your overall credit and debt history, like how often you make payments on time, how much credit you have, and how much credit you're using. Reviewing credit reports helps lenders decide if they will loan money to you and what interest rates and other terms they will offer.\nYou can get a free copy of your credit report from CRAs directly or at AnnualCreditReport.com. Learn more about how to check your credit report.\n2. \nWhat is the role of credit reporting agencies and Capital One Auto Finance in determining what information is shown on my credit report? \nCredit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, prepare your credit report. A CRA receives credit information from “furnishers,” like lenders and auto finance companies, that extend credit. Information provided by furnishers, including Capital One Auto Finance, must be accurate and complete. We furnish information on payment history, such as whether you made your payment on time or late. On a monthly basis, we notify the CRAs that accounts 30 days or more past due are delinquent. If applicable, we may also include an account’s status, such as whether a vehicle was repossessed or an account was paid in full or settled in full for less than the full balance. \n3. \nWhen and how do auto financing credit inquiries show up on my credit report?\nIf you sign a credit application for auto financing at a dealership, the dealer may submit your credit application to multiple lenders. Lenders who receive your application may submit a request to the credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, to view your credit report. These inquiries generate a hard credit check (also known as a \"pull,\" \"inquiry\" or \"hit\") and may be visible on your credit report for two years, even for the lenders who do not fund your loan. Note that when multiple lender credit checks occur within a certain timing window—typically within 14 to 45 days—CRAs may lump them together, counting them as one credit check.\nIf you request pre-qualification for auto financing or refinancing from Capital One online, we will submit a soft credit check to the CRA(s). Soft credit checks are only visible to you on credit reports and don’t impact your credit score.\n4. \nHow long does my auto loan information stay on my credit report?\nCredit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, decide when, how, and for how long the information furnished to the CRA will display on your credit report. CRAs determine how long they will report information about a specific account (i.e., tradeline), as permitted by law. Late payment information could remain on a credit report for up to 7 years; account statuses in certain situations (e.g., bankruptcy) could remain on a credit report for up to 10 years. \nOf important note, delinquent payment history is not deleted from your credit report once you become current, pay your balance in full, or settle an account for less than the full balance owed. In other words, your past negative payment history is not replaced by future positive payment history. This is one reason why it is very important to make each and every monthly payment on time.\n5. \nCan I get a late auto payment taken off my credit report?\nOn a monthly basis, Capital One Auto Finance notifies credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, that accounts 30 or more days past due are delinquent. CRAs typically display this late payment information on a credit report where it can remain for as long as 7 years. Note that neither you, nor credit repair companies acting on your behalf, have a right to have late payment information removed from credit reports if it is accurate. \n6. \nHow can I dispute information on my credit report if I believe it’s inaccurate or incomplete? \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you the right to dispute information you believe to be incomplete or inaccurate and requires furnishers like Capital One Auto Finance to conduct reasonable investigations of disputes. If you believe that the late payment shown on your credit report is inaccurately reported, you can file a dispute with us or through the credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.\nWe will investigate your dispute using the information provided, and respond within 30 days. If any changes are deemed necessary, note that the CRAs will typically update your credit report(s) within 1-2 billing cycles after the investigation is complete. \nFiling a Dispute with Capital One Auto Finance\nWhen filing your dispute, we strongly encourage you to provide us with the specific information you believe was inaccurately or incompletely reported (such as payment dates or account status), and include supporting information that would help in the investigation (e.g., front and back of check, bank statement, marked-up copy of the credit report, etc.). We recommend downloading and completing our Credit Report Dispute Form and providing all relevant information that explains your situation. Please send your dispute and supporting materials directly to Capital One Auto Finance at the address listed below:\nATTN: COAF Credit Bureau Dispute\nCapital One Auto Finance\nPO Box 259407\nPlano, TX 75025-9407\nFiling a Dispute with the CRAs\nEquifax: (866) 349-5191\nExperian: (888) 397-3742\nTransUnion: (800) 916-8800\nIf you choose to file a dispute with the CRAs, note that dispute-related communications will come from the CRAs, not Capital One.\n7. \nFact or Fiction? Late payments, even when accurately reported, can be removed by simply filing disputes using specific forms and citing certain laws, or by repeatedly submitting the same dispute.\nFiction!\nAs a lender that furnishes information to credit reporting agencies (CRAs), like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, we have a responsibility to furnish customers’ account and payment information accurately and completely. Please be wary of any online sources or “credit repair” companies advising you to seek removal of accurately reported information by claiming we are violating your Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) or privacy rights by accurately furnishing your information. These companies may even charge you to use their dispute or complaint templates. Note that neither you, nor credit repair companies acting on your behalf, have a right to have late payment information removed from credit reports if it is accurate. Click here to learn more about the following warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: “[b]eware of anyone who claims that they can remove information from your credit report that’s current, accurate and negative. It’s probably a credit repair scam.”\nPlease also understand that when Capital One Auto Finance receives a dispute or complaint related to credit reporting, we conduct an investigation and inform you of the results. Repeatedly submitting the same dispute information without additional supporting documents, even if you do so through different channels, will not change the outcome of our investigation. \n8. \nFact or Fiction? You don’t have to pay back the amount you financed at the terms you agreed to and therefore late payments cannot be reported.\nFiction!\nThere are various theories (often referred to as \"freeman on the land\" or “freeman”-style theories) circulating on social media or elsewhere that allege a borrower is not responsible for repaying the amount they financed. These theories can take different forms, but they are based on flawed arguments. Capital One Auto Finance will not forgive your account balance simply because you submit a freeman-style dispute or complaint. Be wary of any online sources or companies advising you to file disputes claiming that your auto loan debt is invalid under a “freeman” theory. Click here to learn more about the following warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: “[b]eware of anyone who claims that they can remove information from your credit report that’s current, accurate and negative. It’s probably a credit repair scam.”\n9. \nWhat should I do if I think my identity has been stolen?\nIf you are a victim of identity theft, you can file a report with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and with the police. If you notify Capital One Auto Finance of your identity theft claim, please provide supporting documentation, such as an FTC or police report and proof of your identity. We might request that you provide additional supporting documentation beyond these items to assist with our investigation. Once we have completed our investigation, we will notify you of our findings and any action we may take. \nPlease be wary of any online sources recommending you file a false claim of identity theft in order to avoid paying debts owed or to prevent accurate information from appearing on your credit report. Click here to learn more about the following warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: “[b]eware of anyone who claims that they can remove information from your credit report that’s current, accurate and negative. It’s probably a credit repair scam.”\n10. \nHow can I improve my credit score?\nThere are no quick fixes or shortcuts when it comes to boosting your credit score. But if you’re using credit responsibly, you’re on the right track. If you want an idea where you stand, you can use a tool like CreditWise from Capital One. It’s free to all—whether you’re a Capital One customer or not. And using it to check your credit won’t hurt your score.",

Shopping for a used car can seem like a challenge, and you're not alone if you feel this way. Arming yourself with strong questions could help you know what you're getting into.\nWhen shopping around, don't be afraid to grill a salesperson. Off the bat they may lack answers, but that's nothing a little digging on their part can't solve. What about questions to ask when buying a used car from a private party? The good news is that private-party sellers may know more about their cars than dealers do. After all, they've probably been driving the vehicle for a while, and in some cases, they may even have owned it since new.\nHere's a look at several important questions to ask when buying a used car from either a dealer or private party.\nWhat Is the Car's History?\nWhile you can't expect a salesperson to know the history of every vehicle on a big lot, it's always worth asking them what they know about the car. Maybe they handled the trade and can provide some hints about how the previous owners used it. Or they can tell you if it was acquired, as so many cars are, at a dealer-only auction.\nYou'll have better luck with this question in a private-party sale. When inquiring, you're looking to learn about when the seller acquired the car and how they used it. If they were not the vehicle's first owner, they may be able to tell you a little about its past prior to their acquisition. A history of garage storage—as well as whether the car has seen more highway, suburban, or urban use—can be highly desirable.\nAre Any Service Records Included?\nAsking this question can tell you a lot about how fastidious the previous owner has been. Meticulous maintenance with documentation shows an owner who cared about their vehicle and was willing to spend money to keep it going. While you needn't write off a dealer or seller who is unable to provide receipts, the car may need a little more stringent inspection should you choose to go see it.\nHas The Car Been Wrecked or Previously Stolen?\nA \"yes\" to either of these does not have to automatically lead to a \"no\" from you, but it should open some follow-up questions, such as the severity of damages incurred and extensiveness of repairs. Documentation for these items is critical as it can be hard to take a seller at their word.\nIf the car was previously wrecked or stolen and recovered, you'll want to inspect the title closely to ensure it is \"clean,\" meaning the car has not been issued a salvage title at the behest of an insurance company.\nMay I Have a Vehicle History Report?\nTwo major firms provide vehicle history reports that can detail where a car was registered throughout its life, give you a glimpse into its service history, and tell you if it was ever in a wreck or had its odometer altered. Carfax is costlier and more comprehensive than AutoCheck, but using both in tandem can uncover a lot about a car.\nDealers typically provide one or both, but you may need to request the data. Be wary of a dealer who is unwilling to provide a history report. Don't worry if the Carfax or AutoCheck data makes no mention of service history. Not all shops or dealerships report information to those organizations.\nPrivate-party sellers will sometimes provide a Carfax or AutoCheck history report. If they choose not to do so, the seller can provide you with the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) so you can purchase one yourself. While not a car's biography, such documentation often reveals a lot about a vehicle—and it can tell you if the seller has been truthful.\nWhat Problems Have You Had With the Car?\nThis really just applies to private-party sales, but there aren't too many used cars in perfect condition, so let this question rip. Odds are the owner has had at least an item or two repaired, which can add to your pre-purchase peace of mind. There's no reason to fear recent major fixes—if anything, evidence of such work can save you thousands in the long run because someone else took care of those gremlins for you.\nA follow-up to this question can include asking whether there are any open recalls—that is, recalls up to 15 years old left unaddressed. If the seller is unsure (or you want to be certain for yourself), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) maintains a database of open and completed recalls that you can access using the car's VIN.\nAre There Any Current Problems?\nHere's where you can start putting your negotiator's hat on. Hopefully, the seller will disclose any issues even before you go to see the car.\nIf there are smaller issues—especially wear items such as tires or brakes that will eventually need to be replaced on any car—you can do a little research ahead of time to determine the cost of replacement. Armed with that knowledge, you can try to negotiate a lower price.\nWhat Else Is Included With the Car?\nA new car comes with more than just a key. A well-kept used car should retain two keys and remote fobs (if applicable), as well as the owner manuals. These items are important to have, but can be expensive to recover if they've gone missing—modern keys can cost upward of $500 to replace.\nAdditional items to consider include floor mats (both carpeted and winter-ready rubber), roof rack cross bars, luggage covers, or winter wheels and tires. While many dealers will discard service records for privacy reasons, some will provide you with redacted documentation—or at least be able to print out a car's service history if it was maintained in their shop.\nCareful private sellers will likely include the owner's manual and extra keys. Additional items can obviously vary by car, but it's better to ask than not for extras. Furthermore, you can ask if the seller has kept the original window sticker—the federally-mandated document that was affixed to the car's window when it was new. This lists out the vehicle's original specification, including major factory-installed options. This can be useful when comparing cars, and again, it shows the owner may have been meticulous with their vehicle.\nWhat Service Did You Perform to Prepare the Car for Sale?\nA traded-in vehicle is rarely immediately ready to go to a used-car lot, as are many private-party, pre-owned vehicles. Dealerships typically perform at least some servicing, and they will normally be able to provide documentation. The best private sellers do this, too. An oil change and replacement of wiper blades sounds basic, but may save you some money. Bigger work, such as installation of new tires, brake pads and rotors, or even regularly scheduled maintenance, may save you thousands. This kind of work is worth factoring into the price you want to pay for the car.\nIs There a Warranty?\nThere are three kinds of warranties you may find on a used car.\nThe remainder of a factory warranty: A relatively new used car may still have some coverage provided by the manufacturer. A call to the manufacturer's customer service line can verify how much is left.\nA Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) warranty: On a car that has passed a manufacturer-backed CPO inspection, this warranty can provide similar coverage to the factory warranty for as much as two years depending on the brand.\nA dealership-provided warranty: Many dealers will include a short-term warranty—typically three or six months—that can cover certain repairs. While not particularly comprehensive, and often served with strings attached, these warranties can offer peace of mind as long as you've read the fine print first.\nCan I Have an Independent, Pre-Purchase Inspection Performed?\nIf you find that you like the car, a pre-purchase inspection (PPI) from a trustworthy mechanic or repair shop can be worth its weight in gold, as it can determine any underlying issues not immediately visible to an untrained eye.\nA transparent seller should be willing to have such an inspection performed, though typically it is the potential buyer's responsibility to pay for this.\nCan I Return the Car if I Don't Like It?\nYou might be surprised with the answer to this one. Many dealerships have a policy that will let you return a car within a few days (and a few hundred miles) if for some reason you decide it's not the vehicle for you. That said, you can save yourself the hassle by asking about an extended overnight test drive.\nIt should go without saying that posing this question to a private seller won't go over so well. In fact, you might be surprised with the answer, but not in a positive way.\nWritten by humans. \nEdited by humans. \nThis site is for educational purposes only.

The credit is often extended on an open account and payable via an invoice or statement, which can be paper or digital.\nHow is the solution from Capital One Trade Credit different from a credit card?\nA credit card is a payment method used for making purchases at many vendor companies. It comes with a summary statement bill (with no purchase detail), which is payable all in one cycle or revolves with an APR fee. The credit line can be shared for all purchasing needs, which can limit available credit for business purchases with any one supplier. Capital One Trade Credit provides an open account between the seller and buyer with a dedicated line of credit for that purchasing relationship. It's underwritten on the business with a business-sized credit line. It can be billed by invoice for each purchase or as a monthly statement, which does provide purchase detail such as Level III data. Our solution also provides all necessary support, such as real-time decisioning, cardless omnichannel purchasing, upfront funding on the sale, billing, servicing, collections, cash app (to support the entire AR lifecycle) and account management tools for merchants and their customers.\nHow is the solution from Capital One Trade Credit different from factoring?\nWith factoring, a company sells its invoices or AR to a third party, which provides cash up front to the company and then tracks down payment on the invoices. With our solution, we manage your AR for you and pay you up front, but we don’t purchase your invoices or AR. Instead, we partner with you through the longer term and manage all steps throughout your AR lifecycle. That includes mitigating credit risk and using technology and people to grow sales, improve processes and remove friction in the overall B2B experience. We also offer underwriting for customers and funding for merchants, which is not provided by factoring companies.\nHow is the solution from Capital One Trade Credit different from automated AR software?\nAutomated AR software typically only specializes in one or two areas of AR, such as invoicing and payment portals. Capital One Trade Credit offers a full-service AR solution—everything from credit application decisioning and underwriting to invoice generation, cash application and collections. We can also service your customer base, reduce risk and provide fraud monitoring.\nArticle|May 21, 2024\n|7 min read \nArticle|May 20, 2024\n|7 min read \nArticle|May 17, 2024\n|4 min read",

Kids can sign in and check their balance online 24/7, but transferring money requires a little help from the adult on the account.

Pay your bills, get cash, make deposits, and transfer money—all without monthly fees and extra trips to the bank. You can open a checking account online and manage your account securely by signing in on your phone or computer, instead of waiting for the bank to open first. And if you ever need help with your account, a real person is just a phone call away.\nThere are no fees to open, keep or use your Capital One 360 Checking account, or for foreign transactions. There may be some things you want or need to do with your account that will result in charges.

  "text": "Wire Transfer Disclosure Statement\nIn this Wire Transfer Disclosure Statement and Agreement (this \"Agreement\"), the words \"you\" and \"your\" mean the account owner, and the words \"us,\" \"we,\" and \"our\" mean Capital One, N.A. This Agreement defines your responsibilities and our responsibilities with respect to domestic transfers of funds from your account(s) with us for credit to an account at another financial institution or another account with us (“Wire Transfer”). You understand that, except as specifically modified by this Agreement, your account(s) will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions contained in other agreements and/or disclosures that you have been provided with in connection with your account(s), which are incorporated herein by reference. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as set forth in Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code and, to the extent applicable, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and its implementing regulations.\nHow to request a wire transfer: To send a wire transfer, log in to initiate a wire request (“Wire Money”) using our online wire form. The beneficiary and dollar amount for a Wire Transfer under this agreement may be limited. These limits are designed to be flexible in order to protect the security and integrity of the service and accounts, as well as you and all other users of the service. Based on confidential fraud and essential risk criteria, they may be modified at our discretion without advance notice. The types of wire transfers that can be initiated, the eligible recipients, and applicable limits will be identified to you when you set up a Wire Transfer online. We reserve the right to reject any Wire Transfer Request. We may restrict the use of wire transfers for new accounts and newly added joint account holders.\nMethod used to execute the wire transfer: We may select any means for the transmission of funds that we consider suitable, including but not limited to Fedwire. We may make use of correspondents, agents, subagents, and funds transfer and communication systems. Such third parties shall be deemed your agents, and we shall not be liable for any errors, delay, misdelivery, or failure of delivery by any of them unless applicable law says otherwise.\nCut-off times: We have cut-off hours for processing Wire Transfers. If a wire request is received by 2:00pm ET and verified through our security procedures outlined in the section below titled “Security Procedures,” funds will be processed the same business day. If it is received after 2:00pm ET and verified through our security procedures, funds may be processed the next business day. We may treat any Wire Transfer Request received at or after our cut-off time as if it was received that business day, or we may treat it as if it were received at the opening of the next business day.\nSecurity procedures: You agree and consent to the use of certain security procedures by us to confirm the validity of the Wire Transfer Request made pursuant to this Agreement. You understand the security procedures are not designed to detect errors in the content of the Wire Transfer Request or to prevent duplicate transfers. Some elements of the procedures will vary, depending upon the method used to initiate a Wire Transfer. You hereby agree that your utilization of any security procedure established hereunder shall constitute your agreement to its use and affirmative acknowledgment of its commercial reasonableness. You further agree that any Wire Transfer Request that is acted upon in good faith by us in compliance with these security procedures, whether or not in fact authorized by you, shall constitute an authorized Wire Transfer. The following security procedures shall apply to this Agreement: Before accepting any such Wire Transfer Requests, we will: (1) perform verification on the individuals initiating the Wire Transfer Request that is designed to ensure they are the individuals previously authorized to initiate a Wire Transfer for the account in question; (2) apply fraud-related screens to the wire instructions; (3) contact you using information from your account records to verify the Wire Transfer for wires that are not initiated in person (this contact may be through a method different than the one you used to request the Wire Transfer (e.g., phone versus e-mail) or it may be through the same channel to obtain a password or other information that only you should have); (4) request and receive any other proof of identification or any other documentation from you or your authorized representative, which we may, in our sole discretion, require under the circumstances; and (5) you expressly agree to receive security alerts from us by prerecorded voice message and/or text message, including with the use of an automatic dialer (autodialer), at any mobile device number you provide to us.\nForce majeure: We will not be liable for our inability to perform our obligations under this Agreement when such inability arises out of causes beyond our control, including but not limited to, any act of God, accident, labor disputes, power failures, system failure, equipment malfunction, suspension of payment by another bank, refusal or delay by another bank to accept the wire transfer, war, emergency conditions, fire, earthquake, or the failure of any third party to provide any electronic or telecommunication service used in connection with the execution or cancellation of a Wire Transfer.\nInconsistency of name and account number: You acknowledge and agree that when you (or your authorized representative) provide us with a name and account number in order for us to process a Wire Transfer, payment may be made by the beneficiary's/designated recipient's bank solely on the basis of the account number, even if the account number identifies a person different from the beneficiary so named. We or an intermediary bank may send a Wire Transfer to an intermediary bank or beneficiary's/designated recipient's bank based solely on the bank identifying number, even if the payment order indicates a different name. We may rely on all information contained in the Wire Transfer Request, regardless of who may have provided the information. You further agree that your obligation to pay the amount of a Wire Transfer to us is not excused in such circumstances. Except as provided by applicable law, any losses resulting from an incorrect account number or your misidentification of the beneficiary/designated recipient is your responsibility and not ours.\nAcceptance and execution of request by Capital One: A Wire Transfer Request is considered accepted by us when we execute it. Please refer to the “Cut-Off Times” section for more details. You can verify whether your Wire Transfer Request has been executed by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nPayment to Capital One: You must pay us the amount of the Wire Transfer, plus any applicable fees, before we will execute the Wire Transfer Request. Please contact the Call Center for fees applicable to Wire Transfers and any other related pre-payment disclosures.\nRejection of a wire transfer: We have no responsibility to accept any incoming Wire Transfer(s) for your benefit. Likewise, we have a right to reject any Wire Transfer Request(s) for an outgoing Wire Transfer for reasons including, but not limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account specified in the Wire Transfer Request, a request that fails the security procedures outlined in the section on Security Procedures, our inability to execute the Wire Transfer for the reasons set out in the section of this agreement entitled Method Used to Make the Wire Transfer above, or if we are unable to verify the authenticity of the Wire Transfer Request. If we stop a domestic outgoing Wire Transfer, we will refund the fee.\nNotice of a wire transfer not executed: If we determine, in our sole discretion, not to honor, execute, or accept a Wire Transfer Request, we will endeavor to notify you, but we shall have no liability for delay or failure to do so. We will also endeavor to notify you promptly if a Wire Transfer is returned to us after its execution but shall have no liability by reason of our delay or failure to do so. We shall have no obligation to resend a Wire Transfer if we complied with the original Wire Transfer Request and such Wire Transfer was returned to us.\nCancellation or amendment of wire transfer: Once we receive a Wire Transfer Request, it may not be able to be canceled or amended. However, at our discretion, we may use reasonable efforts to act on any request for cancellation or amendment, provided that the method by which we are notified of a request for cancellation or amendment complies with our security procedures. However, we shall have no liability if such cancellation or amendment is not affected. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, damages, costs, and expenses we may incur in attempting to cancel or amend the Wire Transfer. Any cancellation or amendment of a Wire Transfer by us shall relieve us of any obligation to act on the original Wire Transfer Request.\nAccount statements: Except as provided by applicable law, you agree that we are not required to provide you with a separate notice of incoming or outgoing Wire Transfer. All Wire Transfers will be reflected on your periodic bank statement. You should review your statement for any discrepancies, unauthorized transactions, or errors in connection with any Wire Transfers. Except as otherwise provided herein, if you think a Wire Transfer is wrong or if you need more information about a Wire Transfer, you must contact us in writing upon discovery of the error or within fourteen (14) days from the date your statement is postmarked or otherwise made available to you, whichever is earlier. Failure to do so will relieve us of any obligation to pay interest on the amount of an unauthorized or erroneous Wire Transfer for which we are liable. Furthermore, you will also be liable to us for any damages or losses we may incur as a result of your failure to notify us within the time period stated in this section.\nChange in authorized representative: Any changes in the authority of persons authorized to make a Wire Transfer on your behalf shall not be binding upon us until we have received written notice from you. The notice must be in a form acceptable to us and be given within a reasonable period of time for us to act upon the change.\nDuty of reasonable care: We shall exercise good faith and reasonable care in processing Wire Transfer Requests. You shall similarly exercise good faith and reasonable care in observing and maintaining security procedures, in communicating Wire Transfer Requests to us, and in reviewing periodic bank statements for any discrepancies.\nLiability of Capital One: We shall be responsible only for performing the Wire Transfer Service expressly provided for in this Agreement; provided however, we shall be liable only for our own gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing such service. We shall not be liable to any third party or for any act or omission of yours or any third party, including, but not limited to, third parties used by us in executing a Wire Transfer or performing a related act and no such third party shall be deemed to be our agent. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WIRE TRANSFER SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SAME. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the maximum period for which we shall be liable for interest on any amount to be refunded or paid to you with respect to an unauthorized, erroneous, or other Wire Transfer Request is thirty days.\nInterest compensation: In the event we are liable to you for interest compensation under this Agreement, or applicable law, interest shall be calculated at the average of the federal funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank for the period involved; or at such other rate that we may agree to, in writing, from time to time.\nLiability of the customer: Except as otherwise provided by law, you shall be liable for any loss or damage to which your negligence contributed or which resulted in unauthorized, fraudulent, or dishonest acts by your current and/or former authorized representatives. Such liability includes instances when a current or former authorized representative effects one or more Wire Transfers or improper use of telephone security procedures to effect a Wire Transfer to your detriment.\nCompliance with anti-money laundering and exchange control regulations and OFAC enforced sanctions: You covenant with us to observe all Anti-Money Laundering and Exchange Control laws and regulations including economic and trade sanctions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury in relation to any Wire Transfer, and you will use all reasonable endeavors to assist us to do likewise. In particular, you covenant that the information given to us by you is accurate. We may disclose any information given to us that we in our sole discretion think necessary or desirable to disclose; except we will only disclose confidential information if required by law, a court, or legal, regulatory, or governmental authority, or as permitted by law in order to combat, prevent, or investigate issues arising under anti-money laundering laws, economic sanctions, or criminal law.\nSometimes legal, regulatory, or governmental authorities require additional information, either in respect of individuals, entities, or particular transactions. You agree to promptly supply all such information, which any such authority may require, and/or which we may be required to supply, in relation to the individual, entity, or particular transaction.\nIf you, or your authorized representative, breach any such laws or regulations, you irrevocably agree that we may retain any monies or funds transmitted to us pursuant to this Agreement and/or not fulfill any Wire Transfer Request if we are required to take or refrain from such action by any legal, regulatory, or governmental authority or if we reasonably believe that such action may violate any laws or regulations described herein, and such monies shall not bear interest against us. You further agree that we may pay such monies to the appropriate legal, regulatory, or governmental authority, if and when required by law.\nIndemnification: In consideration of Capital One agreeing to accept Wire Transfer Requests in the manner set forth herein, you shall forever indemnify and hold Capital One, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, successors, predecessors, representatives, principals, agents, assigns, parents, subsidiaries and/or insurers harmless from and against all liability, claims, damages, costs, claims, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that we may incur without regard to the merit or lack thereof, arising out of, or related in any way to the matters set forth herein, or to the Wire Transfer Service, which shall be provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Your agreement to indemnify us and hold us harmless shall survive the expiration and/or termination of this Agreement and all provisions contained herein.\nRecording of communication: You agree that all telephone conversations made in connection with the Agreement may be recorded and retained by us.\nTermination of agreement: We may terminate the right to make Wire Transfers at any time or amend or change the terms of this Agreement or cancel this Agreement without advance notice to you.\nAgreement controls: Both you and Capital One will be bound by this Agreement. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and something said by one of our employees, you agree that this Agreement controls. This Agreement and the terms of the Account Agreement(s) related to your deposit accounts, which are incorporated herein by reference, constitute the entire Agreement between you and us regarding your use of the Wire Transfer Service. If any inconsistency exists between the account disclosure statements and agreement(s) and this Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control. No representation or statement not expressly contained in this Agreement or in any amendment hereto shall be binding upon you or us.\nGoverning law: All actions arising out of or concerning the Wire Transfer Service or these terms and conditions shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury. In any such action, Capital One shall be entitled to its reasonable attorneys' fees. The Wire Transfer Service and these terms and conditions shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Virginia without regard to its conflicts of rules and the laws of the United States.\nSeverability: In the event that any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of the Agreement is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.",

  "text": "360 Certificate of Deposit agreement\nThe basics: Here's a quick overview of how your account works. You can open an account in your name alone or in your name and the name of one other person. You \"link\" your Capital One account to a personal (non-business) checking or savings account at another U.S. chartered bank (\"Linked Account\") to fund your CD account. Or you can transfer money from an eligible Capital One checking or savings account to fund your CD. It's that simple!\nNow that you have the basics, here are the detailed Terms that govern your Capital One account. Please understand that when you submit an application, open an account or use our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. When you see the words \"you\" and \"your,\" they mean each person who owns an account or each trustee who is legally entitled to manage an account. \"Our,\" \"us,\" and \"we\" mean Capital One, N.A.\nWho can open an account: You must be a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident with a U.S. physical address located in one of the 50 United States or Washington, D.C., or with military addresses (APO or FPO). In order to open an account, you must be at least 18 years old with a valid Social Security Number, and with a U.S.-based mobile phone number. Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) are acceptable for account opening in Branches and Capital One Cafés and your Linked Account must be with a bank chartered in the U.S.\nHow to open an account: You must electronically transfer money from your Linked Account. Your 360 CD account won’t be considered “opened” until it’s funded and you complete our verification procedures.\nAccount limits: We reserve the right to limit the number of accounts you may open at our discretion and without advanced notice.\nObtaining credit reports: We may request a consumer (credit) report in connection with your account(s). Upon your request, you will be informed whether or not a consumer (credit) report was requested, and if such report was requested, informed of the name and address of the consumer (credit) reporting agency that furnished the report. We may also request subsequent consumer (credit) reports for all legitimate purposes in connection with updating, renewing, reviewing, modifying, and/or taking collection action on your account(s).\nReporting information to consumer reporting agencies and check verifications systems: We may report information about your account to consumer reporting agencies and/or check verification systems. Defaults on your account may be reflected in your consumer report. This could affect your ability to open accounts in the future. In the event we report your account to a check verification system, you acknowledge that even if you pay us all amounts owed, we are not required to remove an accurate report of account mishandling from any such check verification system.\nConsumer account: Your 360 CD account is a consumer account and must be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If you fail to comply with these conditions, or use your account for business purposes, we may restrict use of, or close your account.\nTypes of account ownership:\nIndividual account. This type of account is owned by one person only.\nJoint account. This type of account is owned by two or more people and all deposits made into the account are owned by all registered account owners. Except for certain retirement benefits like Social Security, if one person dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). The owners of the account are considered to be \"joint tenants\" with right of survivorship. Any owner of the account may: (i) early withdraw and close the account without the other owner's consent; (ii) pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us.\nIf one joint owner requests that we not pay items authorized by a different joint owner, we may restrict the account and refuse to pay all items (including items authorized by the owner making the request), but we are not required to do so. If we restrict the account, we may not release the restriction unless all joint owners agree in writing to remove it. No request to restrict the account will affect items that we paid before the request. If we decide not to restrict the account, all joint owners remain responsible for items subtracted from the account.\nWe may also pay all or any part of the funds in the account to a court or government agency if we receive a garnishment, levy or similar legal process that identifies any of the joint owners.\nJoint account with minor. This type of account is owned by one minor (under age 18) and one adult, and the owners of the account are called \"joint tenants.\" If the minor is 12 years of age or younger, then a parent or legal guardian must be a joint owner. Except for certain benefits like Social Security, if one account holder dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). Any owner of the account may transfer funds without the other owner's consent, but only the Adult account holder may withdraw funds to another bank.\nRevocable living trust (also known as inter-vivos trust) account. This type of account is owned by a living trust and is managed by one or more Trustee(s) (“Trustee/Co-Trustees”). If the Trust requires Co-Trustees to act jointly, all Co-Trustees acknowledge that we cannot comply with multiple-signature requirements, and that each Trustee has obtained the necessary consent before performing a transaction. For example, this means that any Co-Trustee may: (i) tell us to pay a person or company; (ii) withdraw or transfer the balance without the other Co-Trustees providing consent to Capital One; (iii) make deposits, close or pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us; or (iv) endorse and deposit checks payable to either Co-Trustee or the living trust. Each Co-Trustee can enter a stop payment order on any payments or other orders of withdrawal authorized by either Co-Trustee. Each Co-Trustee understands and agrees that (s)he, and not Capital One, owes a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of the living trust and as such, shall manage the account in accordance with the terms of the trust document(s) and any applicable laws.\n“Payable on Death” (POD): You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. Only an individual may be designated as a beneficiary. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nConnecting accounts: If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will automatically \"connect\" your eligible accounts so they appear when you're logged into your account through the website or mobile app.\nWe will display only summary information about your \"connected\" accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts and people with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nThings you tell us to do: We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes: You must notify us of any change of address by calling us, or using our secure website. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you've told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (\"USPS\") or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.\nCommunication: You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us), and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nWhile we may be able to provide some customer assistance in languages other than English, we cannot guarantee that customer service will always be available in languages other than English. As a courtesy, we may translate some of our forms, letters and disclosures, including this agreement, into another language. However, many important bank documents, and some products and services related to this account, are provided only in English.\nClosing an account: You can close your account at any time, for any reason. We can close your account at any time, for any reason and without advance notice.\nState laws (called “escheat” or unclaimed property laws) require us to close all your deposit accounts and transfer your money to the state if your accounts are dormant for a period of time as defined by your state of residence. Your account can become dormant if, for 24 months, there is no transactional activity. Your account will remain dormant until funds are transferred to or from the dormant account. If all of your accounts become dormant, you may no longer receive paper statements, but you can still view your accounts online.\nState abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable state. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products are subject to abandoned property laws, including IRAs and CDs. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. We want you to keep your money, not the state! You can avoid the transfer of your money to the state simply by signing into your account, transacting periodically, contacting us, or replying to any abandoned property correspondence.\nAdditional disclosures\nAssignment: No part of an account may be pledged, assigned, given as a gift, or otherwise transferred to a third party without our prior written consent.\nItems sent via mail: Please note that we do not accept mailed-in deposits, and we are not responsible for any items sent to us via mail.\nLien and Set-Off: Unless otherwise prohibited by law, by opening an account, you grant us a security interest (in other words, a \"Lien\") in your deposit accounts with us. That means that at any time and without notice to you, we can use all or any part of the money from your individual or joint accounts to pay any amounts you owe us or any of our affiliates from time to time. (This is what's known as a \"Set-Off\"). Any Set-Off shall be a lawful and valid payment by you of amounts you owe us.\nChange to/waiver of terms: We can add to, delete or make any other changes we want to these Terms at any time. You will be bound by the Changes as soon as we implement them. We will provide advance notice of the change if the law requires us to do so. However, if applicable law requires us to make a Change, you may not receive any prior notice. We can cancel, change or add products, accounts or services whenever we want. We can waive any of our rights under these Terms whenever we want, but this doesn't mean that we'll waive the same rights in the future.\nNo fiduciary obligation: Capital One doesn't assume any fiduciary obligation on your behalf. This means that we don't act as your trustee or financial advisor, and we don't assume any responsibility for your account beyond reasonable care.\nGoverning law and regulations: Your accounts are subject to both federal law and the laws of the state of Virginia, as well as any operating circulars or clearing house rules that apply to us and the rules and regulations of our supervisory authorities (collectively, \"Applicable Laws\"). If there's a conflict between these Terms and Applicable Laws, these Terms will be changed to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Law. If any provision of these Terms is determined by a Court or administrative agency having proper jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, that determination will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.\nLevies, attachments, and other court processes: If we receive a levy, attachment, or other Court process against you or another owner of the account, we may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your account until the legal action is dismissed or satisfied. Any levy, attachment, or other Court process will be subject to our rights of Lien and Set-Off (remember, we talked about these things earlier). You are responsible for any losses, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your account.\nClaims against your account: If we receive a claim against funds in your account, or if we know of or believe that there's a dispute over the ownership or control of funds in your account, we may, if we choose to, place a hold on your account. We can also refuse to pay out any of your funds until we're satisfied that the dispute is settled. We may also close the account and send the balance to the account holder(s) we have on record, decide to rely on our current account records, require a Court Order to act, or take any other action that we feel will protect us. We won't be liable to you for taking any such action.\nDeath, incapacity or termination: If you die or are declared legally incompetent, or, in the case of a living trust account, the living trust is terminated, we can continue to accept and process deposits to your account until we know about the death/incompetency/termination and have a reasonable chance to act.\nNotices to you or us: We shall deem any and all notices to us effective upon receipt by us. Any notice that we give to you will be effective when mailed or electronically transmitted to you at the mailing/email address reflected in our records. Even though we may have provided you account opening disclosures in a language other than English, we may continue to provide you with notices/communications in English. Notice to any one owner of an account constitutes notice to all owners of that account.\nJury trial waiver: All actions arising out of this agreement or concerning your checking account shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury.\nEvents beyond our control: We'll make all reasonable efforts to give you access to your accounts and accurate information. However, you agree that we're not responsible for any interruption in service or loss caused by things that are beyond our control, such as natural disasters, wars, riots, strikes, computer failures, or losses of power, communications or transportation facilities. We won't be responsible for any direct losses or damages resulting from use of the account, unless we were negligent or acted in bad faith. We're never responsible for any indirect, special or consequential losses or damages.",

  "text": "The \"Send Money with Zelle®\" (person-to-person transfers) feature is available for Young Adults 13 and older within the mobile experience, and only upon consent of the Adult. The Young Adult can send up to $500 per day via Zelle® unless this limit is lowered by the Adult. The Young Adult cannot use the feature if the Adult revokes or removes permission. When the Young Adult reaches the age of 18, the limit set by the Adult will remain. However, the Adult will no longer be able to control the Young Adult’s use of Zelle®. If no limits have been set by the Adult, Zelle® transactions will then be subject to limits on the amount and frequency of transfers to and from your account. These limits are designed to be flexible in order to protect the security and integrity of the service and accounts, including protecting you and all other users of the service. These limitations may be based on confidential fraud and risk criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of you and the integrity of the service and may be modified at our sole discretion without advance notice. See \"Sending Money Using Zelle®\" for more details.\nMONEY debit card -\nMONEY is designed specifically for young adults, so the card cannot be used with businesses that primarily provide services that may not be appropriate for young adults.\nFor the account owner who is less than 18 years old:\nTotal card purchases and withdrawals are limited to $500 per day. This includes ATM withdrawals, cash advances, and signature and PIN-based purchases. Withdrawals from an ATM made using a MONEY Card are limited to $500 per day. You can lower this limit by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nFor account owners who are at least 18 years old:\nTotal card purchases and withdrawals are limited to $5,000 per day. This includes ATM withdrawals, cash advances, and signature and PIN-based purchases. Daily limits on withdrawals from an ATM made using your account’s ATM/debit card are set based on confidential fraud and risk criteria that are essential to your protection and the integrity of the service and may be modified at our sole discretion without advance notice. You can check your daily withdrawal limit on the Capital One Mobile App or by calling us at 1-800-655-2265. You can also lower your limit by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nMONEY agreement\nThe basics: MONEY is an electronic transactional account that pays a variable rate of interest and allows you to make withdrawals by using a debit card or by transferring funds to any other Capital One account you have (except existing Certificates of Deposit) or your Linked Account. You need to read this agreement and hold on to it in case you have any questions down the road. Please understand that by applying for or using MONEY, you're doing 2 things. First, you're agreeing to be bound by the terms of this agreement, in addition to any other agreements you have entered into with us. Second, you're asking us to automatically issue a MONEY Debit Card (the \"Card\") to the Young Adult. The Adult will not get a Card.\nMONEY mobile service overview\nBy use of your MONEY account, we are providing features through the Capital One mobile app, which may change from time to time, to help the Adult use the Account to help the Young Adult learn and practice money management.\nAdults have features to send ad-hoc (one-time) transfers, set an allowance (recurring transfer), lock or unlock the Young Adult’s card, set ATM and spending limits, and control the Young Adult’s access to use Zelle® to send money to friends and family.\nYoung Adults can distribute their balance between “Spendable” (amounts allocated towards spending) and “Set Aside” (amounts allocated towards saving), and set up a savings goal. Such features can provide an easy way for the Young Adult to see the interaction between spending and saving. Please note that while the Young Adult can designate part of their balance as “Set Aside” for the purpose of trying to save money, the money remains in the account and does not have a separate interest rate. In addition, if any transaction exceeds the Young Adult’s Spendable allocation, the Set Aside allocation will be used.\nThe Young Adult can also lock/unlock, reorder, and change PIN for their debit card. Young adults are prevented from taking this action if the adult has locked the card.\nIn-app feedback\nUsers can submit suggestions via the MONEY account mobile experience. This feedback helps us improve the user experience. This form is intended for users aged 13 and older, but the Adult can submit feedback on behalf of the Young Adult. Do not include non-public information such as account number or social security number. Please note, we cannot respond directly to feedback submitted through this form. For complaints, transaction disputes, and other issues, please call Capital One at 1-800-655-2265.\nAs an 18 year old, the Young Adult will be able to explore, apply for, and open other Capital One products on their own, and they may be made aware of this ability in the app or Capital One unless they have opted out of such offerings. See the Bank’s Privacy Policy here.\nTech support\nWe may or may not provide you with technical and other support for the Service. You agree to abide by any support rules and policies that we establish in order to receive such support. If such support is provided, it will be provided in addition to your normal support for your Capital One Accounts.\nTermination of use; discontinuation; and modification of the service\nIf you violate any provision of these Terms, your permission to use the Service will terminate automatically. Additionally, we, in our sole discretion, may terminate your MONEY Account on the Service or suspend or terminate access to any part or all of the Service at any time, with or without notice.

The Capital One Online Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of these Terms.\nAdditional Terms. Your use of the Service is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Service or certain features of the Service that we may post on or link to on the Service (the \"Additional Terms\"), such as end-user license agreements for any downloadable applications that we may offer, or rules applicable to particular features or content on the Service or additional services. All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of these Terms.\nChanges to the terms\nWe reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time.

All other changes are effective upon publication of the changed Terms. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.\nOwnership; proprietary rights; feedback\nThe visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service (the “Materials”) provided by us are protected by all relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights and applicable laws. All Materials contained in the Service are the property of us or our third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by us you may not make use of the Materials. We reserve all rights to the Materials not granted expressly in these Terms.\nYou may provide us with, or we may solicit your feedback, ideas, or suggestions with respect to the Services, and you hereby grant us a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, sublicensable, full-paid up, irrevocable, royalty free license to use such feedback in future modifications of the Service, other products or services, or marketing or materials. We will not, however, disclose such feedback in a way that would identify you, without obtaining your permission.\nIndemnity\nYou agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Capital One, N.A. and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (collectively, the \"Capital One Entities\") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Service; (ii) your violation of these Terms or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.\nGeneral\nThese Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and us, regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration.\nAdditional terms We can add eligibility requirements to use the Service at any time.\nYou will follow all laws, regulations, and terms related to the Service.\nThe Service can be affected by the terms of other agreements you have with other parties including those for your mobile telephone and any mobile service. We have no responsibility or obligations under any of these agreements, and the Terms will not change any of your rights and obligations under them.\nYour promises to us – including your indemnification of us – will continue even after the Terms ends.\nAll of our affiliated entities and parties you indemnify under the Terms will be third party beneficiaries of the Terms and entitled to directly rely on its provisions and enforce it. No other person or party will have rights or claims under the Terms.\nIf any provision of the Terms is found to not be enforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain valid and enforceable. You and we will work in good faith to substitute other enforceable terms that are similar to those that are unenforceable. Our failure to enforce any term(s) of the Terms will not be a waiver or affect our right to later enforce them.\nEligible customers: MONEY is available to United States citizens or lawful permanent residents with a U.S. physical address located in one of the 50 United States or Washington, D.C., or with military addresses (APO or FPO). Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) are acceptable for account opening in Branches and Capital One Cafés and your Linked Account must be with a bank chartered in the U.S. MONEY must have two owners, the \"Adult\" who must be at least 18 years old and the \"Young Adult\". The “Adult” must be the parent or legal guardian of the “Young Adult”. We may restrict the Young Adult's access to some features of MONEY. The Adult on the account must have either (i) an existing, active deposit account with Capital One that's in good standing; or (ii) a personal (non-business) checking account at another U.S. chartered bank that can and will be linked to your MONEY (the \"Linked Account\").\nYou must also be a paperless Customer - that means that (i) you must keep us supplied with your valid email address; and (ii) you must agree to accept electronic delivery of all communications (like end-of-year tax forms and electronic statements) that we need or decide to send you.\nAccount opening: You can only open MONEY on our interactive website. If you already have an account with us when you open MONEY, your existing Linked Account(s) will also be linked to your MONEY. We reserve the right to verify that you are the owner of the Linked Account. Your MONEY account won’t be considered “opened” until it’s funded. This means your balance must be at least a penny.\nObtaining credit reports: We may request a consumer (credit) report in connection with your account(s). Upon your request, you will be informed whether or not a consumer (credit) report was requested, and if such report was requested, informed of the name and address of the consumer (credit) reporting agency that furnished the report. We may also request subsequent consumer (credit) reports for all legitimate purposes in connection with updating, renewing, reviewing, modifying, and/or taking collection action on your account(s).\nReporting information to consumer reporting agencies and check verifications systems: We may report information about your account to consumer reporting agencies and/or check verification systems for the Adult on the account. Defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. This could affect your ability to open accounts in the future. In the event we report your account to a check verification system, you acknowledge that even if you pay us all amounts owed, we are not required to remove an accurate report of account mishandling from any such check verification system.\nConsumer Account:\nYour MONEY Teen Checking account is a consumer account and must be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If you fail to comply with these conditions, or use your account for business purposes, we may restrict use of, or close your account.\nAccount ownership: MONEY is a joint account owned by 2 people called \"joint tenants\" and all deposits made into the account are owned by both people. Except for certain retirement benefits like Social Security, if one person dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). Any adult owner of MONEY may, as allowed in this agreement: 1) withdraw, transfer funds or close the account without the other owner's consent; 2) pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us; or 3) deposit checks payable to any joint owner.\nIf one joint owner requests that we not pay items authorized by a different joint owner, we may restrict the account and refuse to pay all items (including items authorized by the owner making the request), but we are not required to do so. If we restrict the account, we may not release the restriction unless all joint owners agree in writing to remove it. No request to restrict the account will affect items that we paid before the request. If we decide not to restrict the account, all joint owners remain responsible for items subtracted from the account.\nJoint account with minor. This type of account is owned by one minor (under age 18) and one adult, and the owners of the account are called \"joint tenants.\" If the minor is 12 years of age or younger, then a parent or legal guardian must be a joint owner. Except for certain benefits like Social Security, if one account holder dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). Any owner of the account may transfer funds without the other owner's consent, but only the Adult account holder may withdraw funds to another bank. When the minor reaches 18 years old, certain changes will occur as disclosed throughout these terms, including the ability to send money using Zelle®. See \"Sending Money Using Zelle®\" for additional details.\n“Payable on Death” (POD): You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. Only an individual may be designated as a beneficiary. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nWe may also pay all or any part of the funds in the account to a court or government agency if we receive a garnishment, levy or similar legal process that identifies any of the joint owners.\nConnecting accounts: If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will automatically \"connect\" your eligible accounts so they appear when you're logged into your account through the website or mobile app.\nWe will display only summary information about your \"connected\" accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts and people with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nDeposits: This account allows you to make deposits by cash, check, Automated Clearing House (ACH), domestic wire transfer or other payment network transfers, or transfer from another eligible Capital One, N.A. deposit account.\nAny transaction that you conduct on Saturday, Sunday, a federal holiday, or other days on which we are closed may be handled the following business day.\nChecks you deposit must be payable to you or to the living trust (in the case of a trust account).\nWe may refuse all or part of a deposit. We also may refuse a deposit after initially accepting it. If we do that, we will reverse the amount added to your account and send it to you via check or your external linked account. We will not be liable to you for refusing a deposit, even if it causes us to decline any transactions you have already made.\nIf a check from a split deposit is returned unpaid, we’ll deduct the full amount of the check from the account that received the largest portion of the check. If the deposit was split for an equal amount, we’ll deduct the full amount of the check from the first account in the transaction sequence.\nOnce your account is open, funds will be available according to the Deposit Availability Disclosure section of this agreement.\nIf a check or other deposit is returned to us unpaid or is otherwise charged back to us, we will deduct the amount of the check/deposit from your account. If the check was deposited into MONEY and multiple other Capital One accounts, we will debit your MONEY account for the full amount.\nForeign checks are handled as collection items only and are converted at our current daily rate and credited in U.S. dollars. Foreign checks sent for collection are exchanged at the exchange rate on the day of payment. All returned foreign checks will be charged back to your account at the rate used when initially credited and may be subject to a foreign bank charge (if applicable). Please note that while the foreign check collection process typically takes anywhere from four to six weeks, we have no control over the process once a check is sent for foreign collection. Accordingly, the process may take longer, depending on the foreign bank. You hereby waive notice of dishonor, nonpayment, or protest with respect to any items credited to or charged against your account.\nIt's also simple to make withdrawals: You can request a withdrawal from your account by using our website, calling us, or visiting one of our branches.\nWithdrawals and transfers: Generally, you can withdraw or transfer money from your MONEY account by 1) using our website or mobile app; 2); using the Card we give to the Young Adult to make withdrawals at ATMs and points of sale (\"POS\"); 3) visiting one of our branch locations; or 4) calling us. We may limit, refuse or return any withdrawal or transfer of funds from your MONEY account that is made in a manner not permitted by us. You can't use checks to make a withdrawal from your MONEY account or transfer money to or from your MONEY account at a Capital One ATM terminal.\nFree transfers to or from your own linked account at another financial institution are processed via the automated clearing house (ACH) network, and will typically take 3-4 business days to transfer.

That's great because the Card can be used to (i) withdraw money at automated teller machines (\"ATMs\") that are part of a network we participate in; (ii) deposit cash or checks at a Capital One ATM that accepts Capital One deposits, and (iii) make POS purchases (including \"cash-back\" transactions where a merchant gives you cash from your MONEY account). You can't use your Card at an ATM to transfer money between your Capital One accounts or Linked Accounts. By using your Card, you authorize us and/or our agents to debit your MONEY account. You're responsible for all transactions you authorize using the Card, including any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result. Other than cross-border transactions, we don't charge you for using your Card. But, if you use your Card at an ATM, the owner of the ATM may charge you for using the ATM. If there is such a charge, you should be told how much it is before you complete the withdrawal. If you then decide to withdraw the money, the amount of the withdrawal, plus the charge, will be deducted from your MONEY account. The Card is the property of Capital One and if your MONEY account is closed or your Card privileges are canceled, you agree to stop using the Card and destroy it.\nTransactions made with your Card in foreign currencies and transactions that are classified by MasterCard® as \"cross-border transactions\" (generally, transactions that are processed outside the United States) are called \"foreign transactions.\" If a foreign transaction is in a foreign currency, it will be posted to your account in U.S. Dollars. The exchange rate between the foreign currency and U.S. Dollars is a rate selected by MasterCard®. Basically, here's how MasterCard® calculates the exchange rate: they usually start with either a government-mandated currency rate or a wholesale rate as of the day your foreign transaction is processed (i.e., not the date you made your purchase and not the date your purchase is posted on your statement).\nSending Money Using Zelle®\nThe Zelle® feature on the MONEY account is available for Young Adults 13 and older within the mobile experience. Customers ages 13 to 17 will need an adult’s consent to access Zelle®. The feature will not show in the mobile experience if the Young Adult is not yet eligible and will not be available for any Young Adult until the Adult has consented on their behalf.\nWhile the Young Adult is a minor under 18, the Adult is responsible for any transactions the Young Adult conducts using Zelle®. Payments that have not yet been processed via Zelle® may be canceled. Once a payment is sent, it cannot be canceled or reversed. Once permission to use Zelle® has been granted by the Adult, the Young Adult (once registered) can send money using Zelle®. Parents can grant or revoke Zelle® access for their Young Adult under 18 years old from the Parental Controls within the Capital One mobile app. If the Zelle® service is revoked, and the Young Adult is unenrolled from Zelle®, any pending transfers will be canceled. If access is once again granted to the Young Adult, they will be required to re-enroll with Zelle® to use this feature.\nZelle® usage details\nAdult’s rights when using Zelle®: \nCan grant the Young Adult permission to use Zelle® and is responsible for any transactions the Young Adult conducts using Zelle®.\nMust consent to Zelle® Terms & Conditions on behalf of the Young Adult.\nCan revoke permission to use Zelle® by unenrolling the Young Adult from the Zelle® network.\nCan lower the $500 per day limit for money sent using Zelle®.\nCan see the current Zelle® enrollment status and limits via the Adult mobile experience.\nYoung Adult’s rights when using Zelle®: \nMust be 13 or older\nCannot access or use Zelle® without Adult's permission.\nIf there are updates to the terms of the Zelle® service, the Young Adult will not be able to use the feature until the Adult re-consents to the updated terms.\nThe Young Adult can enroll and manage their contact points with Zelle®\nCan send up to $500 per day via Zelle® unless this limit is lowered by the Adult.\nCannot use the feature if the Adult revokes permission.\nWhat Changes When the Young Adult Reaches Age 18 \nBy continuing to use Zelle®, the Young Adult consents to the Zelle® terms and conditions\nIf the Young Adult is not already a registered user of Zelle® prior to reaching 18, the Young Adult will need to consent to Zelle® terms and conditions in order to enroll and use Zelle®\nWhen turning 18, Zelle® limits set by the Adult will remain; however, the Adult will no longer be able to toggle off the Young Adult’s access to Zelle®.\nAll owners on the account are responsible for authorized transactions conducted using Zelle®.\nFor your protection and our protection: You authorize us to follow any instructions you give to us. We reserve the right to contact you to obtain confirmation of any instruction before processing it. However, we're not required to confirm any instruction that looks like it was made by you, and we won't be liable if we don't contact you. We're also not required to confirm the actual identity or authority of anyone who uses your Password or a personal identification number (\"PIN\") or any account access device we gave you (like the Card) (collectively, \"E-Identification\"). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion and without notice, to refuse to make a withdrawal or transfer for security, credit, legal/regulatory or other reasons, and to refuse to honor withdrawal or transfer requests that appear to be fraudulent or erroneous. We can limit, refuse or return any withdrawal or transfer of funds from your account that is made in a way not permitted by us.\nStatements: As required by law, we‘ll provide you with a statement at least 4 times a year. Your Statement will be made available to you based on your selected delivery method. Payments or transfers you make will be listed on your Statement. You agree to notify us within 60 days if you think there‘s an error or unauthorized transaction shown on your Statement.\nOverdrafts: If your Available Balance isn't enough to cover any withdrawal or transfer you've authorized, you agree that we can refuse to process the withdrawal/transfer. If for some reason we allow your MONEY to be overdrawn, you must immediately make a deposit to cover the excess overdraft. If you don't promptly make a deposit to cover the overdraft, you agree that we can transfer funds from any other deposit account you have with us to cover the overdraft. If we sue you to collect any overdraft, you agree that we're entitled to collect all costs and expenses of suit from you (including the reasonable cost of an attorney), in accordance with applicable law. You agree that we aren't liable for any damages or expenses you incur due to any delay or failure of any Payee or third party in crediting or processing a withdrawal or transfer.\nWhat gets processed when: “Send Money With Zelle®”, the funds will be removed as soon as the payment is confirmed as successful. At midnight of each bank business day, we'll first process electronic fund transfers scheduled for that bank business day. If there aren't enough funds in your MONEY to allow all of the scheduled transactions for a bank business day to be completed, we'll process your scheduled electronic fund transfers from highest dollar amount to lowest dollar amount. We'll attempt every scheduled payment until your Available Balance is insufficient to cover a transfer.\nYour responsibility: You're responsible for all transactions you authorize, including any transactions you unintentionally or inadvertently authorize, and any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result. You must follow all of our instructions when you request and authorize any MONEY features. You must have sufficient available funds in your MONEY account to cover any withdrawal or transfer you request. If you authorize someone else to use your MONEY account or Card, you're responsible for everything that person does with your account, including any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result.\nYou’re also responsible for giving us accurate Payee information. If any Payee information changes after you initiate a transfer or payment, you’re responsible for notifying us of these changes. If you tell us to make a payment to a particular Payee and you fail to give us the correct information, we’re not responsible or liable for the payment.\nYou agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the bank and any of our third party providers who perform money related services for you on our behalf from any and all claims and liability arising from any payments initiated by you that aren’t completed due to lack of funds in your account(s).\nUnder no circumstances will we or our third party providers be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of your use of the money features, regardless of the nature of the claim, including negligence, even if we or our third-party providers know that such damages may occur. Money features are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\nOur responsibility: If we don't complete a payment or transfer on time, according to your properly transmitted instructions, we may be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, we won't be liable for losses and damages if:\nyou don't have enough available funds in your MONEY account to complete a withdrawal or transfer, if your checking has been closed, frozen, or isn't in good standing, or if we reverse a payment or transfer because of insufficient funds;\nyou haven't properly followed our instructions;\nPayee or account information you give us is incorrect;\nyou don’t authorize a payment or transfer soon enough for it to reach the Payee by its due date;\nyou receive notice from a Payee that any payment or transfer you made remains unpaid or hasn’t been completed, and you don’t notify us promptly;\nwithdrawals from any of your accounts have been prohibited by a Court Order or other legal process;\nyour computer, software, any Internet service provider, or our interactive website or mobile app wasn't working properly and this problem should have been apparent to you when you tried to authorize a transfer or payment;\nyou, or anyone you allow to use your MONEY account, commits fraud or violates any law or regulation; or\ncircumstances beyond our control prevent a withdrawal or transfer from being made.\nYour MONEY Agreement and other agreements you may have with us contain other exceptions to the Bank’s liability. You agree that we don’t have any responsibility or liability for any act or omission beyond that which is imposed on us by law.\nCollection of items: If we elect to receive checks and other items for collection, we act as your collection agent and don't assume any responsibility beyond the exercise of due care. We won't be liable for any default or negligence by any other banks we use to collect the check or item or for any loss in transit.\nThings you tell us to do: We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes: You must notify us of any change of address by calling us, or using our secure website. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you've told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (\"USPS\") or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.\nCommunication: You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us), and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nWhile we may be able to provide some customer assistance in languages other than English, we cannot guarantee that customer service will always be available in languages other than English. As a courtesy, we may translate some of our forms, letters and disclosures, including this agreement, into another language. However, many important bank documents, and some products and services related to this account, are provided only in English.\nMonitoring and closing your account: We reserve the right to monitor all MONEY activity for inappropriate use. Either you or we may close your MONEY at any time and for any reason. If we disable your MONEY with or without advance notice, all collected funds (less any amounts due to us) will be transferred to your external Linked Account, mailed as a check to the address we have in our records, or credited to another account you have with us.\nState laws (called \"escheat\" or unclaimed property laws) require us to close all your deposit accounts and transfer your money to the state if your accounts are dormant for a period of time, as defined by your state of residence. Your account can become dormant if, for 24 months, there is no transactional activity. Your account will remain dormant until funds are transferred to or from the dormant account. If all of your accounts become dormant, you may no longer receive paper statements, but you can still view your accounts online.\nState abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable state. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products are subject to abandoned property laws, including IRAs and CDs. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. We want you to keep your money, not the state! You can avoid the transfer of your money to the state simply by signing into your account, transacting periodically, contacting us, or replying to any abandoned property correspondence.\nThe Add Cash In Store Service\nAdd Cash In Store (“ACIS”) allows you to initiate through your agent, InComm Financial Services, Inc. (\"InComm\") and its agents, a transfer of funds to your ACCOUNT using the VANILLADIRECT service provided by InComm. There is no additional charge to you for using ACIS, but message and data rates could apply from your mobile service provider.\nWhen you use ACIS, you are asking InComm to transfer your funds to us on your behalf as your money transmitter agent as instructed by you. Following the TRANSMISSION from InComm to us, we will then credit the funds to your ACCOUNT.\nYou agree that we can share information about you, including information you provide to us when you use ACIS, with InComm and RETAILERS for purposes of performing the ACIS, as well as for resolving any errors, disputes or other processing issues. In addition, you are asking us to provide InComm with any updates to the information that you may later provide to us for InComm's use in accordance with InComm's privacy policy.\nInComm and the RETAILERS are not affiliated with us and are not agents or branches of Capital One, N.A. We do not provide, endorse or guarantee any third-party service, information or recommendation, including any information or recommendation offered by InComm or the RETAILERS.

You agree to the terms of this AGREEMENT when you enroll and each time you use the ACIS. Not all ACCOUNTS are eligible for the ACIS.\nThe meanings of capitalized terms appear in the Glossary Section at the end of this AGREEMENT. To make the AGREEMENT easier to understand, we also use the following personal pronouns:\n\"You\" and \"your\" means the person or persons that use the ACIS and any joint or other authorized ACCOUNT holder or authorized party on the ACCOUNT and their successors and assignees. All persons that are ACCOUNT holders or authorized parties on the ACCOUNT are responsible for authorized transactions conducted using the ACIS.\n\"We,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" means Capital One, N.A. and its agents, processors, affiliates, representatives, successors, and assignees.\nLimitations of the Service\nThe ACIS can only be used for TRANSMISSIONS to us. Also, you can only have one TRANSMISSION pending at a time. After that TRANSMISSION is either completed with InComm or expires as described below, you can then prepare another TRANSMISSION.\nAll Account holders on eligible Accounts will have access to Add Cash In Store. The Account is subject to transaction, daily, and monthly limits on the dollar amount of transfers using this feature. We can modify these limits at any time at our option. We do not disclose certain limits if we believe the confidentiality of the limits is essential to maintain the security of your ACCOUNT or the ACIS. All Account holders will be made aware of the limits when they engage with the ACIS to Add Cash In Store.\nRETAILER participation for this ACIS will be limited. The ACIS has a map listing the participating RETAILERS and their locations. Please check availability and locations prior to preparing a fund transfer.

You will need to visit the RETAILER and perform your prepared fund transfer before the barcode expires. Upon the expiration of the barcode, your prepared fund transfer will expire and the RETAILER will not be able to complete it. (If this happens, you will have to prepare a new fund transfer).\nThe RETAILER will scan the barcode and will, in its sole discretion, accept or reject the cash from you. The RETAILER may require certain types of documentation to verify your identity when you use the ACIS, depending on the transaction amount. The amount that could prompt a RETAILER to request documentation to verify your identity may be confidential for security purposes. Please note that Capital One will not record or maintain an image of such documentation when you use the ACIS.\nThe RETAILER will give you a receipt that matches the Transmission that you set up on the ADD CASH IN STORE WIDGET and matches the amount of cash that you gave to the RETAILER.\nAlways make sure to get a receipt from the RETAILER that matches the Transmission you just made in case there is a problem.\nAvailability of Fund Transfers using the Service\nFund transfers made using the ACIS will be credited to your ACCOUNT as soon as we receive the TRANSMISSION from InComm. Once credited, these funds will be available immediately for withdrawal, including through ATM withdrawals or payments through checks.\nError Resolution or Disputes\nIn the event that you or we discover a processing or TRANSMISSION error, we will help rectify the error regardless of whether it favored you or us.

We will then attempt to process and collect these deposited Images for payment.\nYour agreement with us\nThis Agreement contains the terms for our RDCS. You agree to the terms of this Agreement when you enroll and each time you use the RDCS. Not all Accounts are eligible for the RDCS.\nThe meanings of the terms you see in italics appear in the Glossary section at the end of this Agreement. To make the Agreement easier to understand, we also use the following personal pronouns:\n\"You\" and \"your\" means the person, persons or Business that use or receive the RDCS and any joint or other authorized Account holder or authorized party on the Account and their successors and assignees.\n\"We,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" means Capital One, N.A. and its agents, processors, affiliates, representatives, successors, and assignees.\nThe terms of this Agreement are in addition to the other agreements, terms, conditions, disclosures, software and fee schedules you have from us related to your Account including those for our mobile banking and online banking services. If there is a disagreement between the terms in this Agreement and those in other agreements related to the RDCS, this Agreement will control.\nBusiness customers\nEach Business that we allow to use the RDCS must be organized, licensed and authorized to do business in the U.S. as the law requires. Each Business permitted to use the RDCS will only allow Business Representatives to use the RDCS in connection with any Account owned by the Business.\nImage transmission, processing and payment\nAll Images you Transmit to us using the RDCS must be legible and meet our Program requirements including hardware and software requirements such as required Mobile Devices, operating systems and camera specifications. All required hardware and software will be at your expense.\nThe information you Transmit to us must meet the requirements to create a Substitute Check (including all MICR-line information) and contain the correct amount of the Eligible Item. Also, each Image must meet the technical requirements of an “electronic item” under Regulation J and Federal Reserve Operating Circulars. Additional requirements will be included in the Program.\nWhen you Transmit an Image to us, you agree that the Image is an “item” as defined by the UCC and is the legal equivalent of the Eligible Item for all purposes including our qualifying as a holder-in-due-course for it as described by the UCC.\nWe can attempt to process, collect, present for payment, return or re-present your Images in any way we choose that is allowed. This includes as Images under private agreement or clearinghouse rules, as automated clearinghouse entries (ACH) under the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA) rules, through a Federal Reserve payment service under Regulation J and Federal Reserve Operating Circulars, or as Substitute Checks.\nWe can reject any Image for any reason at our option and without liability, even where we have provided you with a confirmation notice. If your image is rejected, it will not appear in your Upcoming or Past/Recent Transactions. You will need to try again and redeposit the image. Do not destroy your check until you see the full deposit amount posted in your Recent Transactions.\nIf an Image does not meet our Program processing requirements, we can also at our option: (1) process the Image as received for payment; (2) correct the Image or its accompanying data and process the corrected Image for payment; (3) process the deposit for payment in another format as allowed; or (4) debit (chargeback) your Account for the amount of the Image. If you request a copy of the charged back image, we can return it to you in any way we choose including as an image along with its accompanying data or as a Substitute Check.\nWhen you successfully Transmit an Image to us, it will appear in your Upcoming/Recent Transactions. This does not mean that your Transmission and deposit are complete. All of your Images are subject to our further verification prior to being accepted for deposit and final payment after deposit.

We do not need to tell you if we believe a transaction limit is necessary to maintain or restore the security of an Account, the RDCS or the Program.\nYour handling of the original eligible item\nWhen you Transmit an Image to us, you will still have possession of the original Eligible Item. In order to further prevent an additional submission of the original Eligible Item for payment, you will take the following steps: (1) before you Transmit an Image to us, you will endorse (write your signature or Business name and signature if you are a Business) on the back of the original Eligible Item followed by the words “for Capital One mobile deposit” or as we otherwise tell you; (2) you will keep the original Eligible Item in a safe place until you see in it your Past/Recent Transactions; and (3) after you see the deposit in your account’s Past/Recent Transactions, you will destroy the original Eligible Item by shredding it or cutting it up.\nAvailability of your deposits using the services\nEligible Items deposited using the RDCS are not subject to the funds availability requirements of Regulation CC or our Availability Schedule. This will be true even if we provide you with Regulation CC disclosures or notices. For deposits made using the RDCS, we will still generally follow the Availability Schedule for the Account.\nAfter you Transmit an Image to us, we can place an extended hold on your deposited funds as described in our Availability Schedule. If we do, we will contact you to let you know when you can expect your funds to be available for withdrawal. You agree that we can include deposits made using the RDCS in deciding to place large deposit extended holds as described in our Availability Schedule.\nCutoff times for deposits using the service\nIf you successfully Transmit an Image to us before the cutoff time of 9 PM EST for the Account on a Business Day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. After that time or on a day we are not open, we will consider the deposit to be made on the next Business Day that we are open.\nNotices\nIn addition to notices we send to your Mobile Device, we may also send you notices about the RDCS in other ways the law allows including by automated (autodialed) text message, e-mail, regular mail, or website postings.

This is true even if you have made withdrawals against it. We can also charge fees connected to the chargeback as described in your fee schedule and other agreements with us.\nSecurity\nYou are responsible for protecting your Mobile Device against unauthorized use as well as any losses and damages from unauthorized access.

  "text": "\"Send Money with Zelle\" feature\nYou can use your account’s \"Send Money with Zelle\" feature to authorize a person-to-person payment to other people (like your friends, babysitter, or neighbor), including folks who have accounts at Capital One. The transfer limitations are described in the \"Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosure Statement\" section of this disclosure. You cannot use your Overdraft Line of Credit for \"Send Money with Zelle\" transactions.\nCheckbooks\nOur \"Checkbooks\" Feature allows you to order a checkbook so you can write physical checks. Each customer's first 50 quantity checkbook is free. Fees vary on subsequent orders including checkbooks for additional accounts. We may change the amount of the charge at any time. Also, if you write a check in an amount that exceeds your Available Balance plus any available Overdraft Protection amount at the time the check is presented to us for payment, we‘ll return the check. Customers cannot receive checkbooks at U.S. Territory or International addresses.\nSend an outgoing domestic wire feature\nWe may offer a \"Send an Outgoing Domestic Wire\" feature and allow you to make a wire transfer from your account. We will charge you a fee for using this feature, and the charge will be deducted from the checking account you use for the wire at the same time we deduct the amount of the wire. We may also limit the amount you can send and where we will allow you to send the wire.\nOverdrafts – An overdraft is when withdrawals are made against your account for an amount in excess of your available balance. Please see the Overdraft Services section of this agreement for additional information about overdrafts and our programs.\nIf your available balance isn't enough to cover any payment or withdrawal you've authorized (including any applicable charges), you agree that we can either overdraw your checking account, allow an advance from your Overdraft Line of Credit (360 Checking only), initiate a transfer from your linked Free Savings Transfer account, or we can refuse to process the payment/withdrawal. If for some reason we allow your checking account to be overdrawn, you must immediately make a deposit to cover the negative balance. This can happen if a transaction takes your checking balance negative or (if applicable) a transaction exceeds your available overdraft protection amount.\nIf we sue you to collect any overdraft, you agree that we're entitled to collect all costs and expenses of suit from you (including the reasonable cost of an attorney), in accordance with applicable law. You agree that we aren't liable for any damages or expenses you incur due to any delay or failure of the (i) courier (or the U.S. Postal Service) in delivering any check; and (ii) any Payee or third party in crediting or processing a payment or withdrawal.\nStopping/changing/cancelling payments – You may not stop, change, or cancel a cashier’s check after your request for a cashier’s check has been submitted to us. After a cashier’s check has been issued, you may not stop, change, or cancel it unless it has been lost, undelivered, destroyed, or was unauthorized. In this instance, you must notify Capital One immediately and, after presenting an Affidavit, the funds will be replenished on day 95 after the cashier’s check was ordered. If you return a cashier’s check to Capital One, it will be replenished upon receipt.\nFor stop payment requests made on checks written from your checkbook, we can’t guarantee that the check won’t be paid (for example, if the check is cashed before we’ve had an opportunity to act on your stop payment request).\nRefer to the Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosure Statement for information regarding electronic fund transfer stop payment requests.\nCancellation or amendment of funds transfer for outgoing wires\nOnce we receive a Funds Transfer Request, it may not be able to be canceled or amended. However, at our discretion, we may use reasonable efforts to act on any request for cancellation or amendment, provided that the method by which we are notified of a request for cancellation or amendment complies with our security procedures. However, we shall have no liability if such cancellation or amendment is not effected. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses we may incur in attempting to cancel or amend the Funds Transfer. Any cancellation or amendment of a Funds Transfer by us shall relieve us of any obligation to act on the original Funds Transfer Request.\n360 Checking card and multiple accounts – When you open your first 360 Checking account, we will automatically issue you a debit card. We will not issue additional debit cards for the additional 360 Checking accounts you open. If you open additional 360 Checking accounts, your debit card will still be attached to the account that it was attached to. If you would like, you can change your default spending account online or over the phone. The 360 Checking account that you choose as your default account will be the account for all ATM withdrawals and deposits as well as point of sale (POS) transactions.\nWhat gets processed when – \"Outgoing Domestic Wires,\" \"Send Money with Zelle\" transactions, and cashier's check will be processed as soon as possible after you enter them (and the funds will be removed from your account immediately). At midnight of each business day, we‘ll first process electronic fund transfers (other than \"Bill Pay\" instructions) scheduled for that business day. After all of those instructions have been processed, we‘ll then process all \"Bill Pay\" instructions scheduled for that business day.\nIf there aren‘t enough funds in your 360 Checking account to allow all of the scheduled transactions for a business day to be completed ... we‘ll process your scheduled electronic fund transfers (other than \"Bill Pay\" instructions) for that day first. We‘ll then process all scheduled \"Bill Pay\" instructions for that day from highest dollar amount to lowest dollar amount. We‘ll attempt every scheduled payment until we exhaust your available balance (including your Overdraft Line of Credit/Free Savings Transfer account). For example, if you schedule three Bill Pay transfers of $1,000, $500 and $250 for the same business day, but only have $1,250 available (including your Overdraft Line of Credit/ Free Savings Transfer account), we‘ll first pay the $1,000 transfer. Next, we‘ll attempt the $500 transfer. You won‘t have enough funds, so we‘ll refuse it. Finally, we‘ll attempt the $250 transfer. You do have funds to cover this payment, so we‘ll process it.\nYour responsibility – You're responsible for all transactions you authorize, including any transactions or payments you unintentionally or inadvertently authorize, and any losses, charges, or penalties incurred as a result. You must follow all of our instructions when you request and authorize any account features. You must have sufficient available funds in your account (which may include any available credit from one of our overdraft services that you have previously enrolled in) to cover any payment or transfer you request. If you authorize someone else to use your account or card, you're responsible for everything that person does with your account, including any losses, charges or penalties incurred as a result.\nYou're also responsible for giving us accurate Payee information. If any Payee information changes after you initiate a transfer or payment, you're responsible for notifying us of these changes. If you tell us to make a payment to a particular Payee and you fail to give us the correct information, we're not responsible or liable for the payment.\nYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the bank and any of our third party providers who perform account related services for you on our behalf from any and all claims and liability arising from (i) your use or inability to use bill pay; and (ii) any payments initiated by you that aren't completed due to lack of funds in your account(s).\nUnder no circumstances will we or our third party providers be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of your use of the account features, regardless of the nature of the claim, including negligence, even if we or our third party providers know that such damages may occur. Bill Pay and other account features are provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\nOur responsibility – If we don't complete a payment or transfer on time, according to your properly transmitted instructions, we may be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, we won't be liable for losses and damages if:\nyou don't have enough available funds in your 360 Checking account (including any available amounts from one of our overdraft services that you have previously enrolled in) to complete a payment or transfer, if your checking account has been closed, frozen, or isn't in good standing, or if we reverse a payment or transfer because of insufficient funds;\nyou haven't properly followed our instructions;\nPayee or account information you give us is incorrect;\nyou don't authorize a payment or transfer soon enough for it to reach the Payee by its due date;\nyou receive notice from a Payee that any payment or transfer you made remains unpaid or hasn't been completed, and you don't notify us promptly;\nwithdrawals from any of your accounts have been prohibited by a court order or other legal process;\nyour computer, software, any Internet service provider, or our interactive website or mobile app wasn't working properly and this problem should have been apparent to you when you tried to authorize a transfer or payment;\nyou, or anyone you allow to use your 360 Checking account, commits fraud or violates any law or regulation;\ncircumstances beyond our control prevent a transfer or payment from being made.\nYour 360 Checking Agreement, Overdraft Line of Credit Agreement and other agreements you may have with us contain other exceptions to the Bank's liability. You agree that we don‘t have any responsibility or liability for any act or omission beyond that which is imposed on us by law.\nCollection of items – If we elect to receive checks and other items for collection, we act as your collection agent and don‘t assume any responsibility beyond the exercise of due care. We won‘t be liable for any default or negligence by any other banks we use to collect the check or item or for any loss in transit.\nThings you tell us to do – We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes – You must notify us of any change of address by calling us or using our secure website. Any notice we mail to you (or email to you if you‘ve told us to communicate with you electronically) will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service (\"USPS\") or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address. Even if you elected to receive electronic communications from us, there may still be some legal information that we need to send you via the USPS.\nCommunication – You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us) and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nWhile we may be able to provide some customer assistance in languages other than English, we cannot guarantee that customer service will always be available in languages other than English. As a courtesy, we may translate some of our forms, letters and disclosures, including this agreement, into another language. However, many important bank documents, and some products and services related to this account, are provided only in English.\nMonitoring and closing your account – We reserve the right to monitor all 360 Checking and Overdraft Line of Credit activity for inappropriate use. We may close your 360 Checking at any time and for any reason. If we close your account, all collected funds (less any amounts due to us) will be transferred to your external Linked Account, mailed as a check to the address we have in our records, or credited to another account you have with us.\nYou may close your account at any time provided you don't have any outstanding balance on your Overdraft Line of Credit.\nState laws (called \"escheat\" or unclaimed property laws) require us to close all your deposit accounts and transfer your money to the state if your accounts are dormant for a period of time as defined by your state of residence. Your account can become dormant if, for 24 months, there is no transactional activity. Your account will remain dormant until funds are transferred to or from the dormant account. If all of your accounts become dormant, you may no longer receive paper statements, but you can still view your accounts online.\nState abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable state. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products are subject to abandoned property laws, including IRAs and CDs. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. We want you to keep your money, not the state! You can avoid the transfer of your money to the state simply by signing into your account, transacting periodically, contacting us, or replying to any abandoned property correspondence.\nAdditional disclosures\nLien and Set-Off – We have a continuing lien on, and under the Agreement you grant us a consensual security interest in, all of your deposits as security for any and all debts or obligations you owe us as borrower or otherwise, whether due or to become due. We may at our option, at any time and without notice to you, use all or any part of the money from your account (\"set-off\") to pay any debt you owe to us or to any of our affiliates of whatever kind and however arising. This right of set-off doesn‘t apply to your accounts to the extent restricted or prohibited by law or contract.\nChange/waiver of terms – We may change the Agreement, add new provisions and/or delete provisions at any time. Changes and new provisions will be binding upon you and your account as of their effective date. If we do make a change, we‘ll let you know about it as required by law. We may change the Agreement without notice to you when necessary to conform to federal or state law.\nWe reserve the right to terminate, change, discontinue or add products, functionality, account types or features at any time and within our sole discretion. We have the right to waive any of our rights under the Agreement with respect to any transaction without obligating ourselves to treat future transactions in the same way.\nNo fiduciary obligation – Capital One doesn‘t assume any fiduciary obligation on your behalf. This means that we don‘t act as your trustee or financial advisor, and we don‘t assume any responsibility for your 360 Checking or Overdraft Line of Credit beyond reasonable care.\nAssignment - You can‘t pledge, assign, give as a gift, or otherwise transfer the ownership of all or any part of your 360 Checking or Overdraft Line of Credit to a third party without our prior written consent.\nGoverning law and regulations – Your account is subject to both federal law and the laws of the state of Virginia, as well as any operating circulars or clearing house rules that apply to us and the rules and regulations of our supervisory authorities (collectively, \"Applicable Law\"). If there's a conflict between this Agreement and Applicable Law, the Agreement will be changed to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Law. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court or administrative agency having proper jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, that determination will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.\nLevies, attachments, and other court processes – If we receive a levy, attachment, or other legal process against you or any party to your account, we may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your checking account until the legal process is dismissed or satisfied. Any levy, attachment, or other legal process will be subject to our right of set-off and security interest. You're responsible for any losses, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your account.\nClaims against your account – If we receive a claim against the funds in your account, or if we know of or believe that there's a dispute as to the ownership or control of funds in your checking account, we may, in our discretion: (i) place a hold on your account and refuse to pay out any funds until we're satisfied that the dispute is settled; (ii) close your account and send the balance to the named account holder(s); (iii) require a court order to act; or (iv) take any other action we feel is necessary to protect us. We won't be liable to you for taking any such action.\nClaim of loss – If you claim a credit or refund because of a forgery, alteration, or any other unauthorized withdrawal, you agree to cooperate with us in the investigation of the loss. Your cooperation may include, but not be limited to, providing us with an affidavit containing whatever reasonable information we require concerning your account, the transaction, and the circumstances surrounding the loss.\nDeath, incapacity or termination – If you die or are declared legally incompetent, or, in the case of a living trust account, the living trust is terminated, we can continue to accept deposits and collect items deposited to your account, as well as continue to accept transaction instructions for your account until we know of your death or adjudication of incompetency and have a reasonable opportunity to act.\nNotices to you or us – We shall deem any and all notices to us effective upon receipt by us. Any notice that we give to you will be effective when mailed or electronically transmitted to you at the mailing/email address reflected in our records. Even though we may have provided you account opening disclosures in a language other than English, we may continue to provide you with notices/communications in English. Notice to any one owner of an account constitutes notice to all owners of that account.\nCaptions – The captions used in the Agreement are for convenience only. They don‘t affect the meaning of anything in the Agreement.\nJury trial waiver – All actions arising out of this agreement or concerning your Checking Account shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury.\nEvents beyond our control – We'll make all reasonable efforts to give you access to your accounts and current and complete account information. However, you agree that we won't be responsible for any interruption in service or loss caused by an event that is beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, wars, riots, strikes, computer failure, terrorist act or loss of power, communication, or transportation facilities. We also won't be responsible for any losses or damages, including direct damages, resulting from your use of your account, unless such losses or damages are caused by our lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care. In no event will we be responsible for indirect, special, or consequential losses or damages of any kind.",

  "text": "Consumer account:\nYour Kids Savings Account is a consumer account and must be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If you fail to comply with these conditions, or use your account for business purposes, we may restrict use of, or close your account.\nTypes of account ownership:\nIndividual account. This type of account is owned by one person.\nJoint account. This type of account is owned by two people. Except for certain retirement benefits like Social Security, if one person dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person). The owners of the account are considered to be \"joint tenants\" with right of survivorship. Any owner of the account may: (i) withdraw, transfer funds or close the account without the other owner's consent; (ii) pledge the account to us as collateral for a debt owed to us; and (iii) deposit checks payable to any joint owner.\nIf one joint owner requests that we not pay items authorized by a different joint owner, we may restrict the account and refuse to pay all items (including items authorized by the owner making the request), but we are not required to do so. If we restrict the account, we may not release the restriction unless all joint owners agree in writing to remove it. No request to restrict the account will affect items that we paid before the request. If we decide not to restrict the account, all joint owners remain responsible for items subtracted from the account.\nWe may also pay all or any part of the funds in the account to a court or government agency if we receive a garnishment, levy or similar legal process that identifies any of the joint owners.\nJoint account with minor. This type of account is owned by one minor (under age 18) and one adult, and the owners of the account are called \"joint tenants.\" If the minor is 12 years of age or younger, then a parent or legal guardian must be a joint owner. Except for certain benefits like Social Security, if one account holder dies, the money in the account then belongs only to the survivor (and not to the estate of the deceased person).\nWhen the minor reaches 18 years old, both account holders will become joint account owners and will have equal privileges in terms of transfers and closing the account.\n“Payable on Death” (POD). You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. Only an individual may be designated as a beneficiary. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nConnecting accounts: If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will automatically \"connect\" your eligible accounts so they appear when you're logged into your account through the website or mobile app.\nWe will display only summary information about your \"connected\" accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts and people with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nStatements: As required by law, we‘ll provide you with a statement at least 4 times a year. Your Statement will be made available to you based on your selected delivery method. Payments or transfers you make will be listed on your Statement. You agree to notify us within 60 days if you think there‘s an error or unauthorized transaction shown on your Statement.\nThings you tell us to do: We may refuse to follow any of your instructions that in our sole judgment are illegal or would expose us to potential liability. Alternatively, we may require adequate security or invoke other security measures to protect us from all losses and expenses incurred if we follow your instructions. You agree to reimburse us for any damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we incur in connection with your account if we take an action in accordance with your or what purports to be your oral, written or electronic instructions.\nIf your address changes: You must notify us of any change of address by calling us, or using our secure website.

(This hardly ever happens but legally we have to say it!)\nAssignment: No part of an account may be pledged, assigned, given as a gift, or otherwise transferred to a third party without our prior written consent.\nHow we handle items you send us: We won't be liable for checks or other items (\"Checks\") that are lost in the mail or for any default or negligence by a bank we may use to collect your Checks. When you send us Checks to be deposited into your account, we act as your collection agent and assume no responsibility beyond the exercise of reasonable care.\nLien and Set-Off: Unless otherwise prohibited by law, by opening an account, you grant us a security interest (in other words, a \"Lien\") in your deposit accounts with us. That means that at any time and without notice to you, we can use all or any part of the money from your individual or joint accounts to pay any amounts you owe us or any of our affiliates from time to time.

  "text": "At its most basic level, a bank is a place to safely keep your money. But beyond the basics, banks usually offer a wide range of products and services designed to make managing your money a bit easier.\nFrom car loans to credit cards, there are plenty of banking services you may need at different stages of life. And with digital options, you can access many of them right from your phone or laptop. Below is a review of financial topics that may help you learn banking basics. There’s also a glossary of terms at the end.\nWhy should I put my money in a bank? \nKeeping large sums of money at home can be risky. Even though the odds may be small, there’s always the chance of loss, theft or even a natural disaster. When you deposit money in a bank that’s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), you’ll know that it’s protected up to allowable limits.\nDealing with cash for everyday expenses can be a bit cumbersome. Besides that, a bank account allows you to track your expenses in a single place, which can be helpful if you’re monitoring a budget or building a savings account. Paying bills online can also simplify the process (as opposed to buying stamps and mailing checks).\nAnother consideration? Interest. Cash hidden in the cookie jar or under the mattress can’t multiply. But an account that earns interest pays you just for keeping your money there. Rates of interest vary from bank to bank, and from account to account, so you may want to shop around before deciding where to stash your cash. Here’s more info on ways you can bank and services that are offered:\nWays to bank \nBranches\nA bank branch is a brick and mortar location where your banking can be done in person. You might pop into a branch for a roll of quarters or a cashier’s check you need right away. You may want to rent a safety deposit box to store valuables or important documents. Or maybe you just prefer talking to a banker in person when you have questions about how to choose the right products and services for your financial needs.\nOnline and mobile banking\nMany banks allow you to manage your money from a computer or smartphone—and lots of customers have embraced these options.\nSome online banking and mobile apps allow you to bank from almost anywhere on your own schedule. With 24/7 access, you can do everything from managing multiple accounts to paying bills to transferring money. For the banks offering mobile check deposit, simply snapping a photo of the front and back of a signed check will send the payment to the account you choose—no ATMs or extra trips involved.\nRound-the-clock access also helps some people stay organized. If balancing your checkbook on Sunday evenings suits you, no problem. As for staying ahead of your bills, most bank apps can text you a reminder that a bill is due or even alert you if your account dips below a certain dollar amount.\nConsumer and corporate banking\nWhat’s a consumer bank account? Just as you’d imagine, consumer banking refers to financial products geared toward everyday consumers. Also known as retail banking or personal banking, it’s the division of a bank that serves the general public.\nCorporate banking, on the other hand, refers to financial products that serve corporate customers. Also known as business banking, this division of a bank generally serves a wide range of clients, including small businesses, mid-sized businesses and large conglomerates that may have billions in sales and offices nationwide.\nCredit unions\nMany people wonder how a credit union differs from a retail bank. In general, credit unions offer the same services as a bank, such as checking accounts and personal loans. But unlike a for-profit bank, a credit union operates as a cooperative and is owned by its members.\nSo how do you become a member? You’ll likely have to be a member of a group to use a credit union and its services, but this is easier than it sounds. Some credit unions simply require you to live in a certain town or city. Some cater to employees who work at the same company. And others affiliate with churches or schools. You may also be able to join if a relative is already a member.\nOne thing to keep in mind about credit unions is that they may be smaller than many banks. So there may be fewer locations, ATMs, credit card options and credit card rewards programs.1\nThe FDIC does not insure credit unions, however, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) offers the same type of protection to federally chartered credit unions.\nOnline-only banking\nWhile most banks today offer online services, there are also banks that exist solely online. With lower operating expenses, those savings can often be passed along to customers in the form of lower monthly fees or higher interest rates on savings accounts.\nTelephone banking\nSome banks allow you the option of banking by phone. Simply call a phone number and speak to a bank employee to do things like check your balance, transfer money, pay bills or handle other banking needs. If you call outside of your bank’s regular business hours, you may have to use an automated system that will take you through the steps necessary to complete your transactions.\nBanking products and services \nChecking account\nWhen you’re thinking about what services banks provide, a checking account may be the first thing you think of. This popular type of account allows you to store and manage the money you use for everyday spending. Once set up, you can use a debit card or check, which will take money directly from your account, to pay for everything from groceries to gas to bills. You can also get cash from an ATM or branch using your debit card and PIN, a unique password you choose to protect your account.\nSavings account\nA savings account can help you separate the money you want to save from the money you need to spend. For many, it’s an easier way to work toward a goal, like saving for home improvements or building an emergency fund. Most savings accounts can automatically move money from your checking account into your savings account each month, so you don’t even have to think about doing it yourself. An added bonus is that banks usually pay you interest on savings accounts. That’s free money that may help you reach your financial goals a little faster.\nMoney market account (MMA)\nAn MMA is a type of savings account that often pays higher rates of interest than a typical savings account. The more you put away, the more you may be able to earn. One thing to keep in mind? There may also be limits on how many withdrawals you can make each month.\nCertificate of deposit (CD)\nA CD is a type of bank account where you agree to keep your money in the account for a certain amount of time. The amount of time can vary, but terms often range from as little as 6 months to as long as 5 years.\nThe longer you save, the greater the return. You can always decide to withdraw your money early. However, there’s a penalty for withdrawal before the end of your CD term.\nDebit card\nWith a debit card, you can pay for everyday expenses with just a swipe (and usually your PIN). The money will come straight from your checking account so there’s no need to carry cash if you prefer not to. Plus, if your debit card is lost or stolen, you may not be responsible for unauthorized transactions if you report it in a timely manner. Lost cash, unfortunately, is often lost for good.\nCredit card\nA credit card lets you pay for items with a line of credit. In essence, you’re borrowing the money and then paying it back when the bill comes. But remember that different credit cards charge different rates of interest, so it’s important to know what you’re agreeing to (so you don’t end up paying too much in the long run). One way to avoid paying interest is to pay your bill in full each month. You may also want to watch out for annual fees, especially if it’s a card with perks such as airline miles or cash back. Shopping around for a credit card with no annual fees is always an option.\nFinance terms 101 \nATM\nAn automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic bank that allows you to complete basic transactions without a branch or teller. You’ll just need your debit card and secure PIN. Some ATMs also allow deposits of cash or checks. While you don’t need to use your bank’s ATM to access your cash, you might have to pay a fee to use others. Many credit cards allow cash withdrawals as well, but this “cash advance” can come with a hefty fee, so be sure to find out beforehand.2\nFDIC\nWhen your money is in a bank that’s backed by the FDIC, you’ll know it’s safe and secure up to allowable limits. That’s because the U.S. government protects FDIC-insured deposits in the very rare event that a bank fails.3 You can use its BankFind tool to see if your bank is a member and to look up the maximum limit of deposited funds that are insured.\nDeposit\nAnytime you put money into your account, you’re making a deposit. You can usually deposit checks or cash at a bank, ATM or even on your mobile phone. Direct deposit is when your paycheck is transferred to your checking or savings account by your employer automatically on payday, which can save you time.\nWithdrawal\nAnytime you take money out of your account, you’re making a withdrawal. Just like with deposits, you can take out funds at a bank branch or ATM. When you write a check, wire money or use your debit card, the money is withdrawn automatically from your account.\nFees\nWhen it comes to different types of banking products, fees can vary widely. But it’s also possible to find fee-free accounts and services that will likely suit your needs. Common fees for services rendered by some banks include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees and ATM fees. If you want to avoid paying extra, it can be worth shopping around and comparing offers.\nNow that you’re familiar with a few more financial terms, products and services, you may feel a bit more confident about managing your money. The more you know about what banks have to offer, the easier it may be to make a plan that works best for your lifestyle and personal financial goals.",

  "text": "FDIC stands for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It was formed in the 1930s in response to the banking crashes that accompanied the Great Depression. It’s designed to keep America confident in its banks, but it also provides real-world safeguards for your money by doing precisely what its name implies: insuring your bank deposits.1\nJust like you pay car insurance premiums, American banks pay premiums to the FDIC. The FDIC in turn uses that money, plus other federal funds, to repay customers if a bank fails. The agency insures most American banks, making it responsible for trillions of dollars in deposits. It also regulates those banks, monitoring their health in an effort to avoid collapse.1\nThe FDIC insures several categories of deposit accounts. That includes what the agency calls single accounts, which covers checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs).2 But investments like stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other equities are not covered.3\nThe FDIC also limits how much money can be insured in a given account, meaning there are limits to what you can be paid back in the unlikely event that your bank closes. By getting to know the FDIC limits and how they work, you'll have the know-how to make the system work for you.",

  "text": "August 7, 2024 |5 min read\nSimply put, a checking account is a bank account designed to be used for everyday expenses. Checking accounts keep your money safe until you need it. And then allow you easy access when the time comes.1 Plus, some even pay interest to help your money grow.2\nWhen you need to make a purchase, you can access your money using a debit card, a checkbook or online banking services. If you need cash, you can typically use an ATM or visit a local branch of your bank. Money to deposit? There are plenty of ways to do that too.2\nKeep reading to learn more about how checking accounts work.\nAdvantages of a checking account \nSo why should you open a checking account, and what do you use a checking account for? You can use a checking account to manage the money that you earn and spend. Being able to see how much comes in and goes out every month may help you keep better track of where your money is really going. Some common uses for checking accounts include:\nEveryday purchases\nIf you receive a debit card when you open your new checking account, it will come in the mail with instructions for selecting your PIN—that’s the “personal identification number” that will help safeguard your account.3 Once it’s set up, you can use your debit card to buy anything from groceries to gas to movie tickets. Just be sure to memorize your PIN, as you may be asked to enter it during a transaction.\nYou can also make online purchases with your debit card. You may be asked to enter information such as your name, address and debit card number along with its expiration date and the three-digit code on the back of your card. \nHowever you use your debit card, the money will come directly out of your checking account.4 Just remember to keep an eye on your balance so you can try to avoid spending more than you have (more on that in a moment).\nPostage-free payments\nOne popular feature of most checking accounts is the option to pay bills online with just a few clicks.5 From utilities to credit cards, bills can generally be paid from the comfort of your office, couch or car (once you’re safely in park). In the bill pay area of your bank’s website, you can enter information such as the company you’d like to pay and the account number on your bill. Your bank may be able to help if you need a little guidance. Once each account is set up, you’ll see all of your payees, and if the vendor offers it, your monthly bills, in one place—which can make them easier to keep track of and harder to forget. This can help you avoid late payments and potential fees.\nSome banks even allow you to sign up for text or email alerts to let you know when a bill is due, if your balance drops below a certain amount or when a deposit or withdrawal has been made.\nPrompt paychecks\nGoing to the bank or another check-cashing business every time you get paid can be a hassle, not to mention the delays you may experience on weekends and holidays.\nWith direct deposit, your employer puts your paycheck straight into your bank account for you.6 No check cashing or travel expenses. If you’re interested, ask your employer if they offer direct deposit and how to get started. It’s usually a matter of filling out a single form. Just have your bank account information handy.\nYou might even be able to divide your paycheck between several different accounts. You might put the bulk of your check into a checking account for easy access and everyday needs, while sending a smaller amount to a savings account. For some people, this is the easiest way to get in the habit of saving, because it’s done automatically.\nUsing your checking account \nLet’s get down to checking account basics. After you open your checking account, you may find it helpful to keep a running balance. This means documenting every withdrawal or deposit you make from your account so you can balance your checkbook. This can help you avoid overdrawing your account and getting hit with fees.\nHow do I choose the right checking account? \nSince people use money in different ways, there’s no right answer for everyone. But as you’re looking at what checking accounts different banks have to offer—either online or at a local branch—there are a few things to think about:2\nFind out how much money you’ll need to deposit to open your new checking account. Some banks require an initial deposit, while others let you open an account and add money later.\nSee if the bank charges monthly maintenance fees or overdraft fees. Avoiding these may keep more money in your wallet, and that’s a win. Fee-free checking accounts and ATMs do exist, as well as overdraft protection options, which can shield you from fees if you spend more than you have in your account (oops). \nYou can even look for checking accounts that pay interest—that’s money you can earn just by keeping money in the bank. While checking accounts usually earn less interest than savings accounts, it may be worth exploring because every penny counts.\nFinally, be sure that the bank you choose is FDIC-insured. That’s the gold standard in banking that ensures your money is protected from a bank failure up to allowable limits.7\nChecking Account vs Savings Account \nIf you’re thinking about opening a checking account, consider what you’re looking for in a bank account. If you want an account for everyday spending with easy access to your money, a checking account may be right for you. Most come with debit cards that can typically be used wherever credit cards are accepted.8\nSavings accounts, on the other hand, are typically used for money that you don’t plan on accessing frequently.1 Savings accounts may have a monthly withdrawal limit and don’t come with debit cards.9 However, they generally come with higher interest rates than checking accounts.2\nNow that the meaning of a checking account is more clear, you can decide whether this is the right place to stash your cash.",

  "text": "July 31, 2024 |6 min read\nLooking for a convenient place to keep your money in between use that’s not the pocket of your jeans that winds up in a wad after a tango with the washer?\nA checking account might be just what you’re looking for. It’s a bank account used for everyday deposits and withdrawals—that means putting money into your account, taking it out or using your debit card in the place of cash.1\nThere are many benefits of a checking account, from easy access to your cash to direct deposit of your paycheck. Like with anything, there are checking account pros and cons, but let’s start with the advantages.\nAdvantages of checking accounts \nIf you're considering opening a bank account, there are lots of advantages to having a checking account. \nEarn interest: Some checking accounts earn interest, which means your money can grow even when it’s just sitting in the account.2\nFDIC insurance: If you’ve been keeping your money in jars or under your mattress, you may be interested in the security of a checking account. Most checking accounts have FDIC insurance and are covered up to the allowable limits.3\nEasy access: Checking accounts let you access your money in a number of ways. You can typically spend or withdraw money by visiting a bank, using your debit card at an ATM, writing a check or making an online transfer.\nDebit card: Most checking accounts come with a debit card, so instead of paying with cash, you can easily tap or insert your card into a card reader at checkout to pay directly with the money in your account. You can also pay online with your debit card by filling out the requested information, like your name and card number.\nDirect deposit: You can set up direct deposit into your checking account right from your employer.4 No more risk of losing paper checks in the mail. Your paycheck can be deposited into your checking account automatically on payday, which might be faster than getting it via mail, too.\nGet paid early: Some banks even offer early direct deposit, where you can get your paycheck up to 2 days sooner—so you can pay bills earlier and buy the things you need.\nTrack spending: With a checking account, there is a record of your deposits and spending, so you can see where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Plus, some checking accounts let you lock your debit card if it's ever lost or stolen—helping to prevent unauthorized use.\nDisadvantages of checking accounts \nWhile checking accounts are full of benefits, they have a few shortcomings to be aware of, too. Keep in mind that checking accounts vary from bank to bank, so be sure to look into what features come with yours.\nNo interest: While some checking accounts earn interest, most don’t. And the checking accounts that do earn interest typically have a lower interest rate than savings accounts. This is because a checking account is typically used like cash and isn’t intended for your money to sit still, whereas a savings account is more typically used for long-term savings that won’t be touched as often.\nFees: Another checking account disadvantage is that sometimes checking accounts have monthly fees. That means paying money to use your own money. The good news is that there are some free checking accounts that don't have monthly fees, which means more of your money stays yours, so be sure to check when you're choosing your account.\nMinimums: Some banks require you to keep a minimum balance in your checking account at all times. If you don’t, there might be a fee you have to pay. But remember, not all checking accounts are created equal, so if you’re worried about maintaining a minimum balance, look for a checking account that doesn’t have one.\nDifferent types of checking accounts \nIf you’re tired of keeping track of cash (and tangoing with soggy dollars in the washing machine), a checking account might be the right choice for you. Check out these different types of checking accounts.\nTraditional checking accounts: A traditional checking account typically offers checks, a debit card and ATM access. There’s also usually a physical bank location. There may or may not be fees, so be sure to check.\nOnline checking accounts: Online checking accounts provide services digitally. That means they may not have any physical locations for you to go to, but it also means that you can bank from wherever you are, online or on your phone.\nJoint checking accounts: Joint checking accounts have more than one account holder who can access the cash. This can be a good solution for married couples or college students and their parents. Another thing to keep in mind: Adding a joint account holder could increase the amount of FDIC insurance for the account.\nTeen and kid checking accounts: Some banks offer checking accounts made specifically for teens and children.5 They might have extra budgeting features or safety features, like the ability to set up savings goals and transaction text alerts for parents, that make them ideal for a first step into managing finances. These accounts typically require a parent or guardian to be a joint account holder.\nBusiness checking accounts: If you run a business, this could be the checking account for you. Business checking accounts make it easier for you to keep your personal money separate from your business finances.\nMoving your money into a bank account is a lot to think about. And choosing the right bank account for your needs is a personal choice. Consider these checking account advantages and disadvantages, as well as the features you’re looking for in a new bank account. If you’re interested in easy access to your everyday cash, a checking account might be the way to go.\nRelated Content\nArticle | July 31, 2024 \nBanking Basics\nBanking 101\nArticle | July 3, 2024 \n|5 min read \nArticle | August 7, 2024 ",

  "text": "August 1, 2018 |5 min read\n“Budget” is a simple little word, but it can strike fear in almost anyone. It brings to mind complicated spreadsheets, mind-numbing math and—perhaps most irritating of all—lots of seemingly random spending restrictions.\nWait, though. When it’s done in a balanced way, budget planning can be quite freeing and can lower your stress level about money. A balanced monthly budget can do more than just help you get by. It can help you save money toward other exciting things, like vacations, holiday gifts and the big one—college tuition.\nBetter yet, a balanced budget is pretty easy to create.\nThe 50/20/30 budgeting strategy\nWith this minimalist guide on how to make a budget, just split your monthly income into 3 simple buckets, or budget percentages:\n50% for Needs\n20% for Savings\n30% for Wants\nThis balanced way of budgeting, often referred to as the “50/20/30” approach, was popularized by Harvard bankruptcy expert and now-Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi. Many financial experts—and lots of “regular people”—now use this method. Here’s how it works:\n1. First, determine your monthly income\nThis is the money you have available to spend, after taxes. In addition to that net monthly paycheck, income includes any money from other sources:\nMoney earned from a side job\nAlimony and/or child support\nInvestment income\nGovernment benefits\nAdd up all of money sources. This is your monthly income.\n2. Figure out a 50% “Needs” target\nThis Needs budget bucket includes required monthly expenses:\nRent or mortgage\nUtilities (water, garbage, electricity, gas, phone)\nInsurance (including home/renters, car and health)\nFood (groceries only; eating out goes into the “Wants” category)\nTransportation (including commuter passes, tolls and gas)\nClothing\nCalculate 50% Needs \nMultiply your monthly income by 0.50. For example, if your after-tax income is $3,000, your Needs budget is $1,500.\nMonthly income ($3,000) x 0.50 (50%) = $1,500 (target Needs budget)\nA good goal, then, would be to spend no more than $1,500 per month, or 50% of your available monthly budget, on required expenses.\nSpending more than 50% on Needs? Consider trimming some fixed costs. Why? Putting too much money into your Needs category could mean you run short of money for Savings and Wants. Get ideas for cutting costs on food, utilities, insurance or commuting.\n3. Determine your 20% “Savings” amount\nSavings are an important part of any balanced monthly budget. Having money in savings means you’re less likely to go into debt to afford a big-ticket item or pay for an unforeseen expense.\nKeep in mind that debt payments (other than a mortgage) are also included in the 20% savings percentage. Why? Simplicity. After paying off student loans, credit cards or car loan, you can redirect that same money into a savings account.\nHere’s what’s included in the Savings budget bucket:\nEmergency fund\nRetirement savings and investments\nCredit cards, student loans and other non-mortgage debt payments\nOther savings goals (vacation, wedding, home improvements)\nCalculate 20% Savings If your monthly, after-tax income is $3,000, your Savings budget is $600.\nMonthly income ($3,000) x 0.20 (20%) = $600 (target Savings budget)\nPutting less than 20% into Savings? Free up more money by trimming expenses in the Needs and Wants buckets. Get tips on saving money fast and building an emergency fund. Consider putting Savings money in an easy-access savings account.\n4. Figure out your 30% “Wants” target\nIt’s OK to budget for fun stuff? Absolutely! Leaving a little room in the family budget for enjoyable things can keep everyone from feeling deprived.\nThe Wants budget bucket includes expenses for all the “extras”:\nRestaurant food, from eating out to getting coffee from the corner café\nEntertainment, like downloading movies and music\nExercise, such as gym memberships or yoga classes\nAfter-school activities for kids, including travel sports\nCalculate 30% Wants Using an after-tax income of $3,000, your Wants budget is $900.\nMonthly income ($3,000) x 0.30 (30%) = $900 (target Wants budget)\nSpending more than 30% on Wants? It’s the same drill: Look for creative ways to cut costs. And if you spend less than 30% on Wants, go back and make sure the Needs and Savings buckets aren’t too big. Don’t shortchange yourself here. Putting money toward some Wants may make it easier to resist “budget fatigue” and throwing away the monthly budget altogether.\n5. Add it up: 50 + 20 + 30 = 100% balanced family budget\nThat’s it! This is the simple formula for how to make a budget you can live with.\nOf course, this isn’t the only way to create a family budget. However, the main advantage of the 50/20/30 approach is that it’s clear and straightforward. It might even convince the most stubborn anti-budgeters to give it a try. When that happens, “budget” can stop being a dirty word and start being one of your family’s most helpful everyday resources.",

  "text": "Since minors generally can’t open bank accounts by themselves, you’ll typically need to be a joint owner of the account, which may actually be a good thing. It’ll give you the chance to compare banks and find features that are important to both of you. You can discuss pros and cons, make compromises and even adopt some new habits on this financial journey you’re taking together.\nMaybe your teen wants a bank account that’s free of fees and doesn’t require a minimum balance because they’re just getting the hang of this money thing. That’s not too hard to find. But maybe you’re mostly interested in tracking their spending. An issue like that may be worth a discussion, so your child understands where you’re coming from.\nFor instance, there are joint teen checking accounts that allow you to receive alerts every time your child makes a transaction. But should you? When it comes to monitoring your kid’s checking account, privacy parameters will be up to you. Navigating these options together will keep the lines of communication open.\nWith banking apps, everything from money transfers to mobile deposits can be done in minutes. However, impulse purchases with the swipe of a debit card are just as quick. This can be an opportunity to talk about the difference between “wants” and “needs.” For most people, finding a balance takes time, and managing a bank account is one way to practice.\nA teen checking account can even earn a little interest. If your teenager earns money on their own, they may be able to grow their money with interest.\nTogether, you can compare rates on checking accounts, savings accounts and even longer-term investment options like CDs. It can be an eye-opening exercise to see how your dollars may grow, depending on where you leave them.",

  "text": "October 23, 2018 |6 min read\nYou’ve introduced your child to so much of the world already, but money seems to be a conversation many parents have trouble starting. However, studies have shown that when you talk to your kids about money, they are more likely to save and be financially secure in their lives.1\nTruth be told, most parents don’t feel qualified to teach their kids about money because they’ve made money mistakes themselves. But you don’t need to be a financial adviser to explain money to a child and offer basic advice. After all, you may not have won the Tour de France, but you can still teach your kids to ride a bike. By teaching them about saving and paying bills, you can hopefully help your children avoid financial troubles as an adult.\nFrom toddlers to teenagers, every age brings unique opportunities to teach your kids about money. And according to Jayne Pearl, author of several books about financial parenting, you just need to start. “If your kid is ready to have a conversation, you can try to have a conversation. If it bombs, you can try again in a few months or next year, but I think it’s never too early to try.”2\nIt all adds up\nChildren start counting at around age 3 so that’s when some parents start teaching their kids about money. They won’t understand everything, but at 4 or 5 you can help your children understand that different types of money have different values. Show them how a quarter is worth more than 10 pennies, and how to add these coins together. They may not get it right away, but the goal should be to help them develop a basic understanding and get more comfortable around money.\nShow me the money\nIn a world where swiping cards to pay is so common, children who see cash find it easier to assign value to it.1 If you make an effort to carry real currency around, your children will start recognizing the different values of each bill and coin, which will help them better understand the concept of exchange.\nEasy as 1-2-3\nEven adults can find budgeting difficult. But to help children budget their money, you can keep it simple. Try putting aside 3 jars labeled “Spending,” “Saving” and “Sharing.” Whenever money comes in, encourage them to split the money among the jars. Put 50% in “Spending” to use whenever they like, 40% in “Saving” to go toward a particular goal and 10% in “Sharing” for gifts or donations.\nA penny saved\nSaving for the sake of saving is not something many children will understand. Instead, help your kids create a savings goal. If they really want a video game, change the “Saving” jar to the video game title. You can even measure the progress with a growth chart and a red marker to help visualize their savings. By teaching kids to save money, they may feel encouraged to put away even more to reach their goal.\nA penny earned\nHaving your children earn an allowance by completing chores can help them understand that money isn’t free. No chores. No allowance. Even if it’s only $5 a week, having a source of income will give them a chance to start managing money at a young age. You could also have your children earn money for larger chores like Susan Borowski, mother and author for moneycrashers.com. “The amount [my 13-year-old] earns depends on the difficulty of the task or how long it takes, so we discuss money each time he takes on a larger task.”3 This can help your kids develop a strong work ethic and have an appreciation for earning their money.\nMake money mistakes\nConsider letting your children manage their own money. You can offer some guidance, but you should know that letting them make a $10 mistake—like spending all their money on a toy they only use once—could save them from making a $1,000 mistake later on in college.2 It’s never an easy lesson to learn, but it’s better they learn it when the stakes are lower.\nAlso talk to your kids about money mistakes you’ve made. In general terms, you can mention how you may have spent too much on something or didn’t have enough savings when you wanted it. Help them learn from your experiences.\nAll the way to the bank\nOnce your child is around 9 or 10, they could be ready to go to the bank and open a real savings account. Remind them of their “Saving” jar, and create an even greater goal for this account. Whether it’s college, a car or an emergency fund, by now they’ll have a stronger grasp on how their savings can grow over time.\nGet what you pay for\nWhen your children reach middle school, it’s a good time to have them start paying for more things you used to buy for them. According to Jean Chatzky, financial editor of The Today Show, you can “come up with a list of things you have paid for in the past that you know your kids want, that you’re no longer going to pay for. Make them allocate their resources…research shows kids that get an allowance understand that credit is not an unlimited resource in the future.”4\nNo need for “wants”\nA few years later, when your child becomes a teenager, they should have a decent grasp of value and saving. But as they test their boundaries and develop new interests, your guidance can help them avoid common pitfalls. Discuss “wants” versus “needs.”5 You may even consider sharing your own finances to illustrate family necessities like your bills, food and home.\nExplaining money to a child doesn’t have to be difficult. You might start teaching kids about money as young as 3, but even if your children are older and almost ready to go off on their own, it’s still not too late to open up a dialogue and teach your kids money management. Share your advice and mistakes while offering lessons they can take with them. Providing some financial literacy for your kids as they grow can help them make smart money decisions for the rest of their lives.",

  "text": "July 31, 2024 |4 min read\nIf you’re ready to open a checking account, you may already have some financial needs in mind—like setting up direct deposit, paying bills or getting a debit card.\nVirtually any checking account will provide these basic services. But if you want to find an account that really fits your needs and budget, there are a few other factors worth considering. Here’s a simple, 5-step guide to walk you through the process:\n1. Gather your identification documents \nWhat’s required to open a checking account is probably right at your fingertips. If you open it in person, you’ll likely need two forms of ID (such as a driver’s license, Social Security card, passport or birth certificate) and proof of address (by way of a utility bill, mortgage statement, lease or similar document).1\nBut if you’re like most people, you may be wondering “Can I open a checking account online?” The answer is yes. You’ll simply enter information such as your date of birth and ID numbers on the bank’s application page. If you’re applying for a joint account, you will likely both need to verify your identities. Under 18? Banks may allow you to get a checking account if a parent or legal guardian is willing to be co-owner of the account.\nThose are the basic requirements for most people to open a checking account. If you don’t drive, you can get an ID card from your local DMV. If you’re not a U.S. citizen, you may just need an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number and proof of your identity to open a checking account.2\nNow that you know what to bring or have on hand to open a checking account, it’s time to learn about fees or—better yet—how to avoid them.\n2. Explore low- or no-fee accounts \nSome banks charge monthly service fees, maintenance fees, low-balance fees and ATM fees. If you’d rather avoid these charges (who wouldn’t?), be sure to go with a truly “fee-free” checking account so there are no surprises.\nSome banks charge their checking account holders $12 a month (or more) if they don’t maintain a balance of $1,500 or satisfy other requirements.3 That’s $144 a year! By shopping around, you can steer clear of these fees and most additional costs.\nSome banks require a minimum deposit, usually between $25 and $100, when opening a new account.1 Again, if this doesn’t suit your needs, no problem. There are checking accounts that require nothing at all to get started.\n3. Find features that fit your lifestyle \nEveryone’s banking needs are a little different, so think about your lifestyle and what you need your checking account to handle. Need to pay bills online? Do you travel and need ATMs in lots of locations? Maybe you want to deposit paychecks with your phone on the go. All totally doable. Just keep a list of “must-haves” handy as you compare banks.\nOverdraft protection is another option to think about. Say you lose track of your balance and spend more than you have in your checking account. Lots of people have been there a time or two (or three), which can result in a penalty. Luckily, there are checking accounts that come with a range of overdraft protection options that can keep those fees at bay.\n4. Earn a little interest \nBesides avoiding fees, you could actually make a little money just for keeping your cash in a checking account that earns interest for you.\nEven if your balance will be fairly low, it’s worth choosing a checking account that pays interest because every dollar counts. And remember, cash hidden under a mattress or in dresser drawers will never have the chance to grow.\n5. Bank on the go \nToday, checking accounts can be as mobile as you are, with apps that can sign you in with the swipe of a finger (rather than a password), send you instant alerts or transfer money quickly and securely.\nOnce you open your checking account, you can fully explore its features. Just be sure to review any confirmation materials you receive and follow the instructions for setting up your debit card, using your bank’s online services and keeping your account safe.\nThere’s no doubt about it: Opening a bank account is faster and easier than ever. But ensuring that it’s affordable and really fits your needs is what matters in the long run. So, shop around and find a checking account that has the features you’re after. You’ll be glad you did.",

  "text": "Settling on the right child allowance amount depends on your family’s finances and other factors. One popular place to start is with $1 per week for every year old they are.3 So if you start when your child is 6, he or she would get $6 a week, then $7 and so on.\nThis gets trickier when kids start needing money for gas and prom dresses. So what is a reasonable allowance for high school students?\nOn average, teenagers with allowances get the same weekly rate as younger kids—around a dollar for every year old they are.4 But as life gets more expensive, you could try to adjust kids’ allowances to what they actually spend, rather than just pay for it yourself.\nFor example, if your teenager is spending hundreds of dollars a month on gas, food, clothes and cell phone data, you might consider giving them that money up front and seeing if they can stick to a budget. \n“Young adults learn financial skills more and benefit when they have opportunities to make their own financial decisions,” the CFPB says, adding that having you as a safety net can help them learn from experience—and mistakes.1",

  "text": "September 26, 2023 |5 min read\nAn overdraft happens when you spend more than you have in your bank account and the transaction goes through, resulting in a negative balance. Since you’re using money from your account—and not borrowing money like you would with credit—an overdraft doesn’t appear on your credit report. So it shouldn’t affect your credit scores.\nHowever, there could be negative effects on your credit scores if you don’t resolve the overdraft. And you may not be able to open a new bank account in the future. Learn more about how overdrafts work and when they might affect your credit. \nKey takeaways\nOverdrafts don’t usually affect your credit scores unless you don’t resolve them quickly and the account goes into collections.\nChecking accounts aren’t included in your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus, but they could be included in your ChexSystems report.\nIf your bank offers overdraft protection and you opt for it, that could mean linking your checking account to a savings account, credit card or line of credit to cover potential overdrafts. Or your bank may cover the transaction and charge an overdraft fee.\nCapital One eliminated all overdraft fees for its consumer banking customers, but it still provides overdraft options. If your bank doesn’t offer overdraft protection or you don’t opt into it, a transaction that would result in a negative balance could be declined.\nWhat is an overdraft and how does it work? \nIf you spend more than you have in your bank account and your financial institution approves the transaction, that’s considered an overdraft. Overdrafts can happen when you use your debit card, write a check, withdraw money from an ATM or automatically pay a bill, for example. \nSome banks charge overdraft fees, while others have reduced or eliminated them. For example, Capital One doesn’t charge overdraft fees.\nWhat is overdraft protection? \nBanks might offer overdraft protection that account holders can opt into. One overdraft protection option may be linking your checking account to a savings account, credit card or other line of credit. That way, funds can be transferred to your checking account to cover any overdrafts. These transfers might still result in a fee, but it’s typically less than an overdraft fee. Another option is the bank could cover any overdrawn transactions, then charge you the overdrawn amount plus an overdraft fee. \nCapital One account holders can opt in for overdraft protection any time and choose their overdraft preference. If customers aren’t enrolled, transactions that would result in a negative balance are declined, and no fees are charged.\nHow overdrafts could affect your credit \nYour credit scores reflect information in your credit reports. Because checking accounts aren’t a type of credit, they don’t appear in your credit reports or affect your credit scores, and neither do overdrafts. \nHowever, if you don’t resolve your overdraft and the account goes into collections, that could affect your credit scores. That’s because the collection agency may report that information to the major credit bureaus.\nWhat is ChexSystems? \nWhile overdrafts won’t generally show up in credit reports from the major credit bureaus, they could show up in a ChexSystems report. ChexSystems is a consumer reporting agency that collects and reports information about deposit accounts, including checking and savings accounts. \nA ChexSystems report may include activities like:\nOverdrafts and bounced checks\nAccount openings and closings\nAccount applications\nSuspected identity theft\nYour ChexSystems report won’t usually affect your credit scores. But it could impact your ability to open new checking or savings accounts. That’s because financial institutions may check your ChexSystems report when they’re reviewing your application. So if you’re interested in opening a new account, it’s a good idea to know if you have an overdraft in your ChexSystems report.\nOverdrafts and credit FAQ \nHere are some of the common questions about overdrafts and credit:\nCan you overdraft a credit card?\nAn overdraft has to do with a bank account, not a credit card. But as part of overdraft protection, you may be able to link a credit card to your bank account to cover any transactions that go over your account balance. \nCredit cards typically have a credit limit. If you try to go over it, your card could either be declined or the transaction may go through and result in things like fees and a negative impact to your credit scores.\nDoes opening a checking account affect your credit score?\nOpening a checking account doesn’t typically affect your credit scores. That’s because your credit scores reflect information in your credit reports. And the three major credit bureaus don’t include checking account information in credit reports.\nDoes closing a checking account affect my credit score?\nClosing a checking account also doesn’t typically affect your credit scores since checking accounts don’t show up in your credit reports. However, if your account has been closed because of an unpaid negative balance, it could go into collections. And an account in collections could be in your credit reports and affect your credit scores.\nOverdrafts and credit in a nutshell \nAn overdraft doesn’t usually affect your credit scores. But if you wait too long to resolve it and the account goes into collections, your credit scores could be affected.\nNo matter what, it’s always a good idea to monitor your credit. CreditWise from Capital One is one way to do that. You can access your TransUnion® credit report and VantageScore® 3.0 credit score without hurting your credit scores. And it’s free for everyone, whether or not you’re a Capital One cardholder.",

  "text": "March 14, 2024 |7 min read\nThere’s a lot to the world of personal finance. Maybe you’re new to managing your own finances. Maybe you’re taking on new financial responsibilities. Maybe you just want to give yourself a refresher. Whatever the case, it can be hard to know where to start or how to ensure you’re making the right choices. \nLearn more about what it means to be financially literate and a few basic concepts to help you get started.\nKey takeaways\nFinancial literacy involves concepts like budgeting, building and improving credit, saving, borrowing and repaying debt, and investing.\nBecoming more financially literate might make financial decisions related to loans, major purchases and investments less daunting.\nThere’s no shortage of places to learn more about finances, but it’s important to learn from trustworthy sources.\nWhat is financial literacy? \nFinancial literacy is about understanding concepts like budgeting, building and improving credit, saving, borrowing and repaying debt, and investing—and having the ability to apply them to real-life situations. \nIf financial well-being is the goal, financial literacy can be the first step toward achieving it. Becoming financially literate means learning basic concepts so you’re able to make better-informed decisions about your money and work toward your financial goals. \nThere’s no wrong time to make efforts to improve your financial literacy, and there’s always something new to learn when it comes to personal finance. The more financially literate you become, the more it could help you take actions that may ultimately bring you closer to a state of financial well-being.\nThe 5 components of financial literacy \nThere’s plenty to learn about personal financial topics, but breaking them down can help simplify things. To start expanding your financial literacy, consider these five areas: budgeting, building and improving credit, saving, borrowing and repaying debt, and investing. \n1. Budgeting \nA key first step to take as you build your financial literacy is to learn healthy spending habits. One way to do this is by learning to budget. You could start by identifying monthly expenses to include in your budget, which can help you track your spending.\nBudgeting can help ensure that you’re not overspending on nonessentials. And avoiding extra expenses can create more room for essentials and savings. There are many methods of budgeting, including:\nThe 50-20-30 method: This method involves setting aside 50% of your take-home income for your needs, 30% for your wants and 20% for savings.\nThe zero-based method: Monthly expenses and savings are subtracted from your take-home income and should reach zero so every dollar is used with intention.\nThe envelope method: This involves creating categories for all your monthly expenses and putting certain amounts of your take-home income into physical or digital envelopes for each category.\n2. Building and improving credit \nYour credit scores affect many areas of your financial life. Among other major decisions, your ability to buy a house, lease a car and apply for a credit card are all impacted significantly by how good your credit score is. That’s why knowing where your credit stands—and what steps you can take to improve your score—can be so important.\nUnderstanding what affects your credit scores can help you work toward building a healthy credit history and a good credit score over time. But there are still things you can do to help improve your score faster. It can be helpful to:\nApply only for credit you need.\nUnderstand how closing credit cards might affect the length of your credit history.\nKeep your credit utilization ratio at 30% or below, a level recommended by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \nMonitor your credit reports for errors on a regular basis and keep tabs on your credit scores for changes.\nWatch your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Generally, lenders like to see DTI ratios between 28% and 36%.\nThe more you can increase your creditworthiness, the more likely you’ll be to receive favorable terms and better interest rates on credit cards and other loans.\n3. Saving \nLearning to save is another important aspect of financial literacy. Saving can be done in many ways, including through traditional savings accounts, retirement savings funds, investment portfolios and emergency funds. \nIt can be helpful to clearly define your savings goals so you know exactly how much you’ll need to put aside. Managing bills and other expenses at the same time can make saving seem difficult. But there are ways to save money while paying off debt.\n4. Borrowing and repaying debt \nAt some point in your life, you’ll likely need to borrow money and take on some kind of debt to achieve a personal or financial goal or need, like attending college or completing renovations on your home. \nPersonal loans, mortgages and auto loans could all impact your credit and your financial situation by increasing the total amount of debt you have at any given time. And the more loans you have, the more you’ll have to pay toward your debts each month. But those same loans can make it easier for you to afford items that may otherwise be a financial stretch.\nCredit cards are another form of debt that can help with more than just everyday expenses. With responsible use, you can use a credit card to build credit. That means doing things like paying your statement balance on time each month and monitoring your credit utilization.\nUnderstanding the impact that taking on debt will have on your finances and establishing a concrete plan for paying down that debt and paying it on time are crucial when it comes to being financially literate.\n5. Investing \nOnce you’ve strengthened your grasp on budgets, credit, savings and debt, it can be wise to begin educating yourself on additional ways to build wealth and save for retirement.\nLearning about stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other types of investment opportunities might be a place to start. But it’s important to remember that investing involves risk. And there are different levels of risk and return, depending on the investment.\nWhy is financial literacy important? \nBy becoming financially literate, you’ll be better able to make important financial decisions while understanding how those decisions will impact your current and future financial situation. This can help you reach your goals, build your savings, manage your money and avoid or navigate potential setbacks that could take a toll on your finances.\nThe benefits of becoming financially literate \nNow that you understand why financial literacy matters, it may be helpful to see how financial literacy can directly benefit you:\nIt can help you prepare for emergencies: When you’re financially literate, you may be better able to assess your needs and plan for worst-case scenarios. This awareness may help you establish emergency savings so you can deal with financial strain without relying solely on loans and credit cards.\nIt can help you manage debt more effectively: Financial literacy can help you understand how each of your debts impacts your finances in the short and long term. This could make managing your debt easier and set you up to prioritize payments in a way that can ultimately reduce financial strain.\nIt can help you reach your goals: Financial literacy helps you be fully aware of your situation and how different money moves can impact your finances in the future. This may make it easier for you to reach your goals and stay motivated as you work toward achieving them based on your financial planning efforts.\nIt may improve your spending habits: Overspending can be a major problem for many people. But when you’re financially literate, you can fully understand how overspending will impact your finances. This could help you improve your spending habits so you can better manage your debt and save for the future.\nHow to become financially literate \nThe world of personal finance is ever-evolving. Making financial literacy a lifelong pursuit can help you stay informed and put you on a path to financial well-being.\nAs you begin to educate yourself on these personal finance topics to become more financially literate, it’s wise to choose your informational resources carefully. Here are a few places you might start:\nMyMoney.gov: A financial education website that was developed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Literacy and Education Commission\nConsumer education: A section of the CFPB website that provides readers with tools and information that can help them make more informed financial decisions\nInvestor.gov: A website created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to help readers learn more about how to invest and protect their investments\nConsumer advice: A website created by the Federal Trade Commission to help readers learn how to report fraud, avoid scams and educate themselves about finances\nLearn & Grow: A section of Capital One’s website that features helpful articles specifically geared toward helping readers gain a better understanding of a wide variety of personal finance topics\nFinancial literacy in a nutshell \nDeveloping financial literacy can be an important part of managing money and reaching your financial goals. And there are simple steps you can take to increase your financial knowledge and confidently apply what you learn.\nYou can get an idea of where your credit stands and monitor your progress with CreditWise from Capital One. It’s free, even if you’re not a Capital One customer, and using it won’t hurt your credit score. Plus, it has tools like the CreditWise Simulator that can help when you have to make financial decisions.",

  "text": "Whether you want to pay off debt, increase your income or save for a down payment, setting financial goals can help you plan for the life you want. But when it comes to financial planning, knowing where to start may seem overwhelming. The good news is that there are steps you can take to manage your money and reach your milestones.\nRead on to learn how to set financial goals and the strategies that could help you achieve them. \nKey takeaways\nFinancial goals are the money milestones you set to reach your wants and needs.\nA money management strategy is typically required in order to reach a financial goal.\nFinancial goals can be short term, like saving for a family vacation, or they can be long term, like saving for retirement. \nUsing goal-setting guidelines—like the SMART formula—could help you break down large financial goals into smaller tasks.\nWhat are financial goals? \nFinancial goals are the money milestones you set to reach your wants and needs. They can be great ways to orient yourself toward saving for the future. \nHowever, everyone’s financial situation is different. Your financial goals may depend on your current debt, cash flow or lifestyle. And your short-, mid- and long-term plans could also influence how you save and invest your money.\nExamples of financial goals \nHere are some common examples of financial goals at every stage of life:\nExamples of short-term financial goals \nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), short-term goals may take less than five years to achieve. They may include goals like:\nCreating a budget: Calculating your net income, living expenses and disposable income can help you understand your current financial situation and prioritize your spending. The 50-20-30 rule is a popular budgeting method that recommends using 50% of your income for expenses, 20% for savings and 30% for wants.\nImproving financial literacy: Setting financial goals may feel intimidating at first, but there are online resources that can help you learn about financial concepts. Knowing how to manage money can help you make decisions that support your long-term goals. \nSaving for a vacation: Financial goals aren’t only for needs, after all. Saving for vacation ahead of time can also save you the headache of money worries once you get there.\nExamples of mid-term financial goals \nIt may take five to 10 years to reach a mid-term financial goal. These goals may include:\nPaying off debt: If a chunk of your budget is going to high-interest debt payments each month, you won’t have as much money to put toward your saving or investing goals. The good news is that there are strategies you could use to pay off credit card debt or student loans so you can free up your finances.\nImproving your credit scores: Your credit scores are instrumental to your financial foundation because lenders could use them to determine your creditworthiness. They can affect your eligibility for loans or credit cards and the interest rates they come with.\nBuilding an emergency fund: An emergency fund is a dedicated savings account that you can use to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into your other accounts. The Fed recommends keeping at least three months of expenses in this fund.\nExamples of long-term financial goals \nLong-term goals, such as the following, may take more than a decade to accomplish:\nSaving for a down payment on a house: Buying a home is a great financial goal, but it typically requires saving for a down payment. It’s also important to consider how closing costs and private mortgage insurance payments could affect your down payment and home buying budget. \nSaving for retirement: There are different types of retirement funds—like traditional and Roth IRAs—that could help you reach your long-term financial goals. You could also see if your employer offers plans like 401(k)s or 403(b)s. Some companies even offer 401(k) matches as a fringe benefit.\nSaving for a child’s college education: If you have kids, saving for their future education may be a priority. Some people use 529 plans to prepare for college costs.\nHow to set financial goals \nDeciding on a financial goal is great, but that’s only half the battle. Knowing how to use goal-setting strategies can help you achieve your monetary milestones. Some experts recommend the SMART guidelines for setting financial goals. These guidelines may help you break down large goals into smaller, easy-to-track tasks. \nSMART stands for: \nSpecific: Specify the tasks you need to complete to reach your goal.\nMeasurable: Decide how you’ll track your progress.\nAttainable: Is the timeline doable? Does any part of the goal feel overwhelming? It’s important to ask questions, evaluate your progress and set realistic expectations. \nRelevant: Consider whether the goal aligns with your values and your desires for the future.\nTime-bound: You could set timelines for reaching your goals and break down large goals into smaller tasks that have their own deadlines.\nHow to prioritize and achieve financial goals \nWhen you have a financial goal in mind, it’s important to consider the timeline needed to achieve it. Prioritizing your goals can help you chart a time frame and develop an investment strategy that you can balance with your current lifestyle. \nIf you’re looking to improve your financial health, here are some steps you may want to take:\n1. Analyze your expenses \nTracking your expenses will help you determine your current cost of living and the amount of money you can realistically use for savings and debt payments.\n2. Focus on short-term goals first \nIt may be helpful to prioritize certain financial goals—like building an emergency fund—over less-pressing goals, such as saving for a vacation. Starting with smaller, more achievable goals—like paying off your smallest debt—can free up resources and help you fund your larger goals.\n3. Make savings automatic \nDirect deposits or recurring transfers can make it easy to save and invest money. Automating contributions can reduce the temptation to spend these funds on other things.\n4. Track your progress \nIt could be helpful to dedicate different accounts for different goals. This strategy could organize your finances so you can track your progress.\n5. Use the right accounts for your goals \nA high-yield savings account or a money market account (MMA) may help you save for your near-term goals. These types of accounts could give your money some padding from inflation while keeping your assets liquid. \nMoney market and savings accounts could also help you save for mid-term goals. You could also consider a certificate of deposit (CD). Many CDs require funds to remain in the account until the account’s maturity date. If you withdraw money early, you may have to pay a penalty. However, some CDs may not have early withdrawal fees.\nRetirement accounts—like 401(k)s and IRAs—can help you financially prepare for the future. These accounts are meant for long-term investing. If you need to withdraw money early, you could face a penalty. Again, if your employer matches your contributions, using them can help you have more savings for retirement.\n6. Talk to a professional \nYou don’t have to become an expert overnight. A certified financial planner can work with you to create savings and investment strategies tailored to your goals.\n7. Readjust and refine as needed \nHaving timelines for short-, mid- and long-term goals can help you track your progress and shift priorities as needed. Scheduling regular check-ins can help you see where you stand and help you figure out next steps.\nFinancial goals in a nutshell \nSetting a financial goal is a step toward financial security and success. As you work toward your monetary targets, remember to track your progress and adjust your plans as circumstances change. \nIf building your credit score is on your list of financial goals, consider CreditWise from Capital One. With CreditWise, you can monitor your VantageScore® 3.0 credit score and access your TransUnion® credit report at any time.

  "text": "Today, Capital One announced it will completely eliminate all overdraft fees and non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees for its consumer banking customers. Capital One will continue to provide free overdraft protection. \nCapital One is America’s 6th-largest retail bank and the only top-10 retail bank to make this move for all of its consumer bank products. \n“The bank account is a cornerstone of a person’s financial life,“ said Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s Founder and CEO. “It is how people receive their paycheck, pay their bills and manage their finances. Overdraft protection is a valuable and convenient feature and can be an important safety net for families. We are excited to offer this service for free.”\nFairbank continued, “Long ago, we set our sights on reimagining banking. Our award-winning checking accounts already feature no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements. Eliminating overdraft fees is another step in our effort to bring ingenuity, simplicity and humanity to banking.”\nCustomers can choose whether or not to access overdraft protection. All customers currently enrolled in overdraft protection will be automatically converted to No-Fee Overdraft on the launch date in early 2022.

  "text": "The standard overdraft fee isn’t the only one you risk if you bring your account below $0. There are other similar fees—non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees, overdraft protection fees and extended overdraft fees. Like the standard overdraft fee, these related fees also differ from bank to bank, so be sure to ask about them before opting into overdraft service.\nStandard overdraft fee\nThis is a fee many banks charge when you overdraft your account. Be aware that this isn’t a one-time fee—you can be hit with it each time you overdraft. This typically costs around $35.\nNon-sufficient fund (NSF) fee\nUnlike the standard overdraft fee, this is a fee the bank can charge if they decline a transaction that overdrafted your account. Another difference? Banks aren’t required to have customers opt in to NSF fees.1 Sometimes called insufficient funds fees, they’re common with bounced checks and automatic bill payments.1 And the fee typically costs the same as an overdraft fee.\nOverdraft protection fee\nAlso known as a transfer fee, you may incur this if you overdraft and your overdraft service is linked to a savings account or credit card.\nExtended overdraft fee\nYou may incur this fee if you overdraft your account and don’t replenish it within the next 5 to 7 days. This fee is usually given in addition to the standard overdraft fee—and you may keep getting hit with it if you keep your account in the negative. But like all fees, it differs from bank to bank.4\nBottom line: Like stepping on gum in your new shoes, having an overdraft isn’t ideal—but it happens. If you’re considering enrolling in your bank’s overdraft service, be sure to talk to them first about the rules and fees involved.",

  "text": "August 14, 2024 |4 min read\nWe live in the age of on demand. When you want to watch the latest summer blockbuster, get dinner from your favorite taqueria or find a ride to your friend’s birthday party, all you need to do is go online. And more and more, people are looking for a safe way to bank on demand, too.\nThis convenient option makes it possible for you to pay bills, deposit checks and keep an eye on your balance from almost anywhere. But if you’re new to online banking, you might be thinking, \"Are online banks safe?\"\nThe good news is many banks have features in place to protect you if you want to deposit your paycheck in your pajamas or pay the water bill from the sidelines of your kid’s soccer game. And as with other types of banking, there are things you can do that can help make your online banking experience even more secure.\nDon’t spend all night wondering to yourself \"how safe is internet banking?\" Instead, read on to learn more about how online banking security works and how to keep online banking safe.\nGetting to know online banking security \nPart of figuring out if online banking is safe and secure has to do with the technology many banks use to protect your data:\nMulti-factor authentication can be essential to safe online banking. It requires you to prove your identity in 2 or more ways before you’re let into your online bank accounts, and it can be a lot more difficult to hack.1 A password, PIN or physical card can be used to identify you. And so can biometrics like your fingerprint.\nResearch your bank to find out what online banking security measures it offers, and if you need to opt into certain ones, such as alerts. At many banks, an alert can be a call, text or email.\nIt may never have occurred to you that you’d want to be on a texting basis with your bank, but features like these can make it quick and easy to resolve problems. At many banks, if you receive an alert that indicates something is wrong, banking online means you can report a problem or disable your debit card with the simple click of a button from your desktop or mobile app.\nHabits that can help keep your accounts safe \nYou’re on your way to pick up a sofa you found online, and you’ve just made a pit stop at the ATM. With your wallet full of cash, you might be a little more cautious than usual. Maybe you take out your earbuds. Or maybe you move your wallet to your front pocket.\nWhen banking online, it can also be a good idea to take extra precautions, on top of what your bank is doing. While there’s not one safest way to bank online, these are a few of the best online banking security practices to try out:\nLook out for phishing emails or phone calls. If you receive a message from your great aunt Rosemary saying she was robbed in London and needs cash fast, but you know Rosemary hasn’t left Florida in 10 years, think twice before sending it. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warns against responding to unexpected requests for money or personal information.2\nPick strong passwords, and change them often. If a password is obvious to you, it could be obvious to someone else. Your wedding anniversary? Maybe not such a good idea. The anniversary of your first loose tooth? That’s random, but better. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has tips to help you choose your passwords.\nKeep your devices current. Treat anti-virus software as if it were a new Vietnamese restaurant or album from your favorite artist: Don’t sleep on it. The FTC suggests downloading anti-virus or other trustworthy security software onto your computer or phone and setting it to update automatically.3 Regularly backing up your files can be a good idea, too. If your data is hacked or tampered with, this can help you recover your records—including that list of Vietnamese restaurants to try.\nReconsider public Wi-Fi. When you access sensitive information (like your bank account) from an unsecured network (such as logging on at an airport), unauthorized users may be able to get access too.4 Catching up on cat videos? Totally OK on public Wi-Fi. But if you’re concerned with how to protect online banking, it’s probably best to bank from your home network.\nGood habits like these can protect you against the security risks of online banking by making it more difficult for someone else to access your account. \nIf you see something, say something \nSo you’ve done everything right, you’re reviewing your bill, and there it is: a $100 charge for pet shampoo. You don’t even have a dog. First, you might ask your significant other if they’ve visited any animal shelters lately. But if the answer is no, don’t panic.\nNo one wants to see a mistake on their bank statement. Be sure to report it to your bank as quickly as possible.5 You can also learn more from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about what to do if you notice an unauthorized transaction on your account.\nSo, how secure is online banking today? Let’s just say it can be a great option if you like living the digital life, don’t have time for regular bank visits or just don’t feel like putting on real pants. (We don’t judge.)\nIt’s normal to have concerns about online security. But when you take advantage of the many resources available to you at your bank, you can enjoy the convenience of online banking with more peace of mind.",

  "text": "August 21, 2024 |4 min read\nImagine if you could travel back in time 200 years. You’d tell your relatives that people can now bank using a tiny gadget. No more long horse rides into town to visit the bank—just take out a smartphone and voila, your bank is right there in your hands.\nBanking has come a long way. Now, you have your choice of whether to bank in person or remotely. What’s more, smartphones make it easy for you to do everything from check balances to pay bills from just about anywhere. Today, there are even banks that are online only. There was a time when you had to decide between online banks vs. traditional banks. But now, many banks have both options, so the difference between online banking and traditional banking boils down to personal choice. Some people prefer walking into a traditional bank branch while others want the convenience of connecting 24/7.\nOnline vs. traditional banks \nThese days, there’s really not a huge difference between traditional banking and online banking. If you compare online banking vs. traditional banking, you’ll see they usually offer pretty similar services.\nThe main difference is the option to bank in person. With banks that are online only, you may only be able to do your banking over the internet, through an app, at an ATM or by telephone. But most traditional banks offer online banking options, too. At traditional banks, you can do things like check balances, deposit money and pay bills. Most traditional banks also allow you to open accounts online, too. Traditional banks have added online banking in order to give their customers the best of both worlds: in person and online access.\nWhat are online banks? \nMost online banks are just like traditional banks in that they try to offer easy options for depositing money and paying bills. With an online bank, you can typically access your account on the internet or through a mobile app. ATMs may also be an option, but there may be fees in some cases.1\nOne benefit of most online banks is that they usually don’t have the same costs as physical locations. Because of that, they might be able to pass some of their savings to you with lower fees and higher interest savings rates on your deposits.1\nOnline vs traditional savings account \nA big difference between online savings vs. traditional savings accounts is how much interest you can earn. Online banks often offer higher interest rates on savings accounts than traditional banks.1 Before deciding where to open a savings account, compare the APY. The APY is the annual percentage yield, and it represents the amount of interest your savings will earn in a year.2\nAnother contrast between online and traditional savings accounts is that with a traditional account, you can bank in person. Because of that, some people still prefer traditional banking vs. e-banking (which is what some people call online banking). Others simply are not comfortable doing their banking online.\nAre online banks safe to use? \nYep, online banks are considered safe if they are a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Savings accounts at both traditional and online banks, covered by the FDIC up to allowable limits, protect you from bank failure. Online banks in the U.S. have to follow the same rules and regulations as traditional banks.3\nWhile online banks are typically just as safe as traditional banks, it’s important to make sure that your transactions are secure. That means choosing passwords that are hard for anyone to guess. You also should protect your personal information and take precautions when using public Wi-Fi. And if you see anything suspicious, like emails from bank addresses you don’t recognize, be sure to contact your bank right away.\nWhile your great, great grandparents may have had their minds blown, online banking has become a popular preference for anyone who wants access to their bank anytime and from just about anywhere. Choosing between an online and traditional bank really comes down to personal preference. While some online banks offer higher interest rates, the gap between online and traditional banks is getting smaller. For some people, being able to go into a branch is important. But for others, the ease of online banking is all they really need.",

  "text": "Once you’ve decided which bank you want to use, it’s time to fill out your application online. If you’re under 18, you may need a guardian to co-sign the account. The application process will vary from bank to bank. But all banks are required to verify your identity.5 So it’s helpful to have the following things handy:\nYour driver’s license, passport or other government-issued ID card\nSocial Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)\nA blank check, debit card or credit card to make that first deposit\nAnd you’ll usually need an email address, mailing address and a phone number. Once you have that ready, here’s how to open a bank account online:\nGo to the bank’s website. Stay safe! Any time you’re entering personal information online, take extra care. Find the link to \"open an account.\" (Scroll down the homepage to the site map if you’re having trouble finding the link.)\nChoose the type of account you want. Most banks let you compare different kinds of accounts to help you decide. Do you want an individual account or do you want to open a joint account online? Do you want things like overdraft protection and the ability to earn interest? From checking and savings accounts to CDs and IRAs, there are many types of accounts you can open online.\nFill out an application. Next, you’ll enter all of your personal information. You might also set up your username and password and create security questions to help protect your account.\nAgree to let the bank collect some information. Sometimes, submitting your application will automatically begin the approval process, but some banks might ask you to review disclosures and privacy policies first. In some cases you’ll have to answer a few legal questions then check a box that lets the bank collect information about you and your credit.\nCheck the approval process. Some banks will tell you if you’re approved right away, while others might take a bit longer. You can always sign in later to check on the status of your application or call the bank if you have questions. If you’re not approved, you might have to go into the branch to finish the process.\nMake your first deposit. Once you’re approved, you’ll want to put some money in your new account. You can do this from another account online or over the phone. If it’s your first account, you may need to do this step in person with cash or a check.\nWith your account set up, you’re all ready to begin banking online! Depending on the account and its features, you may be able to write checks, pay bills with your bank account online, set up direct deposit and more right away. And remember: Always keep your username and password in a safe place where no one can find it.\nDown the road, you may wonder \"Can I close a bank account online?\" You can, but each bank handles it a bit differently. Gather your account information, then check your bank’s policy on its website. Or call or stop by if you’d prefer to discuss it in person.6\nBanking today brings lots of choices, including the ability to get a whole lot done from the comfort of your home. From opening an account to paying bills, online banking was built for convenience–yours.\nOf course, there will always be hoops to jump through, but making things simpler while safeguarding your money is what online banking is all about.",

  "text": "Spark Business Card Questions\nWhat information will I need to provide when I apply?\nYou will need to know some basic personal information, as well as some information about your business—including your business’s total annual revenue and your business Tax ID Number or Employer ID Number.\nWhat do you mean by Tax ID Number (TIN) or Employer ID Number (EIN)?\nThis is a nine-digit number that’s assigned to nearly every U.S. business by the IRS to ensure tax compliance. It’s like the equivalent of a Social Security Number for a business. A business tax ID is required for business card applications for all business structures except Sole Proprietorships.\nCan I apply for a business card by phone?\nYou can apply for a business card online or by calling 1-866-390-5934. Or, if you received an offer in the mail, you can apply by calling the phone number listed on your letter, online or by mail. Please refer to the reservation number and access code listed in your letter.\nHow can I contact Capital One about my business card application?\nIf you have questions about an application that you’ve already submitted, please call 1-800-903-9177 to speak with an experienced customer service representative.\nHow quickly can I expect to get my card?\nOnce your application has been approved, you should receive your business card within 10 business days.\nCan I pay my bill online?\nYes. Once you get your business card, you can enroll in online banking to pay your bill. You can also mail your payments using U.S. Mail or expedited mail service such as FedEx. You can find our mailing address on our contact us page.\nCan I change my payment due date? \nYes. After your account is open, you can call Customer Relations to request a different payment due date.\nHow do I transfer a balance from another account to my Capital One account?\nAfter your account is open, you can call Customer Relations to discuss your balance transfer options. You will not be able to transfer a balance from another account issued or acquired by Capital One or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.\nWhat other benefits does this card offer for my business?\nWith your card, you'll get numerous benefits, such as a year-end summary to help you track expenses by category, $0 fraud liability if your card is ever lost or stolen and employee cards upon your request at no additional cost. check out our full list of business credit benefits.\nHow do you apply my payments?\nWe apply your minimum payment to lower rate balances (including 0% APR) before higher rate ones. We apply any portion of your payment in excess of your minimum payment to higher rate balances before lower rate ones. If your payment exceeds the minimum payment by an amount sufficient to pay a higher rate balance shown on your statement, you still may have a balance at that higher rate on your next statement as a result of transactions, interest, or fees charged to your account before your payment was credited. For example, if your monthly statement shows a $1,000 balance for cash advances, sending in a check for $1,000 plus your minimum payment amount may not bring your cash advance balance to $0. This is because interest continues to accrue on the $1,000 balance between the last day of the statement and the date we receive your payment, but the interest does not post to your account until the next statement.",

  "text": "August 7, 2024 |5 min read\nThere was a time when every act of banking required parking your car, walking inside, waiting in line and interacting with a human bank teller. While some may still prefer a physical banking experience, you should know there’s a long list of services offered by online banking. With no lines and 24-hour access, online banking is a convenient and easy option worth considering. \nPhysical banks aren’t going away, but if you’re new to online banking or are looking to better utilize advancing technology, here is a list of online banking services that may make your financial life a little easier.\nOpening an account \nWhether you want a checking account, a savings account, or even a CD or money market account, many banks allow you to open the account without stepping foot in a branch. That means less time and less hassle.\nDepending on the bank, you’ll need personal details like your driver’s license number and your Social Security number. If you have those handy, you may be able to start banking online in a matter of minutes.1\nMobile deposits \nYou can probably still picture the experience: the stacks of deposit slips, the pens chained to the desk, plastic tubes ferrying your money into the ether. Depositing money was one of the last transactions that required traveling to the bank. While you can still visit your branch if you really miss those pens, you now have more options when it comes to depositing your checks.\nOf all the online banking benefits and advantages, few save more time than mobile deposits. Many bank apps now allow customers to endorse a check, photograph it and deposit it in a matter of minutes—an act so seamless it feels a little like magic. Banks sometimes place limits on how much you can deposit in a single transaction or over the course of a day, and sometimes all of the funds aren’t available immediately.2 But even with those limitations, depositing a check by app is a great time-saving perks of online banking features and services.\nOnline (and automatic) transfers \nSaving money can be challenging. Banks with online banking services make it a little easier. Instead of having to write a check from one account to another, you can simply transfer money from your checking into your savings account with a few clicks.\nMaybe you’re saving up for a trip across the pond. You could occasionally jump online and move some money from checking to savings, which on most bank sites can be done in a few clicks. Many banks also allow you to set up automatic transfers at scheduled times.3 Each week or month, you can have your bank transfer money from checking to savings, keeping you on track for that trip. Or you can have a portion of your paycheck transferred into savings every pay period, keeping you on track without even thinking about it.\nTransferring money between accounts to friends or family is another one of the services provided by online banking. If you’re out to dinner with a group or chipping in on a big birthday gift, you can easily send money from your account without having to ask if anyone has change for a $20.\nOnline bill pay \nWhether it’s your cell phone carrier or cable provider, most companies allow you to pay bills on their websites. But it can be hard to keep track of all those accounts, which is where the financial services for online banking really comes in handy.\nSetting up bill pay on your bank's website or mobile app brings all of your bills to one location. From a single page, you can add or delete payees, pay a one-time charge or schedule recurring payments (like rent) for automatic monthly withdrawal.4 The bank will even mail physical checks if you prefer.5 No more missing a payment if you're out of town or out of stamps.\nBuilding a budget \nThere are all types of online banking services that can help you manage your budget. But helping you track your spending may be the most crucial.\nMany banks allow customers to see exactly how they’re spending their money by automatically categorizing each expense as “groceries,” “entertainment” and so on. Some banks even break that spending into handy graphics, allowing you to visualize just how much of your money you spend on dining out. Other banks allow you to set up specific saving goals, so you can identify what you’re saving for, track your progress and even celebrate your success. All this makes it easier than ever to build and track your personal financial budget.\nOnline banking security \nOf course, banking online raises questions about security. Will your money—and your personal information—be safe?\nMost banks take steps to keep your account safe, including secure sign-in procedures, automated alerts about suspicious purchases and other measures to protect you and your money. You can also take measures to protect your personal information and safely use public Wi-Fi.\nAccessing money \nEven if you don’t have a physical bank to walk into, you still have many ways to access your money. You could connect your debit card with a mobile wallet app on your smartphone and pay digitally. If you need to pay someone back, you can transfer money between accounts to friends or family. And if you need cash, you could visit the ATM or get cash back when you use your debit card.\nCustomer service \nSome problems are just more easily solved by talking to a real person. While you may not get the face-to-face interaction from online banking, you can generally reach out by phone to customer service representatives who spend their days helping solve issues. So if you ever have a problem, you have access to someone who can help at your fingertips\nMobile banking apps \nYou probably use apps on your smartphone every day. You can manage your online banking just as easily as checking the weather. With a tap of your finger, you’ve got all your account information and banking capabilities available to you. And depending on your phone, your fingerprint can serve as your password to keep your account secure.\nOther online banking benefits and advantages \nIf you haven't touched your checkbook in a while, it's probably because your debit card is doing the heavy lifting. And bank card online services get more robust each day. Most banks let customers compare and order debit cards online, report cards missing or stolen, and get quick and easy credit reports. All of these services combine to make bank cards as convenient and secure as they’ve ever been.\nBanks are a wonderful resource, but there are so many things you can do online—from paying your bills to making a savings plan to seeing exactly how much you spent at your favorite takeout joint last month. For these and other reasons, it’s worth getting to know your bank’s online services.",

  "text": "With a certificate of deposit (CD) account, you can save money for a fixed amount of time, called a term. In return for leaving your money in the CD, you earn a fixed interest rate—unlike traditional savings accounts, which have variable interest rates that are subject to change. Capital One CD terms range from 6 months to 60 months. Keep in mind, you can’t access your money until your CD term ends without incurring a penalty. \nSince CD account rates are often higher than traditional savings accounts, CDs are a great way to reach your savings goals faster using money that you don't need immediately.\nLearn more about CDs.",

  "text": "January 10, 2024 |4 min read\nEditor's note: This article has been updated from its original publication Aug. 17, 2023\nWith interest rates near their highest level in more than 15 years, business owners and investors are looking to stabilize their finances and mitigate risk. We asked Joel Essington, managing director and head of corporate rates derivatives origination for Capital One, for strategies and tactics they can adopt to cope with market volatility and financial uncertainty. \nQ: Why does managing interest-rate risk matter for businesses? \nJE: No one can predict the future, and companies should be in the business of running their business and not speculating or taking a view on how the debt markets and interest rates will perform. An effective risk strategy can smooth out some of the volatility and introduce the concept of greater predictability independent of what happens to interest costs. \nQ: How does interest-rate volatility impact financial performance? \nJE: It’s entirely capital-structure dependent. When you combine the dynamic nature of corporate balance sheets and introduce the concept of interest rate volatility and financial risks into that equation, it raises concerns about earnings stability, cash-flow generation, and so forth. Most businesses, especially publicly traded ones, want certainty and visibility. They want the ability to budget and plan and forecast accurately to their investors. So mitigating interest-rate risk should be front of mind, especially with markets like they are today.\nQ: Given that low interest rates persisted for so long, is it harder for businesses to shift their interest-rate strategies today? \nJE: We've been spoiled for a long time in terms of a low volatility, low nominal-rate environment. And there certainly appears to be some thought that things will revert to “normal.” But there are additional steps that need to be taken in today's environment in case that is an incorrect view. \nQ: What are those steps? \nJE: One strategy for managing interest expense on a short-term basis can be traditional cash-flow hedging, in which variable rate risks are managed through a combination of pay-fixed interest-rate swaps or interest-rate options. For businesses that are more reliant on public bond markets, instruments such as forward-starting swaps and options on swaps, or “swaptions,” may eliminate volatility and potential price risk. \nQ: Can you give an example of how that works?\nJE: A company may have 100% exposure to the Term Loan A, pro rata, or institutional loan market. Those credit facilities are 100% variable in nature. Therefore, on issuance of those types of debt facilities, a company has exposure to short-term rates going forward. Most balance sheets do not support adding concentrated risk on either end of the spectrum—100% floating or 100% fixed. So implementing a paid fixed interest rate swap can provide a more neutral balance. If you can do 50% fixed and 50% floating, or something in that range, it’s a more prudent strategy. \nQ: How should a company evaluate an effective hedging strategy? \nJE: Each scenario is different. It depends on the cyclicality of a business and capacity on the balance sheet for absorbing interest-rate risk. Once a company identifies the interest rate factors affecting their business, the next step is to determine the appropriate strategy to mitigate rate volatility over time. But it’s important to remember that these strategies should be developed independent of market conditions. That can be difficult to remember in the current environment, but managing rate risk and financial risk should not be a reactionary response to market conditions. \nQ: How can this help create cash-flow certainty? \nJE: With hedging, you are effectively mitigating volatility by locking in either an interest rate or a nominal amount of a hedge through a specific duration of that underlying transaction. That essentially creates certainty around free cash-flow generation. So hedging is a prudent strategy for reducing financial market risk, and it can be an important component of a broader risk management strategy. \nQ: Why should companies optimize their risk management strategy?\nJE: Having a disciplined, targeted approach to hedging and in managing the specific funding mix for the balance sheet over time is essential. You can't necessarily predict or navigate around what the debt markets will bring. But you can provide some certainty in terms of preservation of economic value, specifically around interest rate, risk, and volatility. Prudent risk managers should focus on developing an internal framework and risk management policy, independent of market conditions, which focuses on: \nQuantifying exposures and understanding their risk tolerance\nDefining risk management objectives and evaluating alternatives\nFormally documenting their hedge policy and obtaining internal approvals that are required to move forward with their strategic objectives\nWorking with relationship banks to address pre-trade documentation, credit-limit capacity and regulatory requirements that are needed to implement their strategy. \nTo learn more about our derivatives and hedging capabilities, click here.\nDisclaimers & disclosures\nThis material has been prepared by the Sales and Trading Personnel at Capital One, N.A., its affiliates or subsidiaries (“Capital One”) with responsibilities for marketing and sale of swaps and other derivatives.

  "text": "Capital One's Kristen Croxton explains that, in this market, creativity is key to financing your next deal. \nAugust 16, 2023 |4 min read\nFor the past 2 years, apartment complexes and other multifamily properties were among the most attractive investments in commercial real estate. But higher interest rates have curtailed demand for multifamily properties. \nMultifamily real estate is any residential building with 5 or more units covered by a single deed. In the past few years, the demand for multifamily properties rose as work-from-home policies drove demand. In addition, supply chain disruptions limited construction materials, reducing the number of new units coming on the market and driving up rental revenue.\nDespite the challenging environment, many sellers are still expecting a premium similar to what they could have received a year or 2 ago. That’s led to a disconnect between the prices sellers will accept for their properties and what buyers are willing to pay. \nInterest rates touched historic lows during the COVID-19 pandemic, then began rising in 2022 as the Federal Reserve increased the benchmark interest rate to combat inflation. Interest on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.2% in October, and by late spring 2023 it had fallen back to about 3.5% before rising to 4% in mid-July. Multifamily lending rates, which typically move in tandem with Treasuries, have remained in the 5.5% to 6% range for a 10-year product, said Kristen Croxton, senior vice president for loan originations at Capital One Agency Finance.\n“It’s been very challenging to predict where rates are going to at any given time,” Croxton said during a Commercial Real Estate Women’s Network webinar in April. “As recently as last year, people were expecting to buy at rates of 3% or 3.5% and now they’re at 5.5% or 6%, and that has a big impact on the ability to buy.” \nHigher rates affect the loan amounts that buyers can support, and as a result, their deals may require that they provide more equity. At the same time, many sellers have not adjusted their asking prices.\n“There’s a breakdown between buyers and sellers as to what is real value,” Croxton said.\nHigher rates take a toll \nBy the start of this year, higher interest rates were taking a significant toll. First quarter sales fell 74 percent compared with the year prior. \nThe higher rates have also affected interest rate caps, which buyers use to hedge against rising rates. Caps are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a broad measure of short-term borrowing costs. SOFR is used to set a strike price for caps over a period of years. For example, a 2-year cap with a 3% strike will pay if SOFR exceeds 3% over the next 2 years.\nEighteen months ago, borrowers could buy a 2-year cap with 3% strike on a $20 million deal for 9 basis points. By July 2023, the price had risen to 376.8 basis points. As a result, buyers who purchased caps 2 years ago are finding them much more expensive to renew. \n“If you’re assuming a $20 million deal, that [two-year cap 18 months ago] was about $18,000,” Croxton said. “Today, your $18,000 cost went up to $754,000.” \nWhile the caps can provide some protection for buyers in the short term, lenders typically assess escrow requirements semi-annually or annually. As escrow demands increase, buyers face a double hit. \n“Interest-rate caps are putting a ton of pressure on cash flow. Escrow requirements are increasing, and so are mortgage payments because of floating rates,” Croxton said. \nThe result can hurt cash flow from the property. Fortunately for buyers, rents in most markets remain strong. But expenses such as insurance can be more challenging in some markets, she said.\nNew information for sellers \nAll these factors may force some institutional investors to sell properties as the uncertain economic outlook is driving an increase in requests from fund investors to withdraw cash. \nBecause interest rates were low for so long—and interest rate caps were stable—sellers don’t yet have a clear picture of what’s happening in the market. As more data comes out, sellers may adjust their prices, which could lead to more deals, Croxton said. “Sellers will start to understand where the current value of their asset sits,” she said. “And they may bring it to market and have buyers that can buy the asset at that level.” \nWhile lower interest rates would help restore some of the lost luster to the multifamily market, the Fed raised benchmark rates another 25 basis points in July 2023—to their highest in 22 years. \nDespite the uncertain economic outlook, delinquencies on multifamily loans remain little changed, Croxton said. As of March 2023, delinquencies tracked by Fannie Mae were 0.13%, while those for Freddie Mac were at 0.35%. \nBuyers seeking financing for multifamily investments still have options. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been able to offer competitive loans despite rising interest rates, in some cases through favorable loan terms. Early rate lock programs can reduce interest-rate volatility by mitigating the risk that rates will increase during the underwriting process.\nThe two agencies also have programs that offer more favorable terms for properties that install green-energy installations or support affordable housing.\nWhile the uncertainty of interest rates continues to impact the multifamily market, buyers that know where to look can find the right loan programs for their needs and continue to reap the benefits of multifamily real estate investments. \nRelated Content\nArticle | January 6, 2023 \nArticle | November 7, 2022 \n|8 min read",

  "text": "August 16, 2023 |2 min read\nCapital One successfully provided investment funding for the much-needed expansion of a local early childhood development center in Evanston, Wyoming. The project was fostered in partnership with local institutions, regional nonprofits and public funding to bolster resources for a vulnerable community.\nThe U.S. Department of Treasury oversees a federal initiative called the New Markets Tax Credit Program (NMTC). Launched in 2000, the NMTC program helps spur growth among low-income communities across the United States by incentivizing capital investment. It offers tax credits to investors in exchange for support of vital projects that benefit local communities. It has since distributed more than $100 million in local investments in Wyoming and created more than 1,000 new jobs via initiatives like Northern Arapaho Tribe’s Wind River Cares Clinic and Red Wolf Child Care Center in Riverton. \nIn Evanston, the Evanston Childhood Development Center (ECDC) was overburdened—its preschool and childcare offerings operating at capacity for several years running. Serving 500 mostly low-income children, it had recently raised phase one funds to move out of a temporary facility into something more permanent. However, even after scaling back the project, it still fell short of achieving its phase two goals.\nWith help from Capital One and MoFi, a regional nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), ECDC will add 7,049-square-feet to the new first phase building. Local residents with infants to children up to 5 years old will now have 100 new childcare spots for essential care. The financing will also bring approximately 25 new jobs to the city, many of which are expected to be filled by single parents.\nMoFi worked with local leaders to identify the project as an opportunity to make a major positive impact on a community in need. Capital One invested in the tax credits from MoFi, thereby helping to fund a second phase of ECDC, enabling it to maintain and expand services.\nTo learn more about Capital One and our commitments to NMTC investments, click here.",

  "text": "As a C-Suite executive, you likely understand all too well the risk of relying on one or only a few suppliers for vital goods and services. If a supplier experiences delays in fulfilling an order, it can cause serious disruptions throughout your company—affecting both performance and profits. The need to find alternate sources for essential products has never been more urgent than it is today. That's why understanding how to diversify your supplier base is crucial to helping reduce risk and improving overall success and profitability in the long term. \nIn this blog post, we'll explore 6 strategies to diversifying your supplier family. These tips may help your business ensure product quality, reduce costs and gain new perspectives toward reaching a wider range of customers. \n1. Understand your current suppliers and their strengths/weaknesses\nUnderstanding your current suppliers and their strengths and weaknesses is an essential step for any business looking to diversify its supplier base. Keep track of the reliability and quality provided by any current suppliers so you can create a benchmark for choosing new ones. Knowing what your current suppliers bring to the table in terms of quality, cost, production time, customer service and other key criteria also helps identify areas where diversity can add value and complement existing capabilities. \n2. Identify market trends in terms of materials and services\nStaying ahead of current market trends is an important part of diversifying your supplier base and keeping your business competitive. Knowing what materials and services are currently in demand, as well as anticipating future needs, will help you determine which suppliers to engage with and how best to allocate resources. Actively monitor the market, so you can stay aware of any changes that may require your business to adjust or modify your suppliers or processes. This will help streamline your operations while also improving efficiency, quality and cost management.\n3. Establish criteria for evaluating potential suppliers \nWhen selecting potential suppliers, it's imperative to go through an evaluation process. Having pre-defined criteria that highlight what you're looking for in a supplier will aid you in selecting the appropriate one. Be thorough in assessing whether a supplier is right for you, including factors like delivery quality, ability to reduce overhead costs and financial stability. Additionally, vary your criteria across different departments, if needed. This will ultimately lead to more effective decision making. \n4. Develop an approach to onboard new suppliers \nDeveloping a streamlined onboarding process can bring many advantages, from faster timeline execution to better cost management. To ensure there is a streamlined approach, your business should create a workflow that establishes key steps and responsibilities for the onboarding process. This checklist will provide team members with guidance, clear expectations and adequate resources to onboard new suppliers. Following this method can also help you create productive relationships from the beginning. \n5. Monitor performance and incorporate feedback from existing suppliers\nAn essential part of managing any supplier base is periodically monitoring performance and identifying any areas for improvement. Your business should incorporate this feedback into their operations to ensure that the best-suited suppliers are actively engaged in the procurement process. Doing so can increase your competitiveness in sourcing quality goods and services at scale.\n6. Create a supplier diversity program to empower small and underrepresented suppliers\nWhen choosing new suppliers, it’s important to ensure they’re diverse in ownership, staff and perspectives, too. A supplier diversity program will help your business use more small, local and minority-owned suppliers. In doing so, your business will not only support the communities from which the suppliers originate, but also expand your audience and customer base. Additionally, the generally smaller size of these suppliers often allows them to be more nimble, innovative and willing to adapt to change. This will give your business an advantage should there be a shift in the marketplace or your procurement needs. \nAdopting a strategy of supplier diversification can help ensure stability, competitive pricing and innovation. With an understanding of current suppliers and market trends, intelligent criteria for evaluating potential suppliers and a streamlined onboarding process, you can build a robust supplier base tailored to your needs across industries. Stay ahead by thinking strategically about diversifying your supplier base and implementing one or all these tactics into your business processes.",

  "text": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and automation has already started to change the way businesses operate. But how exactly do these tools work, and how can businesses like yours leverage them to create additional value and efficiency? \nRead on to learn more about AI, ML and automation, how businesses are using them to enhance processes and how your business can implement this technology in an effective, responsible way. \nWhat are AI, machine learning and automation? \nSimply put, artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of software that’s designed to simulate human thinking. It uses algorithms to analyze data and make decisions based on that data. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that focuses on giving computers the ability to learn from data without being programmed to do so. Machine learning also uses algorithms to identify patterns in data, which are then used to make predictions and decisions. \nAutomation—the use of technology to perform repetitive tasks—can be used in combination with AI and machine learning. Automation technologies often follow pre-programmed rules to automate tasks, minimizing the need for human input or intervention.\nHow businesses are leveraging AI and machine learning today \nAround the world, businesses are using automation technology to serve a vast number of purposes, from fraud detection to image recognition to predictive analytics. Understanding these common use cases can not only help your business discover new opportunities within your own processes, but also help you keep up in your current marketplace. \nThough the uses for AI and machine learning vary by industry, business size and goal, many use cases fall under three categories: \nEnhancing customer service\nAs you know, customer satisfaction is crucial to the success of every business. AI and machine learning can help streamline your customer service channels, including automated phone trees, chatbots and more. Many businesses also use data-driven AI to better understand their customers and deliver more personalized experiences across different touchpoints.\nIncreasing efficiency\nOne of the most common uses for automation technology is to increase efficiency. Because automation reduces the need for human intervention, integrating AI/ML into simple or repetitive processes has allowed businesses to allocate their staff to higher-value tasks. In industries like manufacturing, automation can help eliminate waste, optimize resources and reduce production times. Some businesses are also beginning to use AI to generate first drafts or outlines of content, which allows more time for ideation, collaboration and creative thinking. \nImproving cost savings\nFor many businesses, cost savings is the primary motivation behind integrating AI and machine learning. This can be achieved by increasing efficiency, as mentioned above, or even increasing their output of a product or service. Another way that businesses are reducing cost is through advancements in fraud detection. With the help of machine learning, companies are able to detect fraudulent activity faster and more accurately, significantly reducing financial losses. \nOther ways AI and machine learning can help create value for your business \nAutomation is quickly becoming a tool that’s used across industries and the world. But beyond just increasing efficiency, how can using AI and machine learning translate to increased value for your business? \nIn addition to saving time and money, the use of automation technology can also be a valuable way to build customer relationships. AI and machine learning can help your business interact more closely with customers and learn about their preferences. With this insight, you can further customize the user experience, which may lead to increased sales opportunities and help you towards building customer loyalty.\nAnother way AI and machine learning can create value is through predictive analytics. This tool can help your business anticipate future trends, so you can make informed decisions about business strategies and position yourself competitively in your marketplace moving forward. \nOpportunities and challenges of AI\nAs companies within the TMT sector increasingly integrate AI into their businesses, opportunities continue to grow. But there are also challenges, risks and complexities that companies in this industry are facing as well. \nContent generation, for example, is one area where AI is already causing significant disruption. These tools can assist in generating personalized content for marketing, advertising or entertainment. But there is also the potential for biased or misleading content. This is because large language models, while incredibly powerful, can inadvertently generate content based on incorrect or prejudiced information. Biased content can also find its way into other applications, like chatbots, as well.\nEnsuring that the content developed with AI tools is free of harmful biases is essential, and businesses in the TMT sector appear to address these concerns proactively as they further expand automation tools. Companies like Google and IBM, for example, do so by supporting responsible, ethical approaches to AI development and usage. \nBalancing the need for efficiency and innovation with the potential social consequences of AI implementation is a crucial aspect of responsible AI adoption, regardless of the industry it’s deployed in. But by embracing these technologies responsibly and strategically, businesses in the TMT sector and beyond can create positive impact and value throughout their business.\nBest practices for implementing automation technologies into your business processes \nAs automation technology continues to advance, it’s important to follow best practices when implementing AI and machine learning:\n1. Start small\nA general rule of thumb is to always start small and expand gradually. This will allow your business to thoroughly test the technology and make adjustments before incorporating any automation into a larger process. \n2. Keep everyone in the know\nIt’s critical that your business involves all relevant departments and employees when planning new AI or machine learning usages. This will ensure that everyone understands the role of these technologies, so they can take advantage of and fully utilize the benefits they offer. \n3. Evaluate and make adjustments\nOnce implemented, it’s important to regularly evaluate and adjust the automation process to ensure it continues to meet the needs of your business. And because AI and machine learning are constantly evolving, your business should regularly examine the latest updates available, advancements in best practices and any updated usage guidance. \n4. Prioritize risk-management and responsibility\nIn general, businesses should strive to build and deploy AI and machine learning responsibly. It’s encouraged for all businesses to approach the use of emerging technology in a way that prioritizes risk management and puts people first. \nAI, machine learning and automation in a nutshell \nThere are many benefits that businesses can gain from AI, machine learning and automation. By utilizing some of the best practices for implementation, your business can more effectively leverage these tools within your current ways of working. And by keeping in mind the limitations and ever-growing advancements of this technology, you can help position your business competitively today and in the future.",

  "text": "July 19, 2023 |5 min read\nWhether you manage a small grassroots operation or a large charitable organization, nonprofits need to conduct a wellness check to ensure stable financials and streamline operations. Because of the rise of various fraud schemes targeting nonprofits over the last several years, organizations are placing a stronger emphasis this year on implementing developed financial management controls to streamline operations and improve organizational security. \nThis article offers five tips for nonprofit financial management so you feel prepared and empowered when conducting a financial wellness check.\n1. Educate teammates on fraud \nDue to both its high reliance on volunteer employees and different internal controls than regulated organizations, the nonprofit sector is estimated to lose approximately $4.5 trillion each year to various fraud schemes. The most common types impacting nonprofits include:\nBusiness email compromise (BEC) scams: Cybercriminals gain access to company records via fraudulent emails posing as a trusted partner.\nACH Payment fraud: Cybercriminals use stolen account information to complete an unauthorized ACH transaction into their private account.\nEndorsement fraud: A signature is forged on a stolen/counterfeit check.\nCredit card fraud: Cybercriminals make small donations with stolen cards to test their validity for other purchases, causing chargeback fees to the organization.\nIt should be noted that banking solutions cannot prevent fraud from happening; having the right support, however, can help mitigate the potential circumstances that arise from fraud when detected. Nonetheless, nonprofits seeking to reduce the impact of fraud in the coming year can reference this guide to educate employees on how to spot these scams, as well as several others and how to help protect the organization when they do. \n2. Streamline the payment process \nRather than donations themselves, membership often forms the financial foundation for most nonprofits, the top performers prioritize a positive donation experience for their members. This approach not only increases the likelihood of potential members making a contribution but can also lead to a larger donation amount than initially intended.\nWith that in mind, nonprofits should make the following adjustments to their payment process: \nSimplify your organization's payments: Look for opportunities to remove paper from your processes and use streamlined electronic transactions wherever possible. This will help your organization stay organized, save time and money and avoid possible postal system delays. \nOptimize for devices: Ensure your site is navigable on web and mobile devices to meet the needs of various member types.\nConsult with banking associates: Collaborate with your bank to ensure that they are offering all of the needed payment options to members/members. \n3. Leverage technology \nTechnology can help empower nonprofits to optimize operations, enhance financial systems and unlock efficiencies. By updating financial systems and integrating enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, nonprofits can:\nAutomate tasks: ERP systems are designed to automate menial everyday tasks such as inventory management, procurement, finance, accounting and marketing. This helps reduce the liability for human error or manipulation in these systems and keeps data updated more consistently than it would be through human means. \nImprove accuracy: Because ERPs collect financial data in one place, they help reduce the need for excessive compiling or transferring of data across systems. This is especially helpful for non-profits often working with systems that do not easily communicate with each other.\nMaximize resource utilization: ERPs automatically budget and report on systems they control, allowing non-profits to quickly assess what resources are and aren’t being used. This helps them make crucial decisions about member benefits, payroll and event planning without having to switch between various systems.\nModern systems offer real-time insights for better decision-making, budget tracking and transparent expense management. Integration of ERPs centralizes functions, streamlines workflows, eliminates data silos and enables efficient collaboration. \nLeveraging technology can engage members, volunteers and stakeholders through online platforms, social media and mobile apps. It enhances reach, member relationships, impact measurement, transparency and accountability.\n4. Prioritize business resiliency planning \nBecause budgets at nonprofits are typically limited, it’s critical for your organization’s health to ensure that you are prepared for unexpected events that may cause unforeseen strain. It’s critical that organizations make backup plans so that your organization is prepared for setbacks in the future. Consider the following:\nExamine your payroll structure: Ensuring that your vendors, employees and paid volunteers receive payment on time is a critical element of staying afloat through tenuous economic conditions. Companies should ensure that their payroll and other internal systems are capable of being run both in-office and remotely to ensure that payments can be made regardless of the external conditions.\nEvaluate your organization's cash flow: Liquidity plays a crucial role during economic downturns. Having sufficient liquidity enables organizations to respond swiftly to changing market conditions, reallocate assets and adjust funding as needed. This adaptability can help them navigate economic challenges more effectively. \nFocus on adaptability: Hold a regular meeting to evaluate your company’s preparedness for changing environments (e.g., natural disasters, public relations crises) to assess potential weak points. Consider aspects like company culture, historical financial strength and the level of debt the organization carries.\nFor nonprofits seeking advice on how to start this process, this resource has specific tips for building resilience into existing processes.\n5. Pay attention to finance system hygiene \nIt’s a less glamorous aspect of performing a wellness check, but I’s must be dotted and T’s crossed. Nonprofits run through a great deal of paperwork pertaining to members, vendors and employees which need to be properly organized and secured. We recommend the following checklist items:\nExamine your contacts: Review your list of vendors and members to eliminate redundancies or outdated records. \nEliminate previously authorized backdoors into your nonprofit: Delete company profiles, access accounts and security clearance for employees who are no longer with your organization.\nChange your passwords: Update your organization’s passwords and set procedures to have them regularly changed moving forward. \nImplementing nonprofit financial management practices for your organization \nExecuting nonprofit financial management practices in the real world is a difficult practice and it’s made all the more difficult when done alone. Between navigating the administrative difficulties of coordinating events and recruiting volunteers, nonprofits manage this noble work on what are often shoestring budgets that make success difficult and the risk of failure even greater. In the middle of that fight, it’s good to have someone in your corner.\nTo learn how Capital One Commercial Bank can help your business, click here.",

  "text": "Uncollected/held funds. We reserve the right to return and/or refuse to pay any check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal or other electronic item or instruction which is presented for payment against uncollected/held funds. If you have a commercial account, a fee may be deducted from the account for any item drawing against uncollected funds, whether the item is paid or returned unpaid, in accordance with our current Schedule of Fees and Charges.\nReturning items for insufficient funds. You do not have the right to write a check or draft, to make an ATM or other withdrawal, or to initiate or have an automatic debit processed against your account for an amount that exceeds your available balance (If you’re enrolled in an overdraft protection, we’ll transfer available amounts to cover the transaction in accordance with the agreement governing your overdraft protection plan). At any time before final payment (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) we may return any check, draft, image, negotiable order of withdrawal, electronic debit or other item presented for payment against your account when there are insufficient available funds in your account to pay the item or if for some other reason the item is not good or payable. In addition, we may charge a fee for each item returned in accordance with our current Schedule of Fees and Charges.\nOverdrafts. This section applies to consumer accounts. Business-purpose accounts may have different policies.\nWhat is an overdraft?\nAn overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a debit transaction, but we pay it anyway. Debit transactions include your checks, Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, bill payments, regularly scheduled repeating payments (like your mortgage or car payment) and other withdrawals you make.\nWhat overdraft services do we offer?\nFor all checking accounts, we will consider paying your checks, ACH (such as your mortgage payment), bill payments, withdrawals and recurring debit card transactions (like your monthly gym payment) into overdraft rather than returning the item unpaid.\nWe also offer an additional overdraft service that you can opt into. If you opt into this service we will also consider paying your everyday one-time debit card and ATM transactions.\nYou can also ask us to generally decline all transactions that would take your account into overdraft.\nRegardless of the overdraft service you have, sometimes we are required to pay a transaction that may create an overdraft in your account. Here are two examples of when this could happen:\nFor example, some merchants, like restaurants, hotels or gas stations—won’t know the exact amount of your purchase when they request the authorization. That transaction could come in for more money and we would need to pay it even if you don't have enough money in your account.\nOr sometimes we authorize a debit card purchase when you have funds in your account, but if the merchant does not submit it for payment right away, another transaction could come in first (while the original debit card purchase transaction is still pending). Then when that debit card transaction comes in for payment there are no longer enough funds in your account to cover it and the payment makes your balance negative.\nIn either case, you still won’t be charged a fee.\nYou can avoid overdrafts on your account by always making sure that you have sufficient funds in your account to cover all the transactions presented for payment.\nHow do we handle overdraft items?\nYou have no right to overdraw your account at any time, for any reason, and our decision to pay overdraft transactions is solely within our discretion. We may refuse to pay an overdraft transaction at any time, even though we may have previously paid overdrafts. If we choose to pay a transaction into overdraft, you must make a deposit into your account to cover the overdrawn amount. We will send you a notice to let you know that your account is overdrawn. You will receive the notice via mail if you have not agreed to receive electronic communications or if you have not provided us with a valid email address.\nWhen deciding to pay transactions that cause an overdraft, we consider a variety of factors, including the amount of the transaction and/or your history with us, including whether you’ve previously had too many overdrafts on your account(s).\nWhat else do you need to know?\nMaintaining a negative balance in your account for 56 consecutive calendar days will result in account closure and this could affect your ability to open new accounts with us or other banks in the future. Also, we may report the account closure to a consumer reporting agency.\nStop payment orders. You or any one of the signers on your account may request us to stop payment on a check written on your account by providing us with the account number and the check number or check range. You understand that unless we have complete and accurate information from you, we may be unable to identify the check for which a stop payment has been requested which will result in the check being paid. We also require a reasonable amount of time to act on the request. If two or more signatures are required to transact business, we may accept any ONE authorized signature for a stop payment order.\nUnder certain circumstances, current transaction information may not be available, and the item upon which a stop payment has been requested may already have been paid. If the item upon which you have stopped payment has already been paid, we will refund the stop payment fee at your request. Written stop payment orders expire after six (6) months. All stop payment orders entered by you through Teleservice24℠ expire six months from the date entered unless otherwise renewed by you in writing before they expire.\nUnless stop payment orders are renewed in writing, Capital One Bank assumes no responsibility if the item is paid after the expiration of the stop payment order. You will be charged a fee for initial and renewed stop payment orders.\nYou may not stop payment on a check that is used to purchase a Cashier’s Check, on the purchased Cashier’s Check (except as otherwise provided by applicable law), or on any item that has already cleared or has been paid.\nAutomated processing. In accordance with general banking standards, we have adopted automated collection and payment systems which rely on information encoded onto each check in magnetic ink. You agree that we may disregard all information on any check drawn on your account (front and back) other than your signature, the amount of the check and the information encoded in magnetic ink. You further agree that we shall not be deemed to have failed to exercise ordinary care in paying an item solely because our procedures do not require us to perform a sight examination of items with a face amount below a threshold level established by us from time to time.\nPost-dated checks. If you write a post-dated check, we may pay it and charge it against your account, even if it is presented prior to the date of the check.\nStale Checks. We are not obligated to pay a check presented for payment more than six months after its date (a “Stale Check”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree to hold us harmless if we pay a Stale Check. If you do not want us to pay a Stale Check, you must place a stop-payment order on the check.\nRestrictive legends. We are not required to honor any restrictive legend placed on checks you write. Examples of restrictive legends placed on checks are “must be presented within 90 days” or “not valid for more than $1000.00”. We are not responsible for any losses, claims, damages, or expenses that result from your placement of these or other special instructions on your checks.\nDrafts which do not bear your signature. If we receive a draft drawn against your account which does not contain your signature as reflected on the signature card for your account we may, at our discretion, return the draft unpaid. If you wish to ensure that a draft drawn against your account but not bearing your signature will be paid, you must communicate to us in advance that you want the draft to be paid.\nFacsimile signature/system-generated signatures. If you authorize us to honor any facsimile or system-generated signature, you have the sole responsibility for maintaining the security of each signature affixing device or system. No facsimile or system-generated signature shall be deemed to be an unauthorized signature notwithstanding the lack of authority of the person(s) affixing such signature, and you shall be solely responsible for any and all losses incurred in connection with the use of the facsimile or system-generated signature.\nChecks presented over the counter for payment by a non-customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that if a check drawn against your account is presented over-the-counter for payment by a person who is not a deposit customer of Capital One Bank we may, in our sole discretion, refuse payment of the check or charge a fee for payment of the check.\nPower of attorney. Power of attorney is a legal arrangement in which a person (the principal), authorizes another person (the agent/ attorney(s)-in-fact) to act on his or her behalf with respect to certain matters. Such matters may include banking, retirement benefits, real estate, insurance, and other transactions. If you want someone other than an authorized signer on your account to transact business on your account, you must provide us with a form reasonably acceptable to us which identifies the person to whom you grant your power of attorney and each account for which you wish the agent to exercise the power of attorney.\nWe have no duty or agreement whatsoever to monitor or insure that the acts of the agent are for your benefit. We may continue to honor the transactions of the agent until: (a) we have received written notice or have actual knowledge of the termination of the authority or the death of the principal, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice or knowledge. You agree not to hold us responsible for any loss or damage you may incur as a result of our following instructions given by an agent acting under a valid power of attorney.\nDeath or incompetence. If any person with a right to withdraw funds from your account(s) dies or becomes legally incompetent, we must be promptly notified. We may continue to honor your checks, items and instructions until (a) we know of your death or legal incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that we may pay checks drawn on or before the date of death or legal incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming interest in the account. We may restrict access to your account upon notice of your death or legal incompetence until the appropriate documentation is provided to us by your executor, administrator or other legal representative of your estate or person.\nGrant of security interest and right to set-off. To secure payment of any monies that you may owe us or any of our affiliates, for any reason, you grant us a continuing security interest in all funds that you may now and in the future maintain on deposit with us, with the exception of funds held in a trust or fiduciary account, or in an Individual Retirement Account, or in other qualified tax-deferred accounts. You agree that we may apply (set-off) funds that you maintain on deposit with Capital One Bank, or any of its affiliates, against any amount that you may then owe us, or any of our affiliates, under a loan, or Overdraft, or guaranty, or for any other reason at any time and without prior notice to you. This right of set off does not apply if the debt is created under a consumer credit card plan. We may set-off your account at any time whether or not you are then in default in making payment to us, and we may exercise our right of set-off without liability to you even if it results in an interest penalty or dishonor of subsequent checks and other items with respect to your account. You further agree that the foregoing right extends to any federal or state benefit payments (including Social Security benefits) electronically deposited into your account. You understand and agree that if you do not want your benefits to be subject to our right of set-off, you may change your direct deposit instructions by providing notice to the benefits payor at any time. You also agree that any federal benefits or other payments deposited to your account after you are no longer eligible to receive benefits must be returned to the federal government or other payor, and we may set-off against any of your accounts if we are obligated to return funds to the payor. Our right to set-off your account is in addition to any other rights and remedies that we may have under law or under any other contractual agreement.\nCollection expenses. You agree to pay and reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses in attempting to collect amounts that you owe us arising out of transactions on your account. This includes payment and reimbursement of fees we incur for collecting such amounts, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees (including our in-house attorneys) and court costs.\nAdverse claims. If we receive conflicting instructions with respect to your account, or notice of an adverse claim of ownership, right to control, or access to funds in your account, or notice that the funds in your account may have been obtained through fraudulent or criminal acts, you agree that if any such dispute exists, we may place a hold on the funds in your account and refuse to honor all withdrawal and transfer requests, including checks written on the account, until all appropriate parties provide us with joint specific written instructions with respect to disposition of the funds. We are not required to determine whether a dispute has merit. Additionally, we shall have the right to close the account and deposit the funds held in the account into the registry of a court of proper jurisdiction, wherein the adverse claimants and/or appropriate parties shall be interpleaded and/or joined to the action for purposes of resolving the dispute regarding the funds. If we elect to take any action(s) described herein, you agree that we shall not be liable to you for damages of any kind, and you agree to pay and reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees (including our in-house attorneys) and court costs from the funds in the account prior to any distribution. If an adverse claim is made among joint depositors, the rights of the parties shall be determined in accordance with the section herein entitled Special Rules for Multiple Party Deposit Accounts.\nLegal process against account. If your account is attached, garnished, or otherwise subject to levy or seizure, in whole or in part, by legal action, we shall not be liable to you for any sums we may be required to pay because of such attachment, garnishment, levy or seizure, even if paying the money from your account leaves insufficient funds to pay a check you have written. We can restrain your account regardless of the location of the account and the location of service. For example, if a New York levy is properly served on us in New York, we may honor the New York levy even if your account was opened in Virginia. You hereby authorize us to comply with legal process, and we are not required to determine whether the court issuing the legal process had jurisdiction over you or over the account or otherwise had the authority to issue the legal process. If we incur any expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney fees, in responding to an attachment, garnishment, levy, or seizure that are not otherwise reimbursed, we may charge such expenses to your account without prior notice to you. Any such attachment, garnishment, levy or seizure is subject to our right of offset. If we are served with a notice of proceeding relating to a safe deposit box, and you are not a named defendant in the proceeding, we may deny you access to the box unless otherwise directed by an appropriate court or the judgment creditor.\nUnclaimed property. The law establishes procedures under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable State. The applicable State is usually the State listed in the address on your account statement. Generally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your account over a period of years. If your funds are surrendered to the State, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim must be presented to the State. Once your funds are surrendered, we no longer have any liability or responsibility with respect to the funds.\nClosing an account. We may close any account in our sole discretion at any time, for any or no reason and without notice to you. For example, we may close your account with no notice of action if the account has a zero balance. If we close your account with a balance, we will notify you of our action and either transfer the funds to another internal account owned by you or an external account through an approved link or send you a check for the collected balance in your account, less any amounts due to us for pending transactions. Capital One Bank is not liable for any damages or liabilities resulting from the termination of an account relationship. Subject to any rights we may have with respect to advance notice of withdrawal from your account, you may close your account at any time and for any reason. If we receive a debit or credit to your closed account, the account may be reopened to accept the debit or credit for you, even if doing so overdraws your account, and funds deposited therein will be subject to any and all rights we may have with respect to offset. If your account is overdrawn when we close it, you agree to promptly pay all amounts owed to us.\nMinor accounts. We may pay funds on deposit in an account in the name of a minor to the minor. Once the minor attains the age of majority he or she will be considered to be the owner of the account, capable of making any and all transactions on the account.\nBusiness accounts. If the account owner is not a natural person, such as a corporation, unincorporated association, limited liability company, partnership or any other entity holding an account in any capacity other than an individual capacity, and as may be required by Capital One Bank for the specific deposit account, each person who signs the signature card hereby certifies that they are fully authorized to execute all documents in their stated capacity. Additionally, and where applicable as set forth above, the individual who signs the signature card as Secretary hereby certifies that (1) she/he is the duly qualified Secretary or other authorized officer of the business entity identified on the signature card as the account holder; (2) such business entity is organized and existing under state or federal law; (3) all actions by shareholders, directors and all others necessary to execute this signature card and establish an account with Capital One Bank have been taken; and, (4) until further actual notice to Capital One Bank, each signer is authorized to transact on the account until Capital One Bank receives actual written notice in a form acceptable to us, executed by the number of Signers required to execute withdrawals on the account, and/or executed by others as required by us, that such Signer is no longer so authorized. To the extent a signature card is required for the specific deposit account, in the event any one or more of the signatures affixed to the front of this signature card, or otherwise provided to Capital One Bank as an authorized signature for the operation of this account, are facsimiles or made or reproduced by any mechanical means, Capital One Bank is authorized to rely upon and treat the same, in good faith, as a true and valid signature, and the account holder hereby holds Capital One Bank harmless and indemnifies it from and against any loss, damage or liability it may suffer or incur as a result of its said reliance.\nMultiple-signer business accounts. We are not required to comply with any multiple-signature requirement, even if your signature card specifies that multiple signatures are required or you have otherwise instructed us to do so. A multiple-signature requirement is for your internal control purposes.\nOnline account consolidation disclosure. If you have more than one eligible Capital One account, we will link your eligible accounts so they appear when you are logged into your account through the website or mobile app. We will display only summary information about your connected accounts. To get any other information or conduct any activity on these account types, you must access the specific account servicing area for that account. All connected bank accounts will be visible when you log into your account through the website or mobile app. Keep in mind that certain features, information, types of transactions, or other services may not be available for all of your connected accounts. As long as you maintain your unique log in credentials, you will have access to view all of your individual accounts and shared accounts. People with whom you share accounts will only be able to view accounts that are shared with you, not your individual accounts.\nPayment processing restrictions on internet gambling fund transfers. The Federal Reserve recently enacted regulations that require U.S. financial firms that participate in designated payment systems to establish and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent payments connected to unlawful Internet gambling. In light of the regulations, please be informed that restricted transactions (as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG / 12 CFR Part 233) are prohibited from being processed directly or indirectly through any account or relationship maintained with us. Restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with unlawful Internet gambling.\nSpecific terms applicable to the following account ownerships\nJoint account – If two or more individuals are designated as owners of the accounts (without a fiduciary, beneficiary or other designation), then the account is a joint account and, unless your signature card states otherwise, all owners are considered to be joint tenants with right of survivorship. If there is more than one joint owner, the rights of survivorship will continue between the surviving joint owners. One joint owner is not authorized to remove another joint owner from the title of the joint account, but may withdraw all of the funds in the account or close the account.\nTrust — An account established pursuant to a written trust agreement. Any funds placed in or added to this type of account are conclusively presumed to be a delivery at that time to the trust estate. Only the trustee is authorized to perform transactions on the trust account. If the original trustee dies or is replaced as trustee, we reserve the right to require documentation reasonably acceptable to us to which identifies the successor trustee. We have no duty whatsoever for enforcing the terms of the trust agreement and can rely on the statements and representations made to us by the trustee. The owners and beneficiaries of the trust agree that we shall not be held liable if the trustee breaches their fiduciary duty or fails to comply with the terms of the trust agreement.\nUniform Transfers to Minors — This type of account is established pursuant to the Uniform Transfers/Gifts to Minors Act in effect in the state where the account is opened and maintained, as may be amended from time to time. Only the Custodian is authorized to act on the account. As the Custodian you agree to comply with all applicable laws. When the minor reaches the age of majority, in accordance with applicable state law, the Custodian shall transfer any funds in the account to the minor. In the event we receive actual notice of the death, resignation or legal incapacity of the Custodian, we are directed to deliver this account to the Successor Custodian (as provided by law) who shall, in such event, have all of the rights and duties of the Custodian.\n“Payable on Death” (POD) – You may designate an individual or joint account to be payable upon your death to a designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. POD accounts are also known as “In Trust For” (ITF)”, “As Trustee For” (ATF), “Transfer on Death” (TOD) or “Totten Trust” account and are governed by applicable state laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for meeting the requirements for establishing your account as a POD, including any titling requirements.\nDuring your life, the funds in the account belong to you and, until your death, or if there are co-owners, upon the death of the last co-owner, the beneficiary(ies) have no interest in the account and cannot perform transactions on the account. You may withdraw all or part of the account balance, close the account, remove or add POD beneficiaries or change the account type or ownership. Upon the death of all owners, we will distribute the then remaining funds to such of the beneficiaries as shall be then-living, in equal shares, subject to our right to charge the account for any amount a deceased owner, co-owner or POD beneficiary owes us; if any beneficiary is under the age of 18 years at the time he would be entitled to receive property under the terms of the previous provision, we will pay such person’s share to any person who is the statutory or court-appointed custodian for the benefit of such person.\nSpecial rules for multiple party deposit accounts\nIf your account was opened or assigned to a branch in New Jersey, the provisions of the Multiple Party Account Act, N.J.S.A. 17:16i-1 et seq. apply.\nWe may treat each co-owner of a joint account as having full and complete authority to make deposits into such account, to request information with respect to such account and to place a hold on such account. Each co-owner owns his/her net contribution to such account. In the absence of proof of net contribution, and unless all of the co-owners have specifically otherwise agreed, each co-owner will own an equal share of such account. We are not required to determine net contributions.\nDeposits: Each co-owner authorizes the other co-owners to endorse for deposit into the account any item payable to any or all of the co-owners, and you expressly authorize us to supply the endorsement of any co-owner necessary for such deposit.\nWithdrawals: \nYou authorize us to recognize the signature, oral or electronic instruction of any co-owner for withdrawals, payments or funds transfer. We are not required to enforce multiple signature requirements that you may have agreed upon among yourselves.\nWe may continue to honor checks and withdrawal requests by any co-owner without liability to any other co-owner unless we receive written notice signed by one of you not to honor checks or withdrawals against the joint account. After we receive such a notice, we may require written authorization from all of you for any checks or withdrawals. If we receive a notice in writing as provided by this section 3(b), we shall be relieved of responsibility to each and every co-owner for failure or refusal to honor any check, draft or other demand for payment or withdrawal unless the action is authorized by all co-owners in writing.\nWithout notice to any party, we may withdraw or hold any or all of the money in the joint account and apply funds withdrawn to reduce any indebtedness of any party due and owing to Capital One Bank. A notice sent, mailed or delivered to any party constitutes notice to all.\nWe may make payment from the joint account, including payment of the entire account balance: (i) pursuant to any statutory or common law right of set-off, levy, attachment, or other valid legal process or court order, relating to the interest of any one or more of the co-owners or (ii) on request, to a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver in any state or federal insolvency proceeding or other duly authorized insolvency representative of any one or more of the co-owners.\nOverdrafts: In the event that we pay a check drawn on a joint account and that payment causes an Overdraft, each party to that joint account will be jointly and severally liable to us for the amount of that Overdraft without regard to which party signed the check or for what purpose the proceeds of the check were used.\nDeath of a party: You agree to notify us of the death of any joint owner and to reimburse us for any tax we must pay by reason of our payment or release of funds in the account to you. Unless your signature card states otherwise, upon the death of any account owner, the funds in a multiple-owner account shall belong to the surviving owner(s). We reserve the right to hold funds in the account until we receive documentation satisfactory to us, proving death and/or directing the disposition of such funds.\nIf you want to change the form of your account, you must notify us in writing, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the branch where your account is maintained. If you wish to alter the form of an account, the altered form must be an account offered by Capital One Bank and written notice must be made by the proper completion of a document approved by Capital One Bank and delivery of that document to us. Written notice is not effective until received by us. You must also provide us with new completed signature cards within thirty (30) days from the date you forwarded written notice to us.\nWe will be protected from liability for all payments made from the multiple party deposit account, when made in accordance with applicable law.\nLimitations on assignment and transfer of ownership. You may not assign or transfer ownership of your deposit accounts with us without obtaining our prior written approval. In addition, you may not grant a security interest in funds held in your deposit accounts in favor of any other creditor without obtaining our prior written approval, which we have the right to withhold for any or no reason. If any ownership interest in an account is proposed to be transferred or if there is any change in account title, we may require that the account be closed and a new account be opened.\nDeposit availability disclosure\nGeneral deposit availability:\nOur general policy is to make funds from your deposits available to you on the first business day after the day we receive your deposits. Wire Transfers, and electronic deposits (such as ACH credit transfer direct deposits) will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once funds are available, you may withdraw the funds in cash, and we will use the funds to pay checks that you have written. For the purpose of determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. Banking office cutoff times may vary, but in no event shall a cutoff time be earlier than 2:00 p.m. local time. If you make a deposit in a branch before 2:00 p.m. local time, or such later time posted at the branch of deposit on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. If you make a deposit at one of our automated teller machines (“ATM”) before 9:00 p.m. ET, we will consider the deposit to be made that day. However, if you make a deposit after these stated times, or on a day we are not open, we will consider the deposit to be made on the next business day that we are open. Deposits made through our night drop after 7:00 a.m. may be processed on the next business day.\nPlease remember that even after we have made deposited funds available to you, and you have withdrawn the funds, you are still responsible for checks you deposit that are returned to us unpaid and for any other problems involving your deposit. If you have any questions, contact a banking officer.\nGovernment checks and cashier’s checks:\nFunds from the following deposits are available on the first business day after the day of your deposit: U.S. Treasury Checks, USPS Money Orders, Federal Reserve Bank & Federal Home Loan Bank checks; and when deposited with a special deposit slip, State or Local government checks, Cashier’s, Certified, Teller’s and Travelers checks.\nLonger delays may apply:\nIn some cases, we will not make all of the funds you deposit by check available to you on the first business day after the day of your deposit. Funds may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. The first $225 of your deposits, however, may be available on the first business day after the day of your deposit. If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first business day, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the day after we receive your deposit.\nIf you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available.\nIn addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:\nWe believe the check you are depositing will not be paid.\nYou deposit checks totaling more than $5,525 on any day to any account(s) you maintain (alone or with others) at Capital One Bank.\nYou redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid.\nYou have overdrawn your account(s) repeatedly in the last six months.\nThere is an emergency, such as failure of computer or communications equipment.\nWe will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. The funds will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.\nSpecial rules for new accounts:\nIf you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first thirty (30) days your account is open:\nFunds from wire transfers and electronic deposits (such as ACH credit transfer direct deposits) will be available on the day we receive the deposit.\nFunds from the following deposits are available on the first business day after the day of your deposit: U.S. Treasury Checks, USPS Money Orders, Federal Reserve Bank & Federal Home Loan Bank checks; and when deposited with a special deposit slip, State or Local government checks, Cashier’s, Certified, Teller’s and Travelers checks.\nFunds from all other check deposits will be available no later than the fifth business day after the day of your deposit.\nExpedited availability:\nBased on your overall relationship with us, we may make a portion of your check deposits available to you on an expedited basis. We will periodically reevaluate the usage and handling of your account based on your customer history with Capital One Bank. This review could result in reducing the availability schedule currently applied to your check deposits. In the event of such a reduction, your funds will be made available to you as described in the preceding sections of this disclosure.\nAs described above, deposits made after the branch and/or ATM cut-off time will be considered next day deposits. In some instances, however, you may be able to access these deposits on the calendar day the deposit was made. In these instances, the funds will be accessible to you for withdrawal (at a branch or ATM), but will not be available to pay incoming ACH transactions or checks you have written.\nHolds on other funds (check cashing):\nIf we cash a check for you that is drawn on another bank, we may withhold the availability of a corresponding amount of funds that are already in your account. (These funds will be available at the time that funds from the check we cashed would have been available if you had deposited the check.)\nHolds on other funds (other accounts):\nIf we accept for deposit a check that is drawn on another bank, we may make funds from the deposit available for withdrawal immediately but delay your availability to withdraw a corresponding amount of funds that you have on deposit in another account with us. The funds in the other account would then not be available for withdrawal until the time periods that are described elsewhere in this disclosure. Please ask a Relationship Banker if you are unsure about when funds from a deposit will be available.\nSubstitute checks and your rights\nFederal rules for Check 21 allow banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks”. Below are the details and your rights:\nWhat is a substitute check?\nTo make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks.” These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check.\nSome or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other law with respect to those transactions.\nWhat are my rights regarding substitute checks?\nIn certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from your account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, bounced check fees).\nThe amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law. If you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business days after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar days after we received your claim.\nWe may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account.\nHow do I make a claim for a refund?\nIf you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact your local branch or call us at 1-800-262-5689. You must contact us within 40 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances.\nYour claim must include:\nA description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect);\nAn estimate of the amount of your loss;\nAn explanation of why the substitute check you received is insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss; and\nA copy of the substitute check and/or the following information to help us identify the substitute check: the account number, the check number, the name of the person to whom you wrote the check, the date paid, and the amount of the check.\nSubstitute checks should only be generated by banks during the check collection process. If you deposit a substitute check that was not generated or previously handled by Capital One Bank, you agree to provide the substitute check warranties as required by Check 21, and represent that the substitute check:\nis properly generated and accurately, clearly and completely represents all the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated\nbears a MICR encoded line that is suitable for automated processing in the same manner as the original check\nhas not previously been paid by the drawee bank, and\nis not fraudulent\nA breach of any Check 21 warranty may result in the substitute check being charged back against your account.\nTelephone solicitation. If you provide our routing number and your account number to a telephone solicitor pursuant to your acceptance of an offer of goods or services made by the solicitor, you agree that any and all subsequent transactions made to your account by the entity which the solicitor represents are considered authorized transactions. We shall not be liable for any transactions you later allege are unauthorized unless you have placed a stop payment order, and we have had a reasonable time to act upon your stop payment request.\nCommunications. You agree that we may communicate with you by mail, telephone, email, fax, prerecorded message, automated voice, text message or other means allowed by law regarding your Account. You agree that we may contact you at any telephone number (including a mobile telephone number that you provide us), and use an automated telephone dialing system or similar device to do so. You agree that we may monitor or record any conversation or other communication with you.\nCorrespondents. Capital One Bank may forward items to correspondent banks and will not be liable for the wrongful conduct of the correspondent bank. Each correspondent will be liable only for its own negligence. We will not be liable for the loss of items in transit.\nAddress changes for deposit accounts governed by this document1. You are responsible for notifying us of any change in your address. Your Privacy and Security is important to us so having the most current address on file is required. Unless we agree otherwise, changes of address must be made online, over the phone, or in a branch by at least one of the account holders. Informing us of your address on a check reorder form is not sufficient. We will attempt to communicate with you only by use of the most recent address you have provided to us. In the event mail we attempt to deliver to you is returned as a result of your failure to notify us of your change in address, we may charge a fee to your account in accordance with our Schedule of Fees and Charges.\nWe may change your postal address of record if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service or if we receive information from a third party vendor in the business of providing correct addresses, that our records no longer correspond to your address.\n1 For example, if you have a line of credit with us or a 360 checking account, please follow the account agreement given to you.\nCash transaction reporting. The law requires all financial institutions to gather and report information on certain types of cash transactions. If the information required to complete the report is not provided, we are required to refuse to process the transaction.\nObtaining credit reports. We may request a consumer (credit) report in connection with your account(s). Upon your request, you will be informed whether or not a consumer (credit) report was requested, and if such report was requested, informed of the name and address of the consumer (credit) reporting agency that furnished the report. We may also request subsequent consumer (credit) reports for all legitimate purposes in connection with updating, renewing, reviewing, modifying, and/or taking collection action on your account(s).\nReporting information to credit bureaus and check verification systems. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus and/or check verification systems. Defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. This could affect your ability to open accounts in the future.\nIn the event we report your account to a check verification system, you acknowledge that even if you pay us all amounts owed, we are not required to remove an accurate report of account mishandling from any such check verification system.\nBusiness day. Any day, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays.\nReproduction of bank records. If you request us to research and/or reproduce any of your records (statements, checks, deposits, withdrawals, etc.) we may charge a fee, and you agree to pay this fee. If the expected fee is large, you may be asked to pay the fee in advance. We reserve the right to provide any account holder with an imaged item in lieu of the original item.\nGoverning law/waiver of jury trial. Applicable federal law will decide any questions under these Rules, or if no federal law exists, applicable state law (the state where your account was established). Any action you commence against us, arising out of or concerning these Rules, shall be heard by a judge sitting without a jury.

We shall deem any and all notices to us effective upon receipt by us. Any notice that we give to you will be effective when mailed or electronically transmitted to you at the mailing/email address reflected in our records. Even though we may have provided you account opening disclosures in a language other than English, we may continue to provide you with notices/communications in English. Notice to any one owner of an account constitutes notice to all owners of that account.\nSeverability. If any provision of these Rules is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Rules or of any agreements, disclosures or other documents incorporated by reference herein.\nLiability. You agree that we shall be not be liable for acting upon your instructions or failing to act upon your instructions when we reasonably believe that doing so would expose us to civil or criminal liability or conflict with industry standard banking practices. You agree further, that except as otherwise provided by applicable law, in no event shall we be liable for indirect, special or consequential damages or for attorney’s fees incurred by you, regardless of the form of the action, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nWaiver of rights. We reserve the right to waive any one or more of our rights hereunder in our sole discretion, however, any such waiver shall only apply to that specific instance. Any such waiver of rights can also be terminated at any time, in our sole discretion.\nCaption headings. The caption headings in these Rules are for convenience purposes only and are not to be construed as a summary of each provision of these Rules.\nPrivacy Policy. We understand how important privacy and confidentiality are to you.

Special provisions relating to electronic funds transfers are set forth in our EFT Disclosure which is available at any of our banking offices.\nWire and ACH transfers. Special provisions relating to wire transfers are set forth in our Wire Transfer Agreement and Disclosure, provided to you at account opening and available at any of our banking offices. For Treasury Management clients, ACH and Wire transfer terms are set forth in the applicable Treasury Management agreements. This provision supplements those agreements. You agree that we are not required to provide you with a separate notice of incoming or outgoing wire/ACH transfers. We notify you by listing the wire/ACH transfer on your account statement. We can deduct our fees for handling wire/ACH transfers from the amount of the transfer. You can verify whether a wire/ACH transfer has been processed to your account by calling us at 1-800-655-2265.\nFor international wire transfers involving non-U.S. currencies, exchange rates can vary and we do not guarantee any rate. The exchange rates we use for your transactions will typically be the customary retail exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction. This rate is not necessarily the bank-to-bank negotiated exchange rate or other potentially more favorable rate. FDIC deposit insurance does not insure against any loss due to foreign currency fluctuations. Consult your attorney or investment advisor regarding the potential risks associated with foreign exchange transactions.\nReal-Time Payments (RTP). You agree that we are not required to provide you with a separate notice of incoming RTP payments. We notify you by listing the RTP payment on your account statement.\nAmendments and fee changes. We reserve the right to change our fees, these Rules and any or all of the agreements, disclosures, and other documents incorporated by reference at any time. If we change these Rules, the then-current version of these Rules supersedes all prior versions and contains the terms governing your account. We will provide prior notice of changes to you as required by applicable law. You agree that continued use of your account(s) will constitute your agreement to any and all new fees, Rules, agreements, disclosures and other documents incorporated by reference. If you choose to close your account and do so prior to the effective date of any amendment, you will not be bound by such amendment.\nCopy received. You acknowledge receipt of a copy of these terms and conditions and agree to be bound by them.\nElectronic Fund Transfer Agreement and disclosure for personal and commercial accounts\nEffective February 9, 2022\nWelcome to Capital One, N.A. (hereinafter referred to as “Capital One Bank,” “us,” “our,” or “we”). In this Agreement, “you,” “your,” and “yours” mean the authorized person or persons who conduct electronic fund transfers, including but not limited to persons to whom a Capital One Bank ATM or Debit Card is issued. Capital One Bank provides various electronic banking services to you. These services include, but are not limited to:\nAutomated Teller Machine (“ATM”) transactions.\nTelephone transfers.\nPoint-of-Sale (“POS”) transactions, whether or not initiated through an electronic terminal.\nPre-authorized transfers to or from an account (“ACH”).\nSmartphone or other mobile device transfers.\nOnline banking (see the Online Banking Terms and Conditions at www.capitalone.com/corporate/terms/).\nThis Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement and Disclosure (“Agreement”) contains disclosures required by Regulation E that apply to consumer accounts in addition to disclosures that apply to commercial accounts as they relate to electronic banking services, and it contains our terms and conditions with respect to these services. A consumer account is an account held by an individual and used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\nYour access device and your Personal Identification Number: An access device is a card, personal identification number (\"PIN\"), or other code used to initiate an electronic fund transfer (\"EFT\") to or from your account. The Capital One Bank, ATM card, platinum Debit Card, or Business Debit Card (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"ATM/Debit Card\") that you have requested is an access device.\nYou have selected or have been provided with a special PIN, a code you must enter into the ATM or that you may be required to enter into the POS terminal whenever you use your ATM/Debit Card. For your own protection, please memorize the PIN, and do not keep any notation of the PIN on the ATM/Debit Card or in the same wallet or purse as the ATM/Debit Card, and do not disclose the PIN to anyone who is not authorized to use your ATM/Debit Card.\nImportant information concerning international use of your ATM or Debit Card: Capital One Bank employs fraud monitoring and protection capabilities to help protect you from ATM/Debit Card fraud. These protection systems are designed to block transactions that occur outside of our customers’ ordinary transaction patterns and may block transactions originating in countries that are experiencing a high incidence of card fraud.\nAccounts that may be accessed: The accounts you link to your ATM/Debit Card are referred to in this Agreement as \"designated accounts.\" You may access only the designated accounts. If you requested access to multiple accounts, you chose one checking account and one savings account as your primary checking and savings accounts. We may limit the number of accounts that can be linked to an ATM/Debit Card. If you wish to access additional accounts or change your primary accounts, please contact your banking officer.\nYou may use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN to access the following types of designated accounts:\nChecking account.\nNOW account.\nSavings account.\nMoney Market account*\n* At certain ATMs, when accessing your Money Market accounts you may need to select the ‘checking’ option rather than the ‘savings’ option.\nTypes of transactions that can be completed: You may use your ATM/Debit Card at any Capital One Bank ATM. You may also use your ATM/Debit Card to complete transactions at non-Capital One Bank ATMs that are members of the EFT networks in which we participate.\nPurchases may also be made using your ATM/Debit Card at merchant locations that are members of the POS networks in which we participate. You may also use your Debit Card or Business Debit Card to make purchases at locations that accept Debit MasterCard™ Cards. (Note: Your Debit Card or your Business Debit Card is not a MasterCard credit card, and this Agreement does not replace or affect any MasterCard account agreement that you may have with us or any other financial institution.)\nPlease note that some of the below services may not be available at all ATMs.\nCash withdrawals: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at ATMs to obtain cash withdrawals from your designated accounts. At certain ATMs, cash withdrawals may only be made from your primary savings and primary checking account. Withdrawals made at ATMs owned and operated by other entities will be automatically deducted from your designated primary checking or savings account. Each time you use your ATM/Debit Card, we may place a hold on a corresponding amount of funds in your account until the transaction is posted against your account.\nDeposits: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at Capital One Bank-branded ATMs to make deposits into your designated accounts. Deposits made at an ATM may not be available for immediate withdrawal. Please refer to the Deposit Availability Disclosure contained in our Rules Governing Deposit Accounts Agreement to determine when the deposit will be credited to your account and when funds will be available for withdrawal or for paying transactions on your account.\nTransfers between your Capital One accounts: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at a Capital One Bank-branded ATM to transfer available funds between your designated accounts. Transfers made at a non-Capital One Bank ATM can only be made between your designated primary checking and primary savings accounts.\nYou may also transfer funds between your Capital One Bank accounts via the telephone, online banking, or by establishing an automatic transfer schedule.\nPurchases: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN to make purchases at merchant locations that are members of POS networks in which we participate.\nYou may also use your ATM/Debit Card without your PIN to make purchases at merchant locations accepting Debit MasterCard Cards. The merchant may request a preauthorization for the transaction. If we authorize the transaction, the funds will be debited from your primary checking account immediately, or a hold may be placed on your account for up to several days after the purchase transaction has occurred, depending upon the promptness with which the merchant processes your transaction.\nSome purchases may result in a longer hold. Sometimes the preauthorization requests may be in amounts different from the total amount of the transaction. For example, a gas station typically requests authorization in the amount of $1.00. Also, restaurants typically request authorization for 20% more than the price of the meal. If the preauthorization request varies from the amount of the actual transaction, payment of the transaction may not remove the preauthorization hold immediately. Generally, the preauthorization hold may remain on your account for up to three (3) business days after the date of the transaction and may affect the availability of funds from your designated account for other transactions. We will not be responsible for damages for wrongful dishonor of an item resulting from a preauthorization hold. You agree not to withdraw, write checks, or make point-of-sale purchases against funds that are needed to pay ATM/Debit Card transactions that have not yet posted against your account.\nInquiries: You can use your ATM/Debit Card and PIN at ATMs to check the balance in your designated accounts. At non-Capital One Bank ATMs, you may only make balance inquiries on your designated primary checking or savings account. You may also check the balance in your designated accounts via our telephone or online banking service.\nTransfers between your Capital One Bank accounts and accounts at other financial institutions (or third parties) and check conversion: You can authorize a third party to initiate transfers between your accounts and the third party’s accounts by providing the third party with our routing number and your account number.\nYou may also authorize a merchant or other payee to make a one-time electronic payment from your checking account using information from your check to: (i) pay for purchases, or (ii) pay bills.\nWhen you provide a check as payment, you authorize us to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account. In certain circumstances, such as for technical or processing reasons, we may process your payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account on the same day you make your payment.\nYou should only provide your financial institution and account information (whether over the phone, the Internet, or via some other method) to trusted third parties whom you have authorized to initiate electronic fund transfers.\nLimitations on Transactions: There are certain limitations on the use of electronic banking services. These include, but are not limited to, the following: \nDesignated accounts: You may only access your designated accounts with Capital One Bank.\nDaily limitation: A daily spending limitation exists on all ATM/Debit Cards. This limitation combines three categories: cash withdrawals, cash advances and point-of-sale purchases. You may not aggregate transactions during any one (1) day (including either cash withdrawals, purchases, cash advances or a combination of the three) that exceed the established card limit. See the chart below for the limits established for the card product that you have. The limits listed below are the current default limits for our standard ATM/Debit Card products. Some cards might have different prevailing limits for their product at time of issuance. We do offer specialty ATM/Debit Cards with different default limits. If you have received a Wealth Management debit card or a Deposit Only ATM card, please refer to the documentation you received when you opened your account for details about limits for these cards.",

  "text": "February 6, 2024 |9 min read\nCredit card fraud is the most common type of identity theft, according to data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nThe good news is that if this happens to you, there are steps to follow. And when reported, the impact of credit card fraud can be limited.\nKey takeaways\nVictims of credit card fraud should report it immediately to their card issuer.\nAn individual’s credit scores may be affected if fraudulent activity isn’t reported and bills go unpaid.\nChecking bills and credit reports regularly can help you identify potential fraudulent activity.\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act limits cardholders’ liability for unauthorized charges to $50.\nSome issuers, including Capital One, offer $0 liability for unauthorized charges.\nWhat is credit card fraud? \nCredit card fraud is a form of identity theft that occurs when someone uses another person’s credit card or credit card information to buy something or access an account without permission. The scammer doesn’t need to actually have the physical card to commit this type of fraud.\nCredit card fraud sometimes gets confused with credit card disputes. A dispute may occur when a cardholder doesn’t agree with how a company has used their card—but has still given them permission to use it. Generally, this isn’t considered credit card fraud. This applies even if a scammer has persuaded someone to purchase something with their credit card. In other words, if the cardholder has authorized the purchase—even under false pretenses—it may not be credit card fraud.\nBecause the process for disputing a charge is different from reporting fraud, cardholders need to be clear about whether they’re dealing with fraud or a dispute.\nTypes of credit card fraud \nCredit card fraud can take many different forms, and it’s getting more sophisticated all the time. Here are some common types:\nCard-not-present (CNP) fraud \nCNP fraud is committed over the phone or online when a scammer has the card details but not the physical card. This information could have been bought on the dark web—or could have been acquired through a phishing scam or data breach.\nCredit card skimming \nCredit card skimming occurs when someone creates a fake—or cloned—card using someone else’s information. Thieves place a device called a skimmer over the card slot on an ATM or other card reader, like at a gas pump. When you slide your card through the slot, the skimmer reads and stores all your data. Thankfully, cards that come equipped with EMV chips make it more difficult for scammers to create duplicate cards.\nCredit card application or account fraud \nFraudsters often get a hold of personal information by dumpster diving, skimming or stealing mail. With details like your home address, Social Security number and birth date, they might be able to access your credit card account or apply for a new card in your name.\nLost or stolen card fraud \nLost or stolen card fraud is an old-school credit fraud method. It can happen when a fraudster uses a card that someone has lost, whether they dropped it in the street, had it stolen in the mail or were pickpocketed.\nSigns of credit card fraud \nHere are some common signs to look for if you suspect credit card fraud:\nUnfamiliar transactions on monthly credit card statements\nSmall account charges, which hackers sometimes use to avoid detection\nBlocked access to an account \nChanges to a credit report that weren’t authorized, like new credit accounts or unfamiliar addresses\nUnexpected calls from creditors or collection agencies\nHow to report credit card fraud \nThe sooner credit card fraud is detected and reported, the quicker you can stop any unauthorized spending in your name. That can help protect your credit scores and limit your liability for any fraudulent charges.\nWhen credit card fraud—including credit card theft, unauthorized purchases and suspicious activity—is suspected, it should be reported immediately using these steps:\n1. Confirm the charges are fraudulent \nIf you’ve noticed one or more charges on your account you don’t recognize, you can follow these steps before reporting credit card fraud:\nGo back through your receipts to remind yourself where you’ve been, what you’ve bought and how much you’ve spent.\nLook up the merchant online to see if it has a parent company or a business name different from the one you know. That name might be the one that’s on your bill.\nCheck with any family members or friends authorized to use the account to make sure they didn’t make the transactions in question.\nYou could also set up instant purchase notifications in the Capital One Mobile app to monitor your account. You can enable notifications that include the amount of the purchase and information about the merchant.\n2. Contact the card issuer immediately \nIf you suspect credit card fraud, you should contact your credit card issuer immediately to report it. The issuer will then begin a fraud investigation where they will collect any necessary information to make their assessment.\nIf fraud is suspected, the card will likely be locked so that no one else can use it. You can also freeze your card directly through most credit card mobile apps. \nAs part of the process, the existing credit card will likely be canceled and a replacement card with a new number will be issued. \nIf you still have the physical card, you can call the toll-free number on the back of the card. If you don’t have it, you can also contact your card issuer by letter or email. \nMany companies also offer fraud reporting directly through their app or website.\n3. Set up a fraud alert with a credit bureau \nSetting up a credit card fraud alert with a credit bureau makes it harder for anyone to change the details of any existing credit accounts or to open new ones. When in place, a fraud alert requires potential lenders to verify the identity of the applicant before creating any new accounts in their name.\nTo set up a fraud alert, you only need to contact one of the three major credit bureaus—Equifax®, Experian® or TransUnion®. The bureau contacted will then alert the other two. The alert can also be canceled at any time.\nCredit freezes are a similar option. But they require you to set up a freeze at each individual bureau.\n4. Consider filing an FTC complaint \nFiling a report through the FTC at Identitytheft.gov can assist law enforcement agents in their investigation and in recovering any stolen belongings. The FTC refers any reports made to the relevant authorities and offers resources to help get victims back on track.\nHow to prevent credit card fraud \nTaking the steps above could help victims of credit card fraud. But there are also ways to prevent it from happening. Here are some tips from the FBI and the FTC to help prevent credit card fraud:\nEnable notifications and security features. Instant purchase notifications may help you keep track of spending in real time. Plus, fraud alerts and card lock features can help you spot unusual or suspicious charges or allow you to lock your card. Capital One customers can access and enable security features by adding the Capital One Mobile app to their phone or by signing in to their account online.\nKeep your account information secure. Don’t give account information over the phone without confirming that the caller is who they say they are. \nSecure the physical cards. Never lend a credit card to anyone, and shred any old cards, statements and receipts. Wallets or purses should also be closely guarded when out in public, and never leave them unattended.\nWatch out for suspicious behavior. Stay alert during any transaction that requires handing over a credit card. And don’t place your card into any card-reading device that seems unusual. This could include the device being loose, crooked or damaged.\nReview your statements and credit reports regularly. Save receipts to compare them with monthly statements, and make sure that everything looks correct. It’s also a good idea to check your credit reports as often as you can and question anything you don’t recognize.\nBe cautious when making online purchases. Be on the lookout for phishing scams that require opening a link or an attachment or ones that ask for money or personal information. And consider using virtual card numbers to help protect your credit card account for online transactions.\nMonitor your credit score. CreditWise from Capital One lets you monitor your credit score and receive alerts when something changes on your credit report. This can help you see potential fraud quickly. CreditWise also offers free dark web monitoring. And it’s free for everyone, not just Capital One cardholders.\nCredit card fraud FAQ \nHere are some of the most commonly asked questions about credit card fraud:\nAm I liable for fraudulent charges made to my card?\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act limits cardholders’ liability for unauthorized charges to $50. And as long as fraudulent charges are reported, many credit card companies won’t hold a cardholder responsible at all.\nCapital One, for example, offers $0 liability for unauthorized charges.\nCan credit card fraud affect credit scores?\nRemember: Many credit card companies won’t hold a cardholder responsible for reported fraudulent charges made to the account. But if it goes undetected or unreported, credit card fraud can negatively impact an individual’s credit scores.\nIs credit card fraud a felony?\nIn some cases, credit card fraud can be a federal felony. Under state law, it can depend on the state in which the crime is committed and the total amount of the fraudulent charges. \nPenalties for credit card fraud include imprisonment, fines and more.\nHow is credit card fraud investigated?\nDuring a credit card fraud investigation, card issuers may contact the merchant who authorized the transaction in question to get more information. This could also involve requesting police reports and receipts to compare signatures. \nThe card issuer must respond within 30 days of receiving a report, but the investigation can take up to 90 days. During this time, you won’t have to pay for the disputed charges, and you won’t get charged interest on them, either.\nCredit card fraud in a nutshell \nWhen someone steals your credit card or credit card information to make fraudulent purchases, it can impact your overall financial health. That’s why working to prevent credit card fraud is important. \nWhile the law and credit card issuers may be there to help, it’s still a good idea to be careful. Cardholders can learn the signs of fraud and act quickly to report suspected fraud and prevent it from happening.\nAnd there are many ways to help keep your credit cards safe from fraudsters. These include enabling your card’s security features, shredding old credit cards when you get new ones and not sharing account information over the phone. You can also use virtual card numbers to protect your credit card account for online transactions.",

  "text": "March 14, 2024 |6 min read\nIf you’ve shopped online, you’ve likely had to give your credit card information, including your card verification value (CVV) number, to make a purchase.\nA CVV is a security code that helps protect you from credit card fraud like identity theft. Keep reading to learn where you can find your CVV number, why your CVV number is important and how to help keep your online payments secure.\nA CVV number helps protect your card from unauthorized purchases.\nA CVV is different from a personal identification number (PIN). A CVV is typically used for online or phone transactions, and a PIN is often for in-person payments or using your debit card at an ATM.\nTo find your card’s CVV, look for a three-digit number on the back of the card or a four-digit number on the front of the card.\nWhat is a CVV on a credit card? \nA CVV code is a three- or four-digit number on a credit or debit card that helps prevent credit card fraud. It’s meant to protect cardholders from unauthorized transactions by providing a second layer of protection.\nA CVV number is also known by other names, including: \nCard security code (CSC)\nCard verification code (CVC)\nCard validation code 2 (CVC2)\nCard identification number (CID)\nWhat’s the difference between a CVV and a CVV2? \nYou may also see a CVV referred to as a CVV2. CVV2 is one of the various forms of CVV that are used to protect your account against unauthorized transactions.\nWhere to find your card’s CVV code \nLike your credit card number and expiration date, your CVV number often appears directly on your card. But its exact placement depends on the network.\nFor Visa®, Mastercard® and Discover® cards, the CVV is a three-digit number, and it usually appears on the back of the card, typically next to the signature box. American Express cards have four-digit CVV numbers, and they appear on the front of the card.\nWhy is a CVV number important and how can it protect you? \nYour CVV number adds another layer of protection to help you avoid credit card fraud. It’s a way for the merchant to confirm that the cardholder is the one using the card. And with credit card fraud being the most common type of identity theft, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it can play an important role in protecting your credit card information. \nThe Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council states that CVV numbers are considered sensitive authentication data. Merchants are required to protect the information and delete the CVV number after the purchase is authorized. \nKeep in mind that not all online merchants require you to provide your CVV number to make purchases. And a CVV may not protect you in all cases of credit card fraud.\nHow to protect your CVV code and credit card number \nMaking sure that your CVV and credit card number are safe at all times is important. Capital One has a variety of credit card security features to help you protect yourself. And there are always additional measures you can take:\n1. Be careful when saving your credit card or debit card information \nSaving your credit card or debit card information online might make checkout a breeze. But it could also lead to unauthorized purchases if your account is compromised. Consider adding an extra layer of protection by using virtual card numbers. They’re still linked to your credit card account, but they let you use a different number to fill out online payment information.\n2. Only shop with legitimate online merchants and websites \nIt goes without saying that there are illegitimate businesses on the internet. Steering clear of sharing your information with sites that you’re wary of goes a long way. If you’re making a purchase, be sure the site has an “s” after “http” (e.g., https://) in its URL—or a lock icon before the URL. Those are signs that the site is secure and data is encrypted.\n3. Watch out for phishing attempts \nHave you ever received a random text message that looked like a scam? Or maybe you received a strange call asking for personal information. Those were likely types of phishing scams. \nWhether they come in the form of an email, text message or phone call, try to beware of scams. And never share your personal information or click on any links you believe are fraudulent.\nThe FTC also recommends following these best practices:\nUnless you’re sure the caller is who they say they are, don’t give your account information over the phone. If you’re not sure, you could consider calling the organization directly instead.\nDon’t lend your card to anyone.\nUse multifactor authentication to help protect your accounts, if possible.\nMonitor your account often for any suspicious activity.\nSave your receipts to compare them with your monthly statement.\nWhen it’s time to get rid of old cards, statements and receipts, make sure you’re careful about how you get rid of them.\nIf you’re a Capital One cardholder, you can access and enable security features through the Capital One Mobile app or by signing in to your account online.\nCVV code FAQ \nLearn more about CVVs with the answers to these frequently asked questions:\nCVV stands for card verification value. You may also see it referred to as CVV2, CSC, CVC, CVC2 or CID.\nCVV numbers are issued based on numerous factors, including:\nAccount number\nExpiration date\nCard network\nWhat’s the difference between a CVV and a PIN?\nYour CVV and PIN aren’t the same. Your CVV is used to verify your identity and make more secure purchases online or over the phone. Your PIN is used to help verify your identity when you use your debit card at an ATM or for in-person purchases. Credit cards may also issue PINs for cash advances.\nDoes a CVV code guarantee protection from credit card fraud?\nA CVV code can make it more difficult for a would-be scammer to steal all the information needed to complete a fraudulent transaction online. Still, a CVV code can’t guarantee protection from credit card fraud. So it’s still important to protect your personal information and never share your financial details with anyone you don’t trust.\nCredit card CVVs in a nutshell \nAlthough CVV codes offer a level of protection, they can’t guarantee your information stays secure. Like other account information, be sure to keep your CVV private. If you’re worried about credit card fraud, remember to be cautious while shopping online—and know how to spot and avoid scams. \nAnother way you can help protect yourself is to regularly monitor your credit. Get free copies of your credit reports by visiting AnnualCreditReport.com. A great way to do this is by using CreditWise from Capital One. With CreditWise, you can access your free TransUnion® credit report and VantageScore® 3.0 credit score without hurting your score. Plus, it’s free and available to everyone, whether or not you’re a Capital One cardholder.",

  "text": "August 6, 2024 |7 min read\nAs technology continues to evolve, devices like smartphones, smartwatches, laptops and tablets have become helpful for completing a range of everyday tasks with just a few clicks. And that includes making purchases without needing your physical credit card. One way to do this is by using a digital wallet.\nLearn more about what digital wallets are, how they work and how they can simplify your money management.\nDigital wallets are electronic versions of your physical wallet and allow you to pay for things without using physical cards or cash.\nPopular digital wallets include Apple Pay®, Venmo, Google Pay™ and PayPal®, among others.\nYou can use your digital wallet to pay in stores, online and within apps for convenience where you shop. \nCapital One users can link their credit card or debit card to their digital wallets to make on-the-go purchases faster and more securely.\nWhat is a digital wallet? \nDigital wallets are apps or online services that allow you to make transactions electronically. You may access a digital wallet on your phone, laptop or other compatible electronic devices. \nYour digital wallet can often hold your debit cards, credit cards, loyalty cards, or even concert and airline tickets. This makes it easier for you to access funds and information you need when you need them. Plus, it can eliminate the clutter of several plastic cards and speed up transactions with a simple tap, click or swipe of your finger. \nDigital wallet vs. mobile wallet \nThe terms “digital wallet” and “mobile wallet” are often used interchangeably, but they are slightly different. Digital wallet is an umbrella term that includes mobile wallets. In other words, mobile wallets are a type of digital wallet, but not all digital wallets are mobile wallets. \nA digital wallet can store your payment information and be accessed on your desktop computer, laptop or mobile device. A mobile wallet is a type of digital wallet on a mobile device, like your smartphone or smartwatch. And you can use mobile wallets to make contactless in-store purchases at a store’s physical checkout.\nTypes of digital wallets \nThere are many different digital wallets available, with varying features and transaction capabilities. A few examples of digital wallets include:\nApple Pay®\nGoogle Pay™ \nPayPal\nVenmo\nSamsung Pay®\nBe sure to check compatibility with your devices when figuring out which wallet makes the most sense for your digital money management journey. \nHow do digital wallets work? \nMost digital wallets come with an app you can add to your computer, phone, watch or other smart device. When you’re out shopping, you can pay with most mobile wallets by holding your device near a terminal that has the contactless transaction symbol. The symbol looks like a sideways Wi-Fi symbol.\nTo complete the transaction, you might be required to provide a passcode or authenticate the transaction through fingerprint or facial recognition. From there, you can use the app to make purchases, pay someone directly or even access tickets for things like concerts or travel. For nonmobile digital wallets (shopping from a laptop), you might be prompted to sign in or provide a password.\nWhen it comes to the tech itself, digital wallets might use QR codes, near-field communication or magnetic secure transmission. This technology stores your information and allows you to complete transactions more securely. \nHow to use a digital wallet \nOne of the benefits of a digital wallet is access to quicker transactions. And that can come in handy—especially if you’re out and about and realize you left your physical wallet at home. Many retailers now have updated payment terminals that support contactless payments like mobile wallets and contactless cards.\nHere are just a few ways you can use your digital wallet: \nOnline: Digital wallets can make online shopping easier by automatically filling in your information for you. This way, you don’t have to enter your info each time, and you can check out in just a few clicks.\nOn the go: Simply tap and pay with your mobile wallet on your smartphone, smartwatch or other mobile device when you’re checking out in a store. \nIn apps: Use your digital wallet for easier and more secure in-app purchases. \nAt ATMs: You might also be able to use your mobile wallet instead of a physical card at some ATMs.\nDigital wallet advantages and disadvantages \nThere are several potential pros and cons of using a digital wallet. Some potential advantages to consider include: \nVirtual versions of credit cards, gift cards and more: Once they’re added to your digital wallet, you can access credit cards, gift cards, tickets and more from the app, even when you don’t have your physical wallet. \nContactless payment options: With a mobile wallet, you can use your smartphone, smartwatch or tablet to make payments without a physical card. Keep in mind that you’ll only be able to do so if the store supports contactless payments. \nQuicker transactions: Making purchases with your digital wallet can save you time since you won’t have to dig through your wallet for a physical card.\nAdditional security features: Digital wallets let you add extra layers of security like two-factor authentication, facial recognition and fingerprint scanning to access your wallet and authorize transactions.\nSome potential disadvantages to consider include: \nNot always compatible or accepted: Mobile wallet payments may not be an accepted form of payment at every vendor or store you visit.\nMust know how to set up and use: If you’re not comfortable setting up your digital wallet and adding cards to the app, it can be difficult to get your digital wallet up and running. But Capital One cardholders can easily add their eligible cards to certain digital wallets through the Capital One Mobile app.\nIncreased security risk if you lose your phone: If your phone gets stolen or you lose it, your digital wallet may not be as secure if your phone isn’t password protected and you don’t have two-factor authentication enabled for your digital and mobile wallet apps.\nKeep in mind that there are other contactless and digital payment methods to consider alongside digital wallets, such as virtual cards and contactless credit and debit cards. And many of Capital One’s U.S.-issued credit cards and debit cards feature contactless technology. These include popular credit cards like SavorOne, Quicksilver, QuicksilverOne and Platinum, as well as 360 Checking debit cards.\nAre digital wallets and mobile wallet apps safe? \nDigital wallets use some of the latest security features to help keep your information safe and prevent both identity theft and credit card fraud. These features include the following:\nTokenization can help protect your card information by creating unique “tokens” associated with your credit card number. Because you’re only sharing tokenized card details, retailers don’t have access to your actual card number, making it more difficult for fraudsters to view or use your financial information. \nYou can combine the safety features of the wallet with those of your phone or other devices. This includes two-factor authentication, Face ID, fingerprint ID, PINs and screen locks. \nBut what if your device is lost or stolen? Setting up additional security, like fingerprint ID and password protection, can help make your device more secure.\nAs with other forms of payment, digital wallets could be susceptible to hackers and scams. It’s important to use strong passwords and change them regularly, monitor your accounts, avoid making transactions on unsecured Wi-Fi networks and enable all the safety options mentioned previously.\nDigital wallets in a nutshell \nDigital wallets are exactly what they sound like, and they can be quicker and more secure than using physical cards or cash at checkout. Plus, you can set up your digital wallet and link your Capital One debit or credit cards in a few easy steps—making payments safer, faster and more convenient.\nReady to take advantage of the convenience that digital wallets provide?

  "text": "As financial technology evolves, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions have found ways to make online banking and digital money management more convenient for users. Mobile banking apps—including the Capital One Mobile app—let you check account balances and transfer money from your mobile device. And you can even deposit paper checks from virtually anywhere using your smartphone or tablet.\nBut what exactly is mobile check deposit, and how does it work? Also, is it a safe way to deposit money into your Capital One account? Read on for a step-by-step guide to the Capital One mobile check deposit process.\nMobile check deposit is a way to deposit a paper check through your banking app using a smartphone or tablet.\nYou can usually deposit U.S. personal, business or government checks, but there may be exclusions.\nCapital One customers can download the Capital One Mobile app to start making mobile deposits today.\nWhat is mobile check deposit? \nMobile check deposit is exactly that: a way to deposit a paper check using a mobile device. Traditionally, you’d need to track down an ATM or visit your bank or credit union to deposit a check. But mobile deposit allows you to snap a picture of the check using your smartphone or tablet camera and upload it through your mobile banking app.\nWhat types of checks can I deposit using mobile check deposit? \nThe types of checks you can deposit can vary depending on which financial institution you use. For instance, Capital One customers can generally deposit U.S. personal, business or government checks with their mobile banking app—but there may be exclusions. These could include: \nChecks that are undated, more than six months old or postdated\nChecks payable to anyone other than you or a joint account holder\nChecks payable to cash\nTraveler’s checks\nMoney orders\nForeign checks\nFor more information on the types of checks you can deposit through your Capital One Mobile app, check out these mobile deposit terms and conditions.\nHow does mobile check deposit work? \nMobile check deposit works by using a service called remote deposit capture. Think of it like scanning a document onto your computer. Essentially, remote deposit capture lets you take a digital image of your check. Your financial institution will then collect the images and process your deposit.\nDo mobile checks deposit instantly? \nIn most cases, mobile check deposits aren’t instantaneous. You may have to wait at least one business day for the mobile deposit to process, and some banks may also have a cutoff time for deposits. If you deposit a check after that time, you may have to wait another business day for it to process. \nTip: Capital One customers can typically access their funds the next business day. But if you deposit a check using your mobile app after 9 p.m. ET, your check may take additional time to process.\nIs mobile check deposit safe? \nMost banks and financial institutions—including Capital One—use advanced security features to keep your account safe. For example, Capital One protects your mobile deposits with encryption and device recognition technology. \nAlso, your check deposit information and photos won’t be stored on your smartphone. And using mobile check deposit can even make some types of check fraud more difficult. For instance, a thief may not be able to steal a check if you use your mobile device to deposit it quickly and then properly void or destroy it after the deposit is confirmed.\nThat said, there are some steps you can take to help protect your financial information when making a mobile check deposit: \nUse a strong password. Using a complex password—a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters or symbols—is one of the most effective ways to help keep your account safe.\nSet up two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure used to help verify your identity when you log in to your account. For instance, you may use Face ID initially, then have to input a PIN sent to your cellphone via text message. Enabling 2FA can help reduce the risk of someone else gaining access to your account.\nAvoid unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks when banking. Generally speaking, it’s a good idea to avoid using public Wi-Fi when performing any tasks that involve transferring sensitive information, like making a mobile deposit. Make sure you’ve got a secure connection before logging in to your account, or use your smartphone’s data connection instead.\nEnable mobile security alerts. Many mobile banking apps offer mobile security notifications or SMS text alerts, which can help you stay on top of potentially fraudulent activity. For example, Capital One Mobile app users can set up SMS fraud alerts from Eno, the Capital One virtual assistant. If Eno notices any unusual activity, it can reach out with a text message.\nStay on top of phishing scams. Phishing is a type of scam that occurs when fraudsters pretend to be legitimate sources, like your bank or credit card company, to access personal information. Phishing scams can take the form of text messages, emails or phone calls. And, in many cases, they look or sound deceptively similar to an official bank communication. To help protect your digital identity, avoid clicking links in emails or text messages. Instead, navigate directly to your banking app or its website.\nHow to make a mobile check deposit in 6 easy steps \nReady to make a mobile deposit using your Capital One Mobile app? Here’s how to deposit a check on the go using your smartphone or tablet.\n1. Understand deposit limits \nIn some cases, you may be limited on how much you can deposit per transaction, or on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Luckily, you can find that information in the Capital One Mobile app. Before you upload a photo of your check, the app will alert you to any applicable limits. If your check exceeds that amount, you can use the app’s branch locator to find an ATM or branch near you.\n2. Endorse the check \nNext, endorse the check you wish to deposit—just like you would if you were depositing it at your local branch. Capital One customers should write For Capital One mobile deposit below their signature on the back of the check before taking photos and uploading them through the mobile app.\n3. Open the mobile deposit feature in your banking app \nLog in to your Capital One Mobile banking app and select the account you want to deposit the check into, then click the Deposit option next to the camera icon. Then, input the deposit amount and any other requested information.\n4. Take photos of the check \nOnce you’ve added the deposit amount, it’s time to take a picture of your check. For best results, place your check on a flat, dark-background surface to improve clarity. Make sure all four corners of the check fit within the on-screen frame to avoid any processing holdups. Then, hit the camera icon in your mobile app to open the camera.\nOnce you’ve taken a clear photo of the front of the check, repeat the process on the back of the check.\n5. Confirm the details and submit your deposit \nReview the details of your check after uploading the images and ensure that the information is correct. Swipe the Slide to Deposit button to submit the deposit. \n6. Hold on to the check until the deposit is confirmed \nYour deposit request may have gone through, but it’s still a good idea to hold on to your check for a few days. Capital One recommends keeping the check in a safe, secure place until you see the full amount deposited in your account. After the deposit is confirmed, you can safely destroy the check.\nWhat if a mobile check deposit fails? \nMobile check deposit could fail for a number of reasons, including: \nWeak internet connection\nImages that are too dark, are too light or cut off parts of the check\nUnclear or missing information on the check\nGlitches within the mobile banking app\nIf you receive an error message, take some time to ensure you’ve endorsed the check, signed your full name, and verified the deposit amount and account details. Then, try taking new pictures. If your deposit request still doesn’t go through, you may consider reaching out to your financial institution for assistance.\nMobile check deposit FAQs \nStill curious about mobile check deposit?

  "text": "Cash advances are convenient, but it's important to understand how they work before requesting one.\nWhat is a cash advance? \nA cash advance is when you use your credit card to obtain cash, such as from an ATM or bank branch. But there are others types of transactions that are also considered cash advances, such as using your credit card to: transfer money to friends using apps like PayPal, Venmo or Moneygram, pay a debt (such as a car loan) using a third-party bill pay service, buy casino chips or lottery tickets, or exchange dollars for foreign currency.\nKnow the cost: \nCash advances usually include transaction fees and a higher APR than credit card purchases. With each cash advance, we charge a front-end fee, or service charge, that posts to your account the day of the transaction. Be sure to review your account terms for details.\nThings work a little differently when it comes to how payments are applied to cash advances. Check out your account terms so you'll know what to expect.\nKnow your cash advance limit and available credit for cash advances: \nLook at your most recent credit card statement and find your Cash Advance Limit. Keep in mind, sometimes ATMs have additional limits. You also must have sufficient total credit line available to take a cash advance. For example, if you have used all of your available credit for purchases, you cannot take a cash advance, even if you have not used all of your cash advance line.\nTo get a cash advance at an ATM with your Personal Identification Number (PIN): \nFollow the cash advance instructions displayed on the ATM\nMake sure you understand any fees that the ATM might charge in addition to those outlined in your account terms before completing the transaction\nHow to get a cash advance if you don’t have your PIN \nYou can take a cash advance inside a bank lobby that displays the Visa or MasterCard credit card logo. You’ll just need to provide a government issued photo ID like a driver's license along with your Capital One card.\nForgot your PIN? You can request a new one. It usually takes several days for your PIN to arrive in the mail, but you might be eligible to get one instantly by requesting it online.",

Here’s what you can expect throughout the process.\nBefore you file a dispute \nBefore you report a problem to Capital One, complete these steps and speed up the process of filing your claim.\nConfirm the charge is posted\nA pending transaction can’t be disputed because the amount may change or drop off of your account entirely. You can report a problem with a transaction once the transaction has been posted, which is generally within about 5 days. \nContact the merchant\nTry reaching out to the merchant to solve the problem first. Working with them directly is often the fastest way to settle issues. It can take up to 90 days for Capital One to resolve a dispute on your behalf. \nHave your paperwork on hand\nIf the issue hasn't been resolved after contacting the merchant, you’ll want to get your documents organized before filing your dispute with Capital One. Make sure to hang on to your documentation until your dispute is closed.\nExamples of things to gather:\nReceipts and invoices\nPictures of the product or service\nCommunications with the merchant to try to fix the issue\nWhen you file a dispute \nTo file a dispute digitally, you need to file the dispute within 90 days of the transaction date. If 90 days have passed, you can still file a dispute by calling the number on the back of your card.\nOne of the most convenient ways to report a problem with a charge is in the Capital One app or on the website. To start your dispute, select the transaction from your recent transaction list. Then select Report a problem and answer questions about the charge.\nHere’s how to sign up for an online account or download our mobile app.\nAfter you file a dispute \nOnce you submit your claim, here’s what to expect:\nCapital One will act as the \"go-between\" for you and the merchant, working on your behalf.\nWe may provide a temporary credit on your credit card account for the disputed amount and related fees and interest.\nWe might also place a hold on your available credit for the same amount. \nWithin 90 days, the process will be concluded and you’ll receive a message either online or in the mail that provides more details about the claim decision.\nThere are three possible outcomes:\nThe merchant is found responsible\nIf this happens, we’ll make the temporary credit permanent.\nThe merchant is not found responsible\nIn this case, we’ll remove the temporary credit and the original charge will be reapplied to your account.\nThe merchant is found partially responsible\nIn this case, we’ll remove the temporary credit and a portion of the original charge will be reapplied to your account.\nIf you’re not satisfied with the outcome, the message you get from Capital One will explain how to appeal the decision. \nWhat’s considered a dispute?\nYou can file a dispute claim when you’ve authorized a transaction, meaning you gave the merchant permission to charge you, but there's an issue with the product, service or transaction details. \nSome examples include:\nYou're still being charged for something you canceled\nYou didn't receive what you paid for\nWhat you received was not what was described\nYou've been charged twice for the same purchase\nHow long do I have to file a dispute?\nIf you want to file a dispute on our website or through the Capital One Mobile app you'll need to do so within 90 days of the transaction date. Otherwise, you can file a dispute at any time by calling the number on the back of your card. \nHow long does the dispute resolution process take?\nDisputes filed with Capital One will be resolved within 90 days.\nIf you're unable to reach the merchant about a charge, you can still file a dispute claim with Capital One. Documentation demonstrating your attempt to contact the merchant to resolve the issue could help strengthen your case, even if the merchant didn't respond.",

We apply any portion of your payment in excess of your minimum payment to higher rate balances before lower rate ones. If your payment exceeds the minimum payment by an amount sufficient to pay a higher rate balance shown on your statement, you still may have a balance at that higher rate on your next statement as a result of transactions, interest, or fees charged to your account before your payment was credited. For example, if your monthly statement shows a $1,000 balance for cash advances, sending in a check for $1,000 plus your minimum payment amount may not bring your cash advance balance to $0. This is because interest continues to accrue on the $1,000 balance between the last day of the statement and the date we receive your payment, but the interest does not post to your account until the next statement.",

  "text": "June 17, 2021 |5 min read\nMinority communities tend to be underrepresented, but the main barrier is being underestimated, especially in the financial services industry. These underserved communities face unique systemic barriers and challenges to owning and scaling a business.\nArlan Hamilton, the founder of Backstage Capital, talks through her book It’s About Damn Time: How to Turn Being Underestimated into Your Greatest Advantage in the Your Next Move live-event series by Inc. in partnership with Capital One Business. \nIn Hamilton’s experience, she had difficulty breaking into an industry dominated by white men, but she was able to take on these roadblocks and use them to create an advantage. \"I saw a world that felt like I did on the inside,” said Hamilton, whose firm invests in women, LGBTQ+ founders and people of color — and who identifies as all three. “I saw that passion and that moonshot thinking, and the optimism that was unbridled, and creativity that couldn't be measured.”\nHow underrepresentation affects minority communities in business \nTo identify underrepresentation and underestimation, let’s define what it is and how it affects minority entrepreneurs and the LGBTQ+ community.\nUnderrepresentation is defined as a statistical difference in the demographics of a given population. In business, this may present itself as not having enough diverse voices and employees in a company meeting room, or even not having enough funding to be a viable competitor within their industry. \nUnderestimation is defined as the belief that minority individuals have to work to overcome and correct initial impressions of those who have already made assumptions.\nHamilton noted the difference between underestimated and underrepresented like this: “The word underrepresented has this instant connotation of being the other, the less-than, the not-to-be-taken-as-seriously. As if they’re the ones who need more help.” \n“And the word help is used more than backing or funding,” she said. “But the word underestimated just reinforces what we already believe about ourselves, which is that you just haven't caught up yet. You just don't understand yet.” \nMinority communities work to overcome the challenges of both underrepresentation and underestimation at the same time. These challenges have a greater impact on minority communities because they have to divide their focus between these barriers and every other task on hand.\nChallenging the status quo as an underrepresented founder \nAt Backstage Capital, Hamilton works to break down barriers to the status quo. There’s space for everyone and anyone who wants to be in this industry, but it won’t come without its challenges. \nHamilton found that underrepresented and underestimated founders need different types of support.\nIn her experience, “We find that underrepresented, underestimated founders tend to be over-mentored and underfunded. So, we do have a mentorship program, but it’s about access more than anything.” \nHamilton also shared her views on what's to come as more companies and individuals become aware of the inherent disadvantages. “My thinking was, if someone were to figure out how to challenge this status quo, the opportunities that lie ahead would be immeasurable. And not just for underestimated, underrepresented founders—but everyone.” \nConfidence within new investors \nThere’s hope for new investors and founders coming into the space. \"You see this wonderful new generation of angel investors and of syndicate investors and small fund investors who are coming into their own and really bringing a fresh perspective to things, “ Hamilton emphasized. \nFrom an investor’s point of view, the new generation is looking past underestimation and using it to their advantage instead of being stuck in the belief they couldn't achieve their aspirations. “Thank goodness that the majority of them didn't get stuck in this belief that they couldn't, that they felt that they were underestimated rather than stopped at the door.\"\nHamilton noted that when the savvy investors she knows hear underrepresented, they’re often hearing homework. “But if you say underestimated they hear the word challenge — something untapped, something interesting and intriguing that I haven’t learned enough about. You immediately tap into something on both sides that makes everybody rise to the occasion,” she said. \nHow to overcome underestimation as a minority entrepreneur \nHere are some ways you can use underestimation to your advantage. \nProve people’s assumptions wrong. Before walking into rooms — literally and figuratively — remind yourself of who you are, where you come from, what strength lies within. It’s not about proving the person wrong, but their assumptions. What do you imagine they’re assuming about you? \nLeverage your value. Be confident in the qualities you bring to the table. Find the things that make you unique and stand out from the rest. If you’re unsure on how to find that leverage, start to reverse engineer your dreams. Ask yourself what type of company you’d like to work for and the type of boss you’d like to be. And if those don’t exist, build your own. \nEvaluate each challenge differently. Understand that each situation will be different from the rest. Recognize that change and adversity is inevitable, but within each are valuable lessons, memories and opportunities that add to your experience. \n\"I'm realistic: There's active racism in this world of startup investing and startup creation,” said Hamilton. “There's active misogyny; there's active homophobia. But by and large, what I notice over and over again is that it’s just a really incredible world that was meant for us all.” \nCommitting to change \nBoth inside and outside of Capital One, we’re committed to celebrating and supporting diverse business owners and the LGBTQ+ community. No matter your pronouns or how you identify, we’re an ally, and we welcome you for who you are and the perspective you bring. \nTo learn more about using underrepresentation as an advantage, as well as other insights and resources to help move your business forward, check out the Capital One Business Hub.\nCapital One Business\nResources and tools to help move your business forward from the experts at Capital One.",

  "text": "July 22, 2021 |5 min read\nAmid the uncertainty and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses are taking this time to reassess their capital growth strategies. \nMore traditional businesses are focusing on paying down their debts and are actively growing their savings by holding on to cash. More risk-tolerant companies are using the disruption as a chance to grow and invest in new technologies and opportunities. \nDeciding which capital model or cash strategy is right for your business requires the managerial team and owners to consider the unique circumstances the company is facing. So how can you ensure you’re making the right choices for your company’s financial position? Here are a few things to keep in mind that can help you balance your capital expenditures and savings strategy to keep your business growing and stable.\nMaintain a healthy source of emergency cash \nEmergencies happen all the time. Make sure your company is ready for them by having a strong supply of emergency cash on hand. Opening a business bank account can help you manage and monitor your cash flow more effectively. If you don’t have the capital on hand, consider opening a line of credit that will help you cover emergency expenses when they come up. \nIn addition, keep an eye on your company’s cash flow rather than focusing on revenue alone. Ultimately, a company with $1 million in revenue that maintains enough cash to cover expenses for two months is more viable than a company making $10 million that can’t cover its expenses for a couple of weeks.\nYou can work with your banker to find ways to leverage your current cash supply. Consider additional ways to boost cash flow, like digital payment programs. These programs may help make it easier for your customers to pay you, which then makes it faster for you to receive funds and easier for you to generate savings by reducing the cost of payment processing.\nPrioritize capital expenditure needs \nCapital expenditure is part of business. But during times of economic recovery, it’s important to carefully assess capital expenditure needs. While capital expenditures like purchasing new equipment or technology or investing in building improvements can help you take advantage of growth opportunities, they can also impact your balance sheet. Look at the long-term costs associated with the investment. This means doing a deep dive into your company’s operations and considering these key factors:\nLabor - Before investing in new equipment or products, consider the impact of those investments on your labor costs. For example, a $1 million system won’t benefit your company if you can’t find the right person to run the system. Make sure the investment will work for you rather than create a burden on your balance sheet.\nSupply - Consider the macro environment of your industry and any shortages that could drive up costs in the short term. These could include materials like microchips, paper products, lumber or other raw materials needed for your product. Shortages can increase the prices you’ll pay for your regular expenses. Make sure you’re able to justify the added cost and that the cost won’t negatively impact profitability and sustainability.\nRethinking the business strategy \nIf you’re weighing the benefits of holding cash versus investing, it’s a good idea to rethink your business’s strategy. For example, if your revenue remained constant throughout the pandemic, but your margins shrank, you’ll need to assess whether your sources of revenue are truly working for you. You might need to rebalance your clients or book of business to free up cash flow.\nIf shutdowns impacted your business, you’ll need to do things differently to remain competitive. Tightening your belt and ignoring the potential benefits of investing idle cash may not benefit your business enough. You may need to consider using a different operating model to restore your company to its normal level of profitability.\nMaking smart changes to remain competitive \nIt’s natural for businesses to make some changes based on supply and demand trends and business priorities. Be willing to look at your company’s operations and weigh the costs and benefits of holding cash versus investing it. If you understand your company’s position, you’ll be able to make adjustments quickly. This can help you create a resilient and sustainable plan for the future.",

  "text": "BEC is a sophisticated scam in which fraudsters disguise themselves as a trusted entity and trick either an individual or a business into performing a transfer of funds through wire transfer, ACH or checks. The victim believes they’re conducting a legitimate transaction, only to find out later it was fraudulent, potentially resulting in significant losses.\nWhen BEC scams first surfaced, fraudsters typically spoofed email addresses of C-level executives to request wire payments be sent to accounts owned by the fraudster. A spoofed email is when someone manipulates an email address to resemble a trusted one:\nValid email address: janedoe@capitalone.com\nSpoofed email address: janedoe@capitalon3.com\nThese instances still happen frequently and can be identified by taking a closer look at the email address information.\nFraudsters have evolved their schemes dramatically over the years and will sometimes compromise an email address or an entire email chain. This can be done by getting a victim to click on a phishing email or download a malicious attachment, which allows the fraudsters to compromise the targeted email address. They can then send and receive emails from what others may believe is a trusted source. In other instances, an entire email chain may be intercepted and manipulated by a fraudster or a team of fraudsters. In this example, fraudsters will insert themselves—using spoofed email addresses—into an existing email chain and begin to control the conversation. Being cognizant of this possibility can help mitigate the risk of falling victim to a request in an intercepted email chain.\nYou should also be mindful of other BEC schemes like spoofed emails from legal entities, requests for W-2 information or requests for gift card codes instead of cash.\nAs BEC has become an increasingly popular cybercrime, the number of reports and associated losses have also increased. The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), releases its annual Internet Crime Report to cover statistics and topics from the past year.\nIn its 2020 annual report, IC3 noted the following statistics and findings about BEC:\n19,360 BEC complaints were received in 2020 \n63,517 BEC complaints were received between 2018 and 2020\n$1.8 billion was lost as a result of BEC in 2020, up from $263 million in 2015, which is an increase of 584% over that period\n$4.9 billion+ was lost as a result of BEC between 2018 and 2020, with increases year over year",

  "text": "If you’ve ever felt stressed about money, you’re not alone. According to a recent CreditWise survey, 73% of people consider their finances to be a major source of stress in their lives, causing more angst than politics (59%), work (49%), or family (46%). That was particularly true for Millennials and Generation Z, eight out of 10 of whom reported being stressed by their money situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified those concerns, and is inspiring many people to re-analyze what financial well-being means to them.\nAt Capital One, we believe that you should have a healthy relationship with your money. After all, money affects every single area of life, from education to marriage and having children, to how well you enjoy your golden years. That’s why we’re proud to be launching our new Money & Life Program, which builds upon our former Money Coaching program.\nThis free program is available to anyone, regardless of your financial journey or whether they are a Capital One customer. Instead of traditional coaching and financial advising programs which can bring up difficult emotions, the Money & Life Program aims to help you reflect on your relationship with money and adopt new habits, perspectives, and behaviors that will help you reach your goals. The Money & Life Program currently offers three experiences: 1:1 mentoring, workshops, and self-guided digital exercises. \nMoney & Life Mentoring\nPreviously, participants could book appointments to work 1:1 with a Money Coach at most Capital One Cafés. Folks saw tremendous value in Money Coaching, so we decided to expand the program with more offerings, in more locations—including your own home. \nThus, the program has evolved into a mentorship model, in which mentors will work individually with participants, helping you reflect on how money fits into your life in a judgement-free zone. Professional mentors will help you identify your financial goals, and determine new habits and behaviors that can help you get closer to and better align with your unique goals.\nEveryone is eligible for up to three 1:1 mentoring sessions. These can be a virtual 1:1 mentoring session from wherever you live.\nMoney & Life Workshops\nCapital One is also excited to announce that money workshops will be part of the Money & Life Program, currently available on-demand and eventually available in person, covering real-life financial topics.\nTalk Money with Your Honey is designed to help you and your partner explore your respective pasts and how they have influenced your feelings about money, providing guidance on establishing healthy communication skills about your financial goals and how to achieve them. Your Money, Your Values examines the relationship between—you guessed it—your money and values, and how your financial habits can influence (or impede) your goals. It ultimately helps you understand how you can spend and save your money in ways that feel most purposeful and in line with what you care about the most.\nMoney & Life Workshops are meant to be a catalyst for sparking inspiration within your social group. You can attend a solo, or take the class with friends and family. Why take a workshop together? Research shows that adopting a new wellness habit – whether that’s exercising consistently, eating healthier, or improving your finances – is easier to do when you’re surrounded by like-minded people. You gain the benefit of sharing your struggles and successes, and that can ultimately push you to be more successful in your journey towards financial wellness than if you were trying to go it alone. \nMoney & Life Exercises\nThe topic of money takes time and reflection, and that’s exactly what our new self-guided exercises are designed to help with. \nAs a part of this new Money & Life Program, we offer self-guided digital exercises, such as Map Your Spend, Goals Planner (coming later this year) and more. You can complete these exercises at your own pace, either alone or in tandem with the mentoring and workshop aspects of the Money & Life Program. These exercises can help you reflect individually on your current relationship with money, and whether or not that’s ultimately in line with the life you want to live. \nThese self-guided exercises, along with mentoring and workshops, can help you gain clarity about your finances so that you can take positive action. At Capital One, we believe in being intentional with money so that you can live life on your terms, and that’s why we’re so excited to share our new Money & Life Program with you and your family. \nWe hope you found this helpful.

  "text": "September 30, 2021 |7 min read\nIf you’re like most people, you’ve got money on your mind. You may ask yourself: Do I have enough saved? Could I make better choices? Will I ever reach my goals? \nThat’s where Money & Life Mentoring, part of the Money & Life Program at Capital One, comes in. It can help you see how money fits into your life so you can make healthier decisions. Here’s how three people used mentoring to define their goals and create a plan for going after them.\nHelping people examine their beliefs and behaviors \nTammi Scott is a Money & Life Mentor at Capital One. Clients come to her with a variety of needs around finances and life—for example, looking for ways to pay off debt or finding time for the things that matter most to them. \nIt’s Tammi’s job to help them examine their values and beliefs, make positive adjustments to their behaviors, and work toward their goals.\n“I start by asking one question,” she says. “What do you really want for your life?”\nHere’s how three clients worked with Tammi to answer that question—and the “aha” moments that resulted.\n“Aha” moment 1: Realizing theres no \"right\" way to manage money \nTammi once had a client in her early 30s who came to mentoring for clarity around her money choices. \nThe client was taking a practical approach to her money, living within her means and saving for unexpected expenses. But she worried that she wasn’t managing her money in the “right” way. \nTammi helped her client realize there wasn’t an ideal way to use her money—just the way that worked for her. \nThen she helped her identify what was important in her life—security, fun and community. And they talked about how money could support the client in a life that aligned with her values.\nAction plan: Through mentoring, the client adjusted her life and budget based on the values she identified. \nThe Money & Life Program helps clients consider how to use both money and time, which ideally work together. With that in mind, here’s how the client did it:\nSecurity: She opened a savings account that she used as an “emergency fund” and continued to save toward retirement through her company-sponsored plan.\nFun: She added an “entertainment” category to her budget and found low-cost ways to enjoy herself like getting out in nature.\nCommunity: She “gave back” by doing volunteer work with a local organization that had meaning for her.\n“Aha” moment 2: Changing self-defeating money behaviors \nAnother of Tammi’s clients—this one was also in his early 30s—needed help with choices around money. He was discouraged by his debt and particularly concerned about paying off student loans. \nThe client had a habit of making online purchases, believing they weren’t really adding up. He also spent money when he felt down in order to experience a temporary lift in his mood, which often led to exceeding his means.\nDuring mentoring sessions, the client identified short-, medium- and long-term goals. He made it his priority to focus on those in the short term (ideally accomplished in six months) and the medium term (ideally accomplished in one to two years). To stay on course meant asking himself questions like, “If I make this small purchase now, will it move me closer to my goals or further from them?”\nAction plan: The client took what he learned from mentoring and started working toward his short- and medium-term goals. \nThese were his major action items: \nTrack small purchases, since they can add up and make it harder to save while paying off debt.\nUse practical money-management tips like setting up a budget to help reach his goals. \nManage low moods by finding other ways to deal with uncomfortable feelings—for example, going for a walk or calling a friend.\n“Aha” moment 3: Balancing living for today with planning for tomorrow \nAnother client of Tammi’s signed up for mentoring to get some perspective on planning for the future. Specifically, she worried that she wasn’t saving enough for retirement.\nBut she also wanted balance. Since she was only in her 40s and more than 20 years from retirement, she wanted to enjoy life now while also planning for tomorrow.\nThrough mentoring, the client defined what it would look like to enjoy retirement based on her priorities. In her case, it meant having financial security that allowed her to live a full life.\nThe client also realized that she should combine what she learned in mentoring with advice from a certified financial planner. She needed the extra guidance to keep from wondering whether she was doing “enough”—which often led to a cycle of inaction and worry.\nAction plan: Through mentoring, the client found ways to live in the “now” while making retirement planning more tangible. \nHere are the action items that topped her list: \nMake more time for things that brought her joy—family, friends and travel.\nContinue saving for retirement.\nMeet with a certified financial planner to see the math and create a plan for reaching her retirement goals.\nThe Money & Life Program offers mentoring and more \nA healthy relationship with money is important to everyone. That’s why the Money & Life Program is free for anyone, even if you’re not a Capital One customer.\nAnd since people enjoy learning in different ways, the program gives you options—all virtual for now. You can choose the one that works best for you or try all three:\nMoney & Life Mentoring: Meet virtually one-on-one with a professional Money & Life Mentor, who’ll help you reflect on how money fits into your life. You’ll also examine how you can adapt your financial behaviors to better achieve your goals.\nMoney & Life Workshops: See how powerful things happen in group settings in a workshop run by a professional mentor. You’ll learn along with others, have new realizations about your own life and start creating a plan for financial well-being.\nMoney & Life Exercises: Take self-guided exercises that help you become more aware of the ways financial stress is showing up in your life. Once you understand the stress, you can start to manage it—instead of the other way around.\nNo matter which option you choose, the Money & Life Program helps you plan out your goals in life—and connect them with your financial behaviors. So you can reach for your dreams more comfortably and confidently.\nAfter all, it’s your money, your life and your goals. And the power to reach them is within you.",
